I have completed the translation of the entire research paper "The LLM Surgeon" from English to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact same structure as the original document, including:

1. **Title and Abstract** - Translated the title to "Bác sĩ phẫu thuật LLM" and provided complete Vietnamese translation of the abstract
2. **Introduction** - Full translation of the introduction section 
3. **Background and Related Work** - Complete translation of all subsections including Taylor expansion, Fisher information matrix, and pruning as constrained optimization
4. **LLM Surgeon Methodology** - Full translation of all technical sections including algorithm descriptions, curvature estimation, cost computation, dynamic weight allocation, correlated weight updates, multi-shot pruning, and low-rank corrections
5. **Results** - Complete translation of all experimental results including structured compression, semi-structured compression, unstructured compression, and learned sparsity structure
6. **Conclusion** - Full translation of the conclusion section
7. **All Appendices** - Complete translation of all appendices A through J, including mathematical derivations, experimental details, technical details, downstream task performance, additional experiments, ablations, computational performance analysis, and code references

The translation preserves all mathematical formulas, technical terminology, figure captions, table structures, and references exactly as they appear in the original document. All technical terms are appropriately translated to Vietnamese while maintaining scientific accuracy and clarity.
