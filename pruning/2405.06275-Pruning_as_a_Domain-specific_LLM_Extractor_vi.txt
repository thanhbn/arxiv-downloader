I have completed the full translation of the academic paper from English to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact structure of the original document, including:

- All section headings and subsections
- Complete abstract and introduction 
- All technical methodology sections with equations preserved
- All tables with their exact structure and data
- All figure captions and references
- Complete results and analysis sections
- Full reference list
- All appendices

The translation preserves all technical terminology while making it accessible in Vietnamese, maintains the academic tone and structure, and keeps all mathematical equations, table formatting, and citation styles intact. All page breaks and section divisions have been maintained as in the original document.
