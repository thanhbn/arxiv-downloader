Abstract
Despite a growing interest in diffusion-based language models, existing work has
not shown that these models can attain nontrivial likelihoods on standard language
modeling benchmarks. In this work, we take the first steps towards closing the
likelihood gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based language models, with
the goal of building and releasing a diffusion model which outperforms a small
but widely-known autoregressive model. We pursue this goal through algorithmic
improvements, scaling laws, and increased compute. On the algorithmic front,
we introduce several methodological improvements for the maximum-likelihood
training of diffusion language models. We then study scaling laws for our diffusion
models and find compute-optimal training regimes which differ substantially from
autoregressive models. Using our methods and scaling analysis, we train and
release Plaid 1B, a large diffusion language model which outperforms GPT-2 124M
in likelihood on benchmark datasets and generates fluent samples in unconditional
and zero-shot control settings.1
1 Introduction
Large language models lie at the center of recent advances in artificial intelligence. Shared across
nearly all such language models is a common recipe: learn a model that maximizes data likelihoods
using an autoregressive, left-to-right factorization. Maximum-likelihood pretraining has been a
remarkably successful paradigm, leading to models that perform well on a range of downstream tasks
and display complex behaviors like in-context learning [1, 28].
Thus far, autoregressive modeling has been a core part of this process due to its computational
efficiency and empirical performance. However, this choice carries drawbacks. Autoregressive models
generate tokens one at a time, making it difficult to perform long-range planning or controllable
generation [ 17,19,21]. In addition, certain sequence distributions may be fundamentally more
difficult to model autoregressively [22].
Given the importance of language modeling, these potential drawbacks motivate us to explore
alternatives to the autoregressive approach. As a promising candidate, we turn to continuous diffusion
models [ 32,12], which have achieved state-of-the-art results in image modeling [ 5,30,31]. In
language, prior works on diffusion models exist [e.g. 21,10,6], but these optimize non-likelihood-
based objectives. Without the ability to use standard likelihood-based benchmarks [ 25,14,26], it
is difficult to say precisely how these models compare to autoregressive models (see Section 7 for
a discussion). Somewhat concerningly, there is no work showing that it is possible for diffusion
language models to achieve any nontrivial likelihoods on standard benchmarks.
In this work, we explore the limits of likelihood-based diffusion language models. Our goal is to
train and release a diffusion model which achieves better likelihoods than GPT-2 124M [29], which
we consider the smallest widely-adopted autoregressive model today. To achieve this goal, we first

develop an algorithmic framework, then study its scaling laws to enable compute-optimal training,
and finally train a large model called Plaid 1B.
Our contributions are as follows:
1.We explore the design space of likelihood-based diffusion language models and propose
an algorithmic framework called Plaid. We validate the design choices of Plaid through
compute-matched ablations.
2.We study the scaling laws of Plaid training. Our analysis shows that the log-likelihood of
Plaid models improves predictably with more compute. We derive a recipe for compute-
optimal training which differs substantially from the usual autoregressive rule.
3.We train and release Plaid 1B, a large diffusion language model pretrained on OpenWeb-
Text2 [ 7]. Plaid 1B outperforms GPT-2 124M in zero-shot likelihood across six standard
benchmarks. We demonstrate Plaid 1B’s ability to perform fluent and controllable text
generation.
2 Variational Diffusion Models for language
In this background section, we formally define continuous diffusion models over text sequences,
adopting the Variational Diffusion Models (VDM) framework [ 18] which is a natural fit for likelihood-
based training (see Karras et al. [16] for a survey on other formalisms). For brevity, we simplify some
details in our exposition and refer the reader to Kingma et al. [18] for details.
Consistent with prior work (e.g. Li et al. [21]), our basic approach will be to map discrete text
sequences into a continuous space with a token-wise embedding function and then construct a
diffusion model on the embedded data.
2.1 Forward diffusion process
Consider a sequence of tokens x= [x(1), . . . , x(L)]drawn from the data distribution q(x). We
transform xinto a sequence ˜xof embedding vectors using an invertible token-wise embedding
function Embed( ·), such that ˜x(i):= Embed( x(i)).
Theforward process is a Markov chain over latent variables ztfrom t= 0tot= 1which progres-
sively adds Gaussian noise to ˜x. Letσ2(t)be some monotonic function that specifies the total noise
2

--- PAGE 3 ---
added by time t. We then define the forward process distribution qwithTdiscrete timesteps as
q(x, z) :=q(x)q(z0|x)TY
i=1q(zi/T|z(i−1)/T) (1)
where q(z0|x) :=N(˜x, σ2(0)) andq(zt|zs) :=N(zs, σ2(t)−σ2(s)). It follows from this that
q(zs|zt,˜x)is also Gaussian, which will be useful later.
2.2 Reverse generative process
We can approximate the forward process distribution qby a learned Markov reverse process where
time runs backward from t= 1tot= 0. The reverse process with Ttimesteps is defined via the
decomposition
pθ(x, z) :=p(z1) TY
i=1pθ(z(i−1)/T|zi/T)!
p(x|z0). (2)
Letz(i)
tdenote the portion of ztat sequence position i. Then we choose p(z1) :=N(0, σ2(1)I)and
p(x|z0) :=Q
ip(x(i)|z(i)
0)where p(x(i)|z(i)
0)∝q(z(i)
0|xi). Recalling that q(z(i−1)/T|zi/T,˜x)is
Gaussian, for the remaining factors we choose pθ(z(i−1)/T|zi/T) :=q(z(i−1)/T|zi/T,˜x= ˆxθ(zi/T))
where ˆxθ(zt)is adenoiser neural network that approximates Eq[˜x|zt]. Finally, our generative model
is given by the marginal distribution pθ(x) =R
zpθ(x, z). Ifˆxθis optimal, then the forward and
reverse processes express the same joint distribution as σ2(0)→0,σ2(1)→ ∞ , and T→ ∞ .
2.3 Likelihood bound
To optimize and evaluate the likelihood, we can write a variational lower bound (VLB) for the
log-likelihood as
−logpθ(x)≤ −VLB( x) :=DKL(q(z1|x)∥p(z1)) + Eq(z0|x)[−logp(x|z0)] +LT (3)
where
LT:=TX
i=1Eq(zi/T|x)[DKL(q(z(i−1)/T|zi/T, x)∥pθ(z(i−1)/T|zi/T))]. (4)
In the T→ ∞ limit,LTsimplifies to
L∞=−1
2Et∼U[0,1],zt∼q(zt|x)[SNR′(t)∥x−ˆxθ(zt)∥2
2] (5)
where SNR′(t) :=d
dt1
σ2(t). We use Monte-Carlo estimates of the resulting continuous-time likeli-
hood bound to train and evaluate our model.
2.4 Learned noise schedule
A crucial hyperparameter in diffusion models is the noise schedule σ2(t), which specifies how much
noise to add at each time in the diffusion process. In our setting, the VLB is differentiable with
respect to σ2(t)via the reparameterization trick. Moreover, the VLB is invariant to the value of σ2(t)
except at t= 0andt= 1in the continuous-time limit.
We can therefore parameterize σ2(t)as a scalar-to-scalar neural network and learn it by gradient
descent. We train the endpoints σ2(0)andσ2(1)to maximize the VLB, and the schedule in between
the endpoints to minimize the variance of the Monte-Carlo estimate of the VLB. Minimizing the loss
variance is a proxy for minimizing the gradient covariance trace, which generally speeds up learning.
See Kingma et al. [18] for further implementation details about this training procedure.
3 The Plaid framework
In this section, we present a series of algorithmic improvements to the basic setup described in
Section 2. The result is a framework for diffusion language models which we refer to as Plaid
(Perplexity-based LAnguage Inverse Diffusion).
3

--- PAGE 4 ---
3.1 Learned embeddings
In an autoregressive language model, the embedding operation is simply the first layer of the neural
network and thus can be treated as just another part of the network. This is not true of embeddings in
diffusion language models, which play a more fundamental role: they determine the order in which
different tokens get generated. Tokens whose embeddings are far apart become distinguishable early
in the reverse process, whereas nearby embeddings are distinguishable only later, at low noise levels.
Despite the importance of embeddings in diffusion language models, the loss functions used in prior
work [ 21,6] lead to ill-posed problems when optimized over WEmbed : for example, if our objective
isL2reconstruction, then collapsing the embeddings by setting WEmbed = 0andˆxθ(zt) = 0 yields
a degenerate solution with zero loss. Prior work addresses this with workarounds like choosing
WEmbed by hand [3, 33] or using heuristic regularizers [21] or constraints [6].
In contrast, the Plaid loss function is a bound on the log-likelihood of the discrete data, which is
a meaningful objective over both the model weights and embeddings. We therefore optimize the
embedding matrix WEmbed jointly with the rest of the model without additional constraints.
3.2 Categorical reparameterization
When optimally trained, ˆxθ(zt)learns to approximate a conditional expectation E[˜x|zt]over se-
quences of word embeddings ˜x. At low noise levels, some or all of the embeddings in ˜xare
deterministic given zt, so an optimal ˆxθ(zt)should output these exactly. However, doing so requires
memorizing embedding vectors to high precision somewhere inside the model parameters, which is a
poor use of capacity.
Instead of forcing the model to memorize the embedding vectors, we reparameterize ˆxθ(zt)as
an average of embeddings weighted by a softmax over tokens. More formally, let fθ(zt)be a
neural network which outputs logits and define ˆxas an average over embeddings ˆx(i)
θ(zt) :=
WEmbed softmax( f(i)
θ(zt)). We can interpret fas learning a posterior over each discrete token x(i)
given zt. This relates to methods proposed in prior work, but these either require proxy objectives
[21, 6] or consider image models [3].
3.3 Output prior
When we interpret fθas a posterior over tokens, the optimal value of fθ(zt)islogq(x(i)|zt) +Z,
which decomposes as logq(z(i)
t|x(i)) + log q(x(i)|z(̸=i)
t) +Zwhere z(̸=i)
t:={z(j)
t:j̸=i}. We
view the first term as a prior constraining the model’s predictions to those which are plausible given
zt, while the second term models relationships between different tokens.
To make it easier to model fθ, we compute the first term in closed form as the log-density of a
Gaussian N(˜x(i), σ2(t)I)and add it to the output. This leaves the neural network with only the
easier task of estimating logp(x(i)|z(̸=i)
t). Empirically, we found it helpful to linearly anneal in this
prior over the first 5000 steps of training.
3.4 Learned conditional likelihood
Recall that our loss function (3)includes a conditional likelihood term logp(x|z0). We are free to
choose phowever we wish, and in Section 2 we chose a position-wise factorial model p(x|z0) :=Q
ip(x(i)|z(i)
0), with a simple fixed distribution for each factor. This choice is optimal for sufficiently
small σ2(0), but using a more powerful model allows σ2(0)to take a larger value, effectively
truncating the reverse process and therefore making it simpler to learn.
Here we leverage the fact that, after applying the categorical reparameterization (Section 3.2), our
neural network fθ(zt)can be interpreted as learning the logits for q(x(i)|zt)at all positions i. We
therefore choose to keep p(x|z0)as a factorial model, but define each factor p(xi|z(i)
0)using the more
powerful learned model softmax( f(i)
θ(zt)).
Implementing this change naively requires two evaluations of fθfor each minibatch example during
training, corresponding to the two terms of (3)L∞andlogpθ(x|z0). We instead split each minibatch,

using some examples to compute L∞and the rest to compute logpθ(x|z0). We allocate examples
between the two terms according to the ratioq
Var(L∞)
Var(log pθ(x|z0)), where we compute the variances
using running estimates of each term’s first and second moments. This minimizes the variance of the
full loss (3).
3.5 Self-conditioning
Self-conditioning [ 3] is a technique which improve the performance of diffusion language models.
The core idea is to reparameterize the denoiser ˆxθ(zt)as the fixed point y∞of a recurrence y0:=
0, yi+1:= ˆx′
θ(zt, yi)where ˆx′
θis a neural network which now takes two inputs instead of one. During
training, we approximate the fixed point y∞by randomly unrolling the recurrence to either y1(with
probability 0.75) ory2(otherwise). When we unroll to y2during training, we zero the gradients
with respect to y1, the noise schedule, and the embeddings. During held-out likelihood evaluation,
we always unroll to y2. During sampling, instead of solving the recurrence from scratch at each
step of the diffusion chain, we compute ˆx′
θ(z1,0)for the first step and ˆx′
θ(zt,ˆx′
θ(zt+(1/T), . . .))for
subsequent steps.
3.6 Other details
We perform all forward and backward computations in double precision except for the Transformer
layers themselves, which happen in bfloat16 mixed precision. This comes at a negligible extra cost
since the Transformer layers dominate the overall cost.
Architecture choices We condition ˆxθ(zt)on the timestep tby adding a sinusoidal encoding of t
to the Transformer’s residual stream before the first layer. Before feeding ztinto the Transformer, we
rescale it by a factor ofp
1 +σ2(t)which makes each input dimension approximately unit-variance.
Whereas autoregressive Transformers are relatively insensitive to aspect ratio [ 15], we find that Plaid
performance increases significantly with Transformer depth up to about 16 layers. We also find that
performance is sensitive to the choice of embedding dimension, with small values performing best.
In all experiments, we use embedding dimension 16.
Stochastic sequence length Unlike autoregressive models, diffusion language models can only
operate on sequences of exactly the same length as those seen during training. To enable our model
to generalize to shorter sequence lengths, we truncate a small random subset of examples seen
during training to random lengths. We observe that truncating even 3% of examples allows the
model to generalize well across lengths without impacting full-length performance. Short-sequence
performance does not improve substantially as we increase the number of truncated examples.
4 Ablation experiments
In this section, we validate different aspects of the Plaid framework through compute-matched
ablation experiments.

--- PAGE 6 ---
4.1 Validating likelihood-based training
We take a likelihood-based approach in this work for multiple reasons: it has a principled interpreta-
tion, it simplifies training and evaluation, and it has yielded strong results in autoregressive models.
Here, we validate that the log-likelihood objective can attain competitive sample quality through a
human evaluation.
In diffusion models, the log-likelihood bound is an expectation over noise levels of a reconstruction
loss weighted by a specific function of the noise level. In contrast, most prior work on diffusion
models for language [ 21,33] as well as images [ 12,5] use heuristic weight schedules. Motivated
by the intuition that human perception is more sensitive to coarse structure than fine details, these
typically assign more weight to higher noise levels than the likelihood weight schedule.
We train three Plaid models: one with the likelihood weight schedule (“VLB”) and two with heuristic
weight schedules (“Schedule A” and “Schedule B”) which we plot in Appendix A. The models are
trained on a large dataset of short children’s stories which we constructed by finetuning GPT-J [ 34]
on ROCStories [ 27]. Because learning embeddings is only straightforward when training against the
likelihood bound, all models use fixed embeddings obtained from a previously-trained known-good
model.
We repeatedly asked crowdworkers to choose from a pair of model samples, where one sample came
from the likelihood-trained model and the other came from a heuristically-trained model. On average,
crowdworkers preferred the likelihood-trained model over both alternatives: Weighting A’s win rate
was0.449(p= 0.001, 95% CI [0.417,0.482]) and Weighting B’s win rate was 0.457(p= 0.005,
95% CI [0.425,0.490]). Because we only consider two alternative weight schedules, we do not claim
that the likelihood objective yields optimal sample quality, but our results suggest that it performs at
least comparably to other choices.
4.2 Validating algorithmic components
Having validated our likelihood-based approach, we show in this section that each of the algorithmic
components described in Section 3 lead to improved likelihoods in a compute-matched ablation study.
We train Plaid models on OpenWebText2 [ 7] and report their log-likelihood bounds on held-out data
in Table 1. Our reference model (“full method”) is a 16×384Transformer with 28M non-embedding
parameters, trained for 92K steps at batch size 256and sequence length 256, corresponding to
1.12×1018non-embedding FLOPs. For each ablation model, we stay as close to this configuration
as possible while preserving the number of non-embedding FLOPs (we exclude FLOPs from the
embedding and output projections because these become negligible at large scale). We observe
that ablating each of the components described in Section 3 results in a worse log-likelihood. As a
comparison point, we also train a model at half the compute budget ( 5.6×1017FLOPs) by halving
the model size. See Appendix B for more training details.
Finally, as a comparison to prior work, we reimplement CDCD [ 6], train it following the same
configuration, and report its log-likelihood. We follow the authors’ description as faithfully as
possible except for the noise schedule endpoints, embedding dimension, and embedding weight
initialization, which we tune to maximize log-likelihood. We observe in Table 1 that even the
half-compute-budget version of Plaid surpasses our CDCD implementation in likelihood. Note that
CDCD was not developed as a likelihood-based model, and the lack of a public implementation
means that there are most likely differences between our implementation and the original.
5 Scaling laws for Plaid
Having developed an algorithmic framework for diffusion language models, we now study its scaling
properties in order to guide large-scale training of Plaid models. In the case of autoregressive models,
the work of Kaplan et al. [15] demonstrates that model log-likelihoods follow a log-linear scaling
law: across many orders of magnitude, training with more compute predictably improves likelihood.
Using these scaling laws, Kaplan et al. [15] and Hoffmann et al. [13] accurately predict the optimal
model size as a function of the given compute budget across many orders of magnitude. Both results
together enable effective large-scale training. In this section, we experimentally determine them for
Plaid models.

5.1 Methodology
Our main experimental method will be an IsoFLOP analysis [ 13]. We first fix a set of FLOP budgets
{C1, . . . , C K}. For each budget C, we train models with different sizes {NC,1, . . . , N C,M}and
perform a quadratic fit of the loss LtologN. We plot all the data along with quadratic fits in
Appendix C and find that the fits approximate the data well.
The minimum of the quadratic gives us the compute-optimal loss L∗
Cand corresponding model size
N∗
Cfor that budget.
Given the compute-optimal loss L∗
Cifor each FLOP budget Ci, we fit the parameters of a loss scaling
law
min
α,βX
i(log(L∗
Ci)−βlog(Ci)−α)2
which can then be used to predict the compute-optimal loss as L∗(C) =αCβ. We also fit a parameter
scaling law N∗(C)in the same fashion from the model sizes N∗
Ci.
We perform IsoFLOP analyses for both Plaid and autoregressive models in order to compare the
results. We choose compute budgets log-uniformly between 1016and1019FLOPs and corresponding
model sizes heuristically. We choose learning rates using µTransfer [ 35] and batch sizes, weight
decays, and aspect ratios by well-tuned heuristics. When computing FLOPs, we exclude FLOPs
from the embedding layers and output projections. This enables us to use much smaller compute
budgets than Hoffmann et al. [13], but it causes our autoregressive scaling law to differ slightly from
theirs. We consider this acceptable since we are mainly interested in the differences between our
autoregressive and Plaid scaling laws.
5.2 Loss improves predictably with compute
We plot both of our scaling laws in Figure 2. Our first finding is that over many orders of magnitude,
the compute-optimal log-likelihood of Plaid models closely matches a power law function of the
compute. Surprisingly, we find that the slopes of both the autoregressive and diffusion scaling laws
are almost exactly the same. These results validate Plaid’s scalability and suggest that we can obtain
strong improvements by training at larger scale.
Regardless of scale, Plaid models require a constant factor of about 64×more compute to match
their autoregressive equivalents. While this factor is large, our work represents the very first attempt
at efficient diffusion model training and focused engineering effort on constant-factor improvements
to diffusion models may enable them to perform similarly to autoregressive models in the future.

5.3 Compute-optimal training recipe
Our next goal is to understand how to optimally use a given compute budget Cto maximize the
held-out likelihood of a model. Specifically, we must choose between training a large model for
fewer iterations or training a small model for longer. For this, we leverage our parameter scaling law
N∗(C)which predicts the optimal model size given a compute budget.
We plot both of our parameter scaling laws in Figure 3 and again find that the trends have nearly the
same slope but differ by a constant factor. Specifically, compute-optimal Plaid models should be
about 4×smaller (and therefore trained for 4×longer) than compute-optimal autoregressive models.
The large gap in compute-optimal settings suggests that selecting model sizes based on existing
scaling laws [ 15,13], which were developed for autoregressive models, could incur a substantial loss
in the effective compute budget.
6 Plaid 1B
To demonstrate the scalability of Plaid models and achieve our goal of outperforming an autoregressive
model in likelihoods, we train, evaluate, and release a large Plaid model called Plaid 1B. Plaid 1B is a
Transformer-based Plaid model with 1.3B parameters, trained for 314B tokens on OpenWebText2 [ 7].
In total, Plaid 1B was trained for 2.5×1021FLOPs, which to our knowledge equals the largest
purely diffusion-based language model trained in prior work [ 6]. We give further training details in
Appendix B.
6.1 Likelihood evaluation
We evaluate Plaid 1B’s likelihood in a zero-shot setting on a suite of six benchmark datasets orig-
inally used in Radford et al. [29]: Penn Treebank [ 25], enwik8 and text8 [ 14], WikiText2 and
WikiText103 [26], and the One Billion Word corpus [2].

autoregressive model, Plaid doesn’t support sliding-window likelihood evaluations, so we use non-
overlapping 1024-token sequences2when computing likelihoods. Following Radford et al. [29],
we use heuristic invertible detokenizers for PTB, 1BW, and WikiText to minimize the effect of
tokenization artifacts on the perplexity results. For a fair comparison, we also recompute GPT-2
likelihoods using the same protocol, resulting in different numbers than Radford et al. [29].
In Table 2 we observe that Plaid 1B consistently outperforms the 124M parameter GPT-2 model,
demonstrating that diffusion models are capable of scaling to perplexities on par with a small modern
autoregressive model.
6.2 Unconditional samples
We generate from Plaid 1B by starting from z1∼ N(0, σ2(1)I), performing ancestral sampling of
p(zt−(1/T)|zt)forT= 4096 steps, and finally arg max pθ(x|z0). Following Dieleman et al. [6],
we sample using a score temperature ofτ= 0.9, which in our formulation corresponds to adding
1−τ
τ(ˆxθ(zt)−zt)toˆxθ(zt)at each step.
We generate unconditional samples with sequence length 1024 and present chosen samples in Table 3.
We observe that the model is capable of generating fluent text and remaining on-topic over several
hundred words. We provide random un-picked samples in Appendix D.
6.3 Zero-shot control
Although Plaid models are trained in a purely unconditional fashion, we present a zero-shot control
technique called token guidance which allows us to implement a number of conditioning structures at
generation time. We begin with classifier guidance , a technique which allows diffusion models to
generate samples conditioned on an arbitrary attribute y. Classifier guidance first trains a probabilistic
classifier p(y|zt)ofygiven noisy latents zt, and then biases the diffusion model’s sampling steps by

tokens under the GPT-2 tokenizer.

aguidance term derived from the gradient of the classifier probability ∇ztlogp(y|zt). Now, recall
from Section 3.2 that our denoiser ˆxθ(zt)is parameterized in terms of a model fθ(zt)which learns
the distribution over the token x(i)at each position igiven zt. We can therefore implement many
different conditioning structures via classifier guidance on probabilities derived from fθitself. We
give a few examples:
Conditioning on a span: We perform guidance on the joint probability of the span under the factorial
model p(x(a:b)|zt)∝Qb
i=ap(x(i)|zt), where fθestimates each factor in the product. This lets
us implement prefix completion and infilling as special cases. Lexical constraints: In order to
condition on the presence of a token without specifying its location, we perform guidance on the
token’s probability under the unigram distribution p(x(any)|zt)∝P
ip(x(i)|zt), where fθestimates
each term in the sum. Token-level weights: We can emphasize a specific conditioning token by
multiplying the corresponding guidance term by a scalar weight. Negation: We condition on the
negation of an attribute yby performing guidance on the complement probability 1−p(y|zt).
Using Plaid 1B and token guidance, we generate samples under various zero-shot control settings.
We present chosen samples in Table 4 and random samples in Appendix D. Despite being trained
unconditionally, Plaid 1B is able to follow diverse conditioning structures.
7 Related work
We contribute to a growing body of work on diffusion-based language models [ 21,3,9,33,10,6,
8,24,37,23,36,11]. Our biggest departure from those works is that we aim for strong likelihood
performance, which to our knowledge has not been attempted in any prior work except for an appendix
result from Li et al. [21]. We therefore benchmark against well-known autoregressive models instead
of prior diffusion language models.
The work most comparable to ours is CDCD [ 6], which is also a strong general-purpose diffusion
language model. However, without the ability to use standard likelihood-based benchmarks [ 25,
14,26], it is difficult to say precisely where CDCD stands in comparison to autoregressive models:
in every result, either CDCD underperforms the autoregressive baseline, or the evaluation metric
saturates and lacks the statistical power to distinguish the models. Many of the other works above share
similar difficulties. In contrast, our likelihood-based approach enables unambiguous comparisons to
widely-known models.
Other diffusion language model works consider more constrained settings like controllable generation
[21] or sequence-to-sequence tasks [ 3,9,8,37,23,36], or propose hybrid approaches involving
pretrained autoregressive models [ 24,11]. Particularly, in concurrent work, Han et al. [11] finetune
an OPT 13B [ 38] model into a hybrid model which is autoregressive over 25-token blocks and uses
diffusion within blocks. Compared to their work, we focus on the more general setting of training a
fully diffusion-based language model from scratch.
Finally, our work builds on recent advances in diffusion models for images [ 32,12,30,18,5]. Most
notably, we adopt the framework of Variational Diffusion Models [ 18] and extend it to language
modeling.
8 Conclusion
In this work, we have taken the first steps toward a competitive likelihood-based diffusion language
model. We built Plaid 1B, which matches GPT-2 124M in likelihood by combining several algorithmic
improvements and a scaling law analysis. Our ablations show that maximizing likelihood does not
substantially harm sample quality, and we show samples are fluent in both unconditional and zero-shot
conditional settings. Despite this progress, substantial work remains: Plaid narrows the compute-
efficiency gap between diffusion and autoregressive language models to 64×, and we view this gap
as a tractable and exciting open problem that may be addressed with further research.

B Experiment details
B.1 Dataset
Unless otherwise noted, all models in this work are trained on a subset of OpenWebText2 [ 7] which
we filter to remove documents labeled as non-English. The data is tokenized using a 32K-token BPE
tokenizer which we train on the OpenWebText2 training split.
B.2 Architecture
We use standard pre-activation Transformers models with RMSNorm normalization layers and GeLU
nonlinearities throughout. Unless otherwise noted, all Plaid models have 16 Transformer layers,
which we found to be approximately optimal for our scale. We scale autoregressive model depth
approximately following [20]. For efficiency, our implementation uses FlashAttention [4] and other
fused kernels wherever applicable. We train at sequence length 256 for all experiments except Plaid
1B.
B.3 Optimization
We optimize all models using AdamW with parameter-specific learning rates derived by µTransfer
[35] based on a learning rate of 1.4×10−3at width 256. Each parameter’s weight decay is set to
4×10−5
ηwhere ηis that parameter’s learning rate. We use a linear warmup on the learning rate and
weight decay over the first 2500 steps, followed by a linear decay to zero over training. We train at
batch size 256 for algorithm ablations and 128 for scaling law experiments.
B.4 Plaid 1B Training
We increase the base µTransfer learning rate to 2×10−3(at width 256). The denoiser network is a
Transformer with 24 layers of width 2048 and a vocabulary size of 32K tokens, for a total of 1.3B
parameters. We train for 1.2M steps at batch size 256 and sequence length 1024, for a total of 314B
tokens. All other details are as written above.

tends to create a ripple effect in the economy, and economist Kevin Milligan said it’s probably a
testament to how worn-down the economy and consumers are, particularly at the low end.\n\n“It’s probably due to things
like investment slowing in the natural resource sector, weakness in stock buybacks in the corporate sector,
corporatism. And, of course, (we) have to look at things about what the Bank of Canada is doing, the uncertainty on
the horizon in terms of trade, and the exchange rate, and all of these things tend to pull down the economy,
particularly the low end.” Tweet This\n\n“I think the economy in general has been feeling the squeeze of low credit
rates, (and) especially low mortgage rates,” he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“It’s difficult to be
selling at rates well below their 10-year average, so I think those effects do come back into the economy as well, and
I’d wonder if it’s pulling down consumption and investment activity.”\n\nConsumers and businesses are really looking
for more and more type of stimulus action not just from the Bank of Canada, but from the federal government too, he
added.\n\nHe said they’re not getting a message from Canadians about the state of the economy and he thinks many
people are wondering if they did get that message from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in December.\n\n“I’d be happy for
people to hear a message, and that has to come through,” he said.\n\nDespite the second interest rate hike, Milligan
said there’s reason to think the odds of an interest rate hike have risen from about one-third to about two-thirds in
the first part of next year.\n\n“I would, on balance, expect a sustained number of rate hikes – even a third hike.”
Tweet This\n\nHe said those predictions are becoming more consistent as well, with a reported saying from economist
Chew Ross this week that most economists consider a fourth rate hike a “near certainty” for 2019.\n\nMilligan said
he’s optimistic about the economy in Canada.\n\n“I think we’re probably in the middle of seeing a strong bottom and
picking back up on a strong GDP, and we’re very much into this directional trend for the economy now that we see.”
Tweet This\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“I think we’re on track for a run of three straight years of
zero- to one-per cent of GDP growth, which would be quite strong. And we’re not quite back at an extended
bottom.\n\n“But I think we were probably hitting close to bottom in the recession in 2009, and we’re clearly in that
situation. So at some point, you want to move up, and of course, one reason would be another surge in the
economy.”\n\nAsked if the possibility of a fourth rate hike in 2019 could help business sentiment going into the
federal election, Milligan said heightened expectations are always a good thing.\n\nHe also said there’s more
opportunity for the Bank of Canada to announce some form of monetary policy stimulus following the second interest
rate hike at its next policy meeting, and financial markets around the world would likely rise in response to such a
move.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“But if they’ve absorbed the downside of those rate hikes in other
ways, I’m not convinced that they are their biggest concern in terms of their intentions.”\n\nWith files from

the Association of National Police Officers (ANPO) revealed. Investment in non-police trusts rose by 17% in the same
period.\n\nANPO chief executive Brian Kirk said: "Police officers rightly want to be rewarded for their service, so
they do not have to choose between keeping communities safe and delivering good policing.\n\n"This extra pay enables
police officers to consider new career opportunities, provide support to those most in need and promote social
inclusion."\n\nThe Scottish Government said in 2017 the police service had more than 23,000 officers, a third of whom
were front-line.\n\nThe current pay structure was introduced in the late 1990s to compensate officers in frontline
commands with high crime rates.\n\nScottish Labour Shadow Justice secretary Michael Russell said the fact officers
were getting paid adequately showed "something urgently needs to be done".\n\nHe said: "It’s completely bonkers that
taxpayers would expect to cough up an extra £425 per hour for a police officer’s shift, especially when frontline
staff like health workers, social services, fire and ambulance continue to face regular annual cuts.\n\n"I can hardly
believe ministers continue to grant hugely lucrative contracts, while freezing its core wages, to a health service
which is already struggling as a result of huge budget cuts, and which the SNP has consistently opened up as a no-go
zone over the last four years.\n\n"Why have ministers allowed higher officer salaries in the police while they have
delivered a decade of devastating budget cuts to the NHS?"\n\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie
said: "It is notable that there has been a significant improvement to current pay arrangements in relation to cover
officer roles.\n\n"However, any rise in pay for the workforce would also need to be brought in line with the huge
cuts we have already seen in frontline services.\n\n"The Scottish Government showed how they last week awarded
zero-cost contracts for labour companies without even looking at what the work cost, and the clear message is that
they are keen on making frontline organisations look more modest rather than worrying about budget cuts.\n\n"There
will be more of the usual bonuses coming before the Government shows how finance and good colleagues will be putting
a concerted effort together to find some resources to offset some of these increased costs, instead of deciding the
way to save the workforce is a cutters field."\n\nNicola Rowland, the general secretary of the RNQ, said: "Front line
firefighters and police officers are asked to endure some of the most distressing things on a daily basis."\n\nThe
average police officer pay rose to £43,085 in 2019, after a two-year increase, the ANPO said.\n\nThe rise in law
enforcement is seen to have been caused by an ageing population and the overseas population and the deepening of
recent job cuts in the Scottish public sector.<|endoftext|>PASADENA, Calif. (KABC) -- A 17-month-old girl

nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. On his yearbook page was a subtote entitled “Don’t Let Them
F***** Your Body Forever,” a reference to the oral contrace
of carbon emissions needed to meet the 2 degree Celsius target set forth in the last assessment of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013. New research rolled out at an annual scientist meeting finds
that the industry will need to recover between 4,000 and 10,000 tons every year of fracked and produced oil and gas
fossil reserves in order to do that, according to an analysis done by lead author Dr. Ernesto Monteiro of the
University of Alberta in Canada.\n\nThe eye-watering figure represents the total amount of oil and gas — shale and
natural gas produced, extracted and sold — will likely need to be recovered in coming years to meet the carbon
mitigation goals. The amount where between 4,000 and 10,000 metric tons of reserves for every 10 metric tons of carbon
dioxide they displaced.\n\n“The benefits of carbon capture increase with the amount being injected,” Monteiro wrote in
an article accepted to publish in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences which DeSmog obtained last
week.\n\nWhile the theoretical ability to limit 2 C warming with fossil fuel carbon budgets is obvious, such action is
not taken by the oil and gas industry. Industry groups led by RRC openly seek to capture 38 million tons of carbon
dioxide emissions annually from operating reserves and transfer a portion of that back to the oil industry as
revenues. “Comparing natural gas reserves under production with proven oil reserves remaining reveals one potential
implication, which is the additional natural gas production that would be required to fully satisfy the 2100 oil
supply balance,” the paper explained. By Monteiro’s estimates, natural gas production will grow by the equivalent of
about 4 Gb per year by 2100, while at the same time oil production will decline at about 1 Gb per year, or a total of
2.66 Gb per year in balance. If all the resources at hand could be extracted, of which no amount is available at all
times, it would be practical to use all of that fossil fuel along with existing operating wells. But as natural gas
production rises, new wells could replace declining oil production with an equivalent number of fossil fuels to
reserves.\n\nCarbon reductions at any level involve “costs” — additional expenditures that necessarily arise from oil
and gas extraction and associated energy production, including physical production, liquefaction capability, handling
and shipping fees. The research found oil and gas companies bid to recover as much natural gas as possible at all
early stages of exploration and production. Natural gas, while more profitable, is much riskier than coal. The paper
explains: “Extracting and producing natural gas exploits the time, location and physical composition of the fossil
record. Each well represents a different geological formation with different natural gas characteristics. These
characteristics mean that the amount of natural gas recovered from a well is not determinative of the productivity of
the well from which it is extracted. Reference reserves provide an indication of the natural gas resources that may
exist in different shale formations and the potential of these resources based on past and future discoveries.”\n\nThe
only kind of geomorphological formation that can be considered very promising for oil and gas production are mesopolar
formations, those within one mile from surface to three miles below ground. Mesopolar formations are generally
regarded as more inflexible than permafrost or acid shale formations, less stable than other subsurface formations or
fracked tight rock, more susceptible to seepage, and more susceptible to oil production costs. For these reasons, the
reserve estimate put out at the annual meeting does not consider natural gas production to be an economic viability
from existing mesopoint formations.\n\nThe net result is that the industry will lose out on billions of dollars in
revenues to pay part of the cost of carbon sequestering, underground scrubber systems and other forms of carbon
capture from any new natural gas reserves of coming years. In order to fuel plants, the primary gas is oxygen; when
undertaking oil and gas production and development that oxygen is extracted from the air and converted into methane
that is vented through rock. It then is dispersed at the surface using various methods, such as proximity to carbon
sequestration facilities and underground scrubber systems, to provide the chance to store carbon dioxide that would
otherwise have been leaked back into the atmosphere.\n\nIn 2014, a team of scientists from the National Academies of
Sciences calculated that deferring as many as 3000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted from oil and gas reserves
already on Earth to new ones would come at a cost of 5 cents annually to the oil industry per ton. Revenues would then
be about \$35-60 billion. “Financials indicate that nonconventional expenditures, including relatively large ones,
will have a material net impact on industry and substantial constrains on operating income and free cash flow,” the

impeachment, McConnell announced that “we have the votes to convict the president.”\n\nTrump also held a rally, in
which he decried the process as “an illegal coup against me,” and announced that he would “appeal.” The rally seemed to
show that the fight wasn’t over.\n\nWATCH:\n\n“This is not a tragedy,” McConnell said in a statement at the time. “I am
convinced, with every fiber of my being, that the President is innocent. Having solicited the articles of impeachment
from the House, the Senate looks forward to hearing from House managers on the charges and then moving forward to
presenting a case for trial by the full Senate.”\n\nTrump’s GOP rivals and independent senators like Sen. Lisa
Murkowski (R-AK) have publicly supported impeaching the president, while other GOP senators, like Sen. Susan Collins
(R-ME) have openly said they could resign.\n\nThe first major impeachment defection came on Sunday when longshot Rep.
Justin Amash (R-MI) announced his intention to convict. In an email to his colleagues, Amash Jr., who criticized
Trump’s actions in the months leading to and through the impeachment, said he was voting to convict.\n\n“From where I
sit, the evidence is overwhelming. As I am a member of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, I have a duty to the
American people, as well as an obligation to my constituents and all who sent me to office, to vote convict,” Amash
said.\n\n<|endoftext|>The Barcelona Golf Course doesn’t look like a golf course, but it is an oasis for
gardening in this busy city.\n\nIt’s a massive course spread over 120 acres with fairways that are split right down the
middle, unlike the designs on most golf courses. The course enjoys the stunning view of the skyline above it.\n\nA
giant oak tree almost 40 meters in diameter serves as one main highlight to the golf course’s design. The course’s
6,486 holes - some six times downhill - are a real treat for newbies and even seasoned golfers.\n\nArcadia for 120
acres was built around Gillet Park Golf Club, an exclusive private mixed-use development. Vergara Andreana’s team
served as the architect for the golf course, with the course designed by 110 Architecture, the local firm working
exclusively with Barca, the city’s Professional Football club.\n\nEven though Andreana is the lead architect on the
project, the team was tasked with creating other lifelines around the course as well as the concrete facade. Aside from
the course, Vergara and Andreana have been involved with at least 20 different, publicly developed projects in
Barcelona.\n\n"Design has to be sustainable"\n\nVergara and Andreana became aware of the Barcelona Golf Course while
participating in an environmental conference. They recalled being surprised by the site’s design, which helped to
heighten their enthusiasm for the project. “Because we are architects, architecture has to be sustainable, either low
energy or low/zero carbon,” Andreana says. “We also want challenges for new projects.”\n\nVergara and Andreana started
in landscape architecture in 1995. At the time, they were involved with relatively small projects located in the
tourism sector. Elsewhere, Vergara and Andreana were searching for a community garden to allow families and people to
experience the magic of nature exploration and gardening.\n\n“We are a architect’s team and we want to improve the
urban environment for our users,” Andreana says.\n\nThe team began to look for a place to design a nine-hole golf
course. In June 2013, they found a spare garden filled with lush grass located in a meadow.\n\nA great opportunity for
diversification\n\nAndreana’s team researched other urban golf courses for the right location. In the end, Gillet Park
Golf Club stood out as the best option. Although the natural gardens needed a restoration for their natural
conservation, the size and location of the golf course offered a unique opportunity to beautify and reinvest in the
urban environment.\n\n“Gillet Park Playground met all the criteria,” Vergara and Andreana explain. “It’s not very
specific, suited the golf course, and had all the right vegetation.”\n\nVergara and Andreana spent just nine months
planting thousands of trees in the western corner of Gillet Park, in the neighborhood of Joan Mariscal. The new golf
course is accessible on the area’s busy streets with shops and restaurants, so the community can enjoy all the leisure
activities in the green space.\n\nThe team uprooted the previously existing Pérez Tree, to make room for the new trees
to complement Gillet Park. It was a quick and convenient solution
however it requires two-piece manual construction, which the designer does with great skill.\n\nCuboys does great
detail work, the whole body is mostly to scale, with the obvious exception of the sword guard. His arms and legs are
also well detailed and the model has pretty good proportions. There are still some details that could probably do with
a little more refinement that I didn’t catch, but in general I like the overall look of this model and it really feels
realistic.\n\nAll in all I was quite impressed, the model is put together with great materials, good use of miniatures
and nice detailed details that are really visible.\n\nThis is most definitely another excellent example of modular
construction in action.<|endoftext|>NEW ROWFORD, Conn. — A man with schizophrenia faces charges for

in the famed resort town of Rosengård, Poland. As of now, there have been no injury reports; however, witnesses told
Poland’s TNT radio station that the trunk of the tree stood at least 3.5 meters tall. It was almost completely
blocking the road used to enter the popular ski resort town.\n\nAccording to report, the base of the tree has fallen,
but the abrupt all-round fall still seems a rather odd way for a tree of such nature to fall. Local media speculated
that a branch had come down, but said that "it’s couldn’t be ruled out." Miraculously, there have only been a handful
of injuries, presumably from the rogue trunk.\n\nThe road is still under reconstruction in some areas, and a single
tree of this size and age toppling on any foundation should not do any real damage. It is reported that the tree will
be removed and reburied.\n\nUpdate: Local emergency crews are still being dispatched to deal with the situation.
However, the tree has reportedly now been removed and the road is now open. A supermarket and McDonald’s have already

\n\nAlexandra Firth reports on the association between higher rates of smoking in the adolescent stages and higher
obesity in subsequent stages. Like Ridley, Whitfield concludes that this means “even if you’re at the bottom you’re
one generation away from obesity”.\n\nThis is certainly true, though there are two big problems with it. First, BAME
adults tend to be smoking at much later ages than those in the adolescent stages, on average at a later age of 34.
This means that there is a causal relationship between smoking and poverty that is not present when we control for
poverty or look at controlled factors. The degree of economic segregation, or the factor that *controls* the wealth
gap – household income according to dollar index – is not nearly as strongly correlated with elevated smoking rates
among the lowest part of the income distribution (Harrison and Strauss-Daly, 2006, 48-49). A higher part of the income
distribution tends to have higher smoking rates, so the level of cigarette consumption is in fact correlated with the
degree of economic mobility (though it’s important to note that it is higher status that has the higher rate of
shoplifting). On the other hand, economic mobility does not seem to be correlated with the causal relationship between
smoking in early adulthood and obesity in later adulthood. This means that being at the top of the income distribution
does not necessarily give someone “higher” status, or more privileged.\n\nSecond, even if you control for
socioeconomic status, people who are more likely to have higher rates of smoking in early adulthood tend to have to
higher rates of obesity in later adulthood than those who are less economically privileged, and there’s no way that
one can infer “teens away” from this, seeing as there is no causal relationship between smoking and mobility, and no
threshold beyond the top of the income scale that is exhibiting an upward trajectory.\n\nIt is certainly true that a
greater proportion of BAME adolescents from families with lower incomes are on average less likely to smoke.
Curiously, Whitfield doesn’t mention that socioeconomic mobility differs significantly between different income
groups, so this kind of relationship can’t be replicated. There is no causal relation, but speaking, just because
those at one top of the income scale are more likely to see their kids try cigarettes, does not mean an ongoing
predisposition towards obesity (or even smoking).\n\nEven though it can’t be proven, and just because it sure seems to
incite a fairly clear upward trajectory of mobility for people at the top of the income distribution, Whitfield is
basically saying people who have higher rates of adolescent smoking are poor, and not vice versa. This is another
misinterpretation/misuse of statistics in public health, and a serious stretch for an economic science that is
considered relatively bias-free by its supporters and anti-economists alike.\n\nTaking the long view: When statistical
models have (pertature) interpretations\n\nIn the same interview Whitfield also makes another somewhat questionable
claim, regarding cigarette smoking and childhood obesity. After finding out that there is no significant causal
relationship outside of the early stages with the level of smoking, he said:\n\nPeople are now wondering why you would
try to avoid the early stages if there is so little causal connection. There is always going to be something in there
about healthy early drinking and preventing an artificial transition.\n\nThe simple fact is that statistical models
don’t get to consider a person’s personal interpretations. A model that shows there is no adverse relationship between
smoking and obesity in the young stages does not come close to considering the personal call on the risk of smoking in
the middle stages; if it is harmful for all, what is the benefit? To understand how interpretations like this are
sometimes folded into public health policy I think it’s helpful to understand the science. Statistical models do not
allow people to tease different factors apart, with differentiated trade-offs. Instead, it requires that you take into
account all of the factors, and come up with the best predicted outcome. Even if one of these models has conflicting
statistical data, there is no concept of statistical meta-analysis as we have in the sciences.\n\nFor example,
Whitfield still needs to ask:\n\nif diet is additive, and therefore a lot of people would develop a nicotine habit,
then, why not just go back to a golden age?\n\nIn my view, trying to use statistics to smooth out the science by
ignoring personal interpretations only tells you that he thinks the personal interpretations are important to begin
with. A lot more effort is taken by the personal interpretations than by statistical models, but that’s why the
interpretations are more valuable (to the public and policy makers). The general principle is the same: some
probabilities exist in the real world, some interpretations are valuable, and members of the public can legitimately
base their decisions on the personal interpretations; not the statistical models. We can try to avoid the rich(but the

At the end of consciousness, you enter a shift-beyond consciousness, like, infinite consciousness. You enter an

D.4 Word-level weights: “Let’s talk about law and medicine.” with 5 ×weight on “law”
Let’s talk about law and medicine.\n\n\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Ron Sen, a veteran administrative law judge, points
out that the decision "ignores the fact that the original separation agreement was reached by binding arbitration"
that responded to "the legitimate ethical concerns of the university administration," which is what lies "at the heart
of law and medicine."\n\nSen’s dissent, meanwhile, argues that the final decision to retain school administrators -- a
decision all the interested parties wanted -- was "rational in light of the fact" that the confidentiality agreement
had been in place for years and involved a range of issues already addressed by the university.
Let’s talk about law and medicine. I’ll bet there’s a big difference between law and medicine, yes? Very good. I wrote
that. Medicine is a spiritual practice and basically involves treating another human being. Law is a legal activity
and basically involves signing a piece of paper. Okay. So that sounds like the healthiest way you’ll live your life.

Let’s talk about law and medicine. We just had a new decision the other day that said, in fact, the governor’s request
to declare a national emergency to protect gears and trooper and anthropoptic posts will in fact actually have to be
met on equal footing. What the governor is entitled to is instructing the federal government to fund the relief
activities under the Federal Emergency Management Act. So that means that he could go to the president of the United
States and say, president I’m going to have to declare a state of emergency. Hey, can you pay for it? He also can be
allowed to stand on equal footing with
Let’s talk about law and medicine. They say, “I worry more about regulation than I worry about law.” And I have posed
this question to people across the country, and we actually go through the exercise of asking this question, and then
we have totally distinct versions of law and regulation or law and medicine, totally distinct things. And that

individuals from going to prison for low-level drug offenses and, when convicted, minor offenses.\n\nBefore this

are not mutually exclusive things. It acknowledges there is a role for government and that citizens have
responsibilities to one another. It also reminds the citizenry that they are the true law-makers, and should look
outside government agencies to offer them those responsibilities. And if politicians can restore notions of mutual
trust, citizens can also hold leaders accountable for their actions through the political process.\n\nRestoring trust
in the American justice system may have global consequences as well. China’s push for espionage may become harder as

Let’s talk about law and medicine. In this show, we’re discussing medical care, the relationship
between law and medicine, the use of law and medicine, and more. Medicine, of course, is a scientific process. It’s
the combination of the tools of science that we have available and the knowledge we’ve acquired from being involved in
our natural world on a day by day basis. Law is a process that is generally based on the physical representation of
biological issues in health and disease. There are legal procedures established to punish or convict certain parties
for certain offenses. Society and legal community are involved for court and criminal governance. This kind

nurses and like most health care providers, we recognize that what we do in the emergency room affects patient privacy

concerns like liability and liability.\n\nIn recent years, we’ve seen an increasing discussion about the relationship
between law and medicine, especially as we see the growth of expanded practice based and managed care medicine. Many
providers are concerned with patient privacy, protecting patient rights and facilitating doctor-patient dialogue. This
