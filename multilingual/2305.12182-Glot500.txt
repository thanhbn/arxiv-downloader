Abstract
The NLP community has mainly focused on
scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) ver-
tically, i.e., making them better for about 100
languages. We instead scale LLMs horizon-
tally: we create, through continued pretraining,
Glot500-m , an LLM that covers 511 predom-
inantly low-resource languages. An impor-
tant part of this effort is to collect and clean
Glot500-c , a corpus that covers these 511 lan-
guages and allows us to train Glot500-m . We
evaluateGlot500-m onfivediversetasksacross
these languages. We observe large improve-
ments for both high-resource and low-resource
languages compared to an XLM-R baseline.
Our analysis shows that no single factor ex-
plains the quality of multilingual LLM rep-
resentations. Rather, a combination of fac-
tors determines quality including corpus size,
script, “help” from related languages and the
total capacity of the model. Our work ad-
dresses an important goal of NLP research: we
should not limit NLP to a small fraction of the
world’s languages and instead strive to support
as many languages as possible to bring the ben-
efits of NLP technology to all languages and
cultures. Code,dataandmodelsareavailable

1 Introduction
TheNLPcommunityhasmainlyfocusedonscaling
Large Language Models (LLMs) vertically , i.e.,
deepeningtheirunderstandingofhigh-resourcelan-
guages by scaling up parameters and training data.
While this approach has revolutionized NLP, the
achievementsarelargelylimitedtohigh-resource
languages. Examplesof“vertical”LLMsareGPT3
(Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al.,
2022) and Bloom (BigScience et al., 2022). In this
paper, we create Glot500-m , a model that instead
focuses on scaling multilingual LLMs horizontally ,

ExistingmultilingualLLMssupportonlyabout
100(Conneauetal.,2020)outofthe7000languages
of the world. These supported languages are the
ones for which large amounts of training data are
available through projects such as Oscar (Suárez
et al., 2019) and the Wikipedia dumps.2Following
Siddhantetal.(2022),werefertothe100languages
covered by XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) as head
languages andtotheremaininglanguagesas tail
languages . This terminology is motivated by the
skeweddistribution of availabledata per language:
for the best-resourced languages there are huge
corporaavailable,butforthelongtailoflanguages,
only small corpora exist. This is a key problem we
address: theavailabilityofdatafortaillanguages
is limited compared to head languages. As a result,
tail languages have often been ignored by language
technologies (Joshi et al., 2020).
Although there exists some work on machine
translation for a large number of tail languages
(Costa-jussà et al., 2022; Bapna et al., 2022), ex-
isting LLMs for tail languages are limited to a
relativelysmallnumberoflanguages(Wangetal.,
2019;Alabietal.,2022;Wangetal.,2022). Inthis
paper,weaddressthisgap. Ourworkhasthreeparts.

of tasks.
Inmoredetail, corpuscollection considersthree
major sources: websites thatare knownto publish
content in specific languages, corpora with clas-

in specific tail languages. The resulting dataset
Glot2000-c comprises 700GBin 2266 languages
collected from≈150 sources. After cleaning and

tionofISO639-33andscript)totrain Glot500-m .
Our criterion for including a language-script in
Glot500-c is that it includes more than 30,000 sen-
tences.

XLM-R’s vocabulary is extended with new tokens

pretraining of XLM-R with the MLM objective
(Devlin et al., 2019).
Validation. We comprehensively evaluate

strate that Glot500-m performs better than XLM-
R-B (XLM-R-base) for tail languages by a large
marginwhileperformingcomparably(orbetter)for
head languages.
Previous work on multilinguality has been hin-
dered by the lack of LLMs supporting a large num-
ber of languages. This limitation has led to studies
being conducted in settings dissimilar from real-
worldscenarios. For example,Dufter andSchütze
(2020)usesynthetic languagedata. And thecurse
of multilinguality has been primarily studied for
a set of high-resource languages (Conneau et al.,
2020). By creating Glot500-m , we caninvestigate
these issues in a more realistic setting. We make
code, data and trained models available to foster
research by the community on how to include hun-
dredsoflanguagesthatarecurrentlyill-servedby
NLP technology.

2 Related Work
Training multilingual LLMs using the masked lan-
guage modeling (MLM) objective is effective to
achieve cross-lingual representations (Devlin et al.,
2019; Conneau et al., 2020). These models can be
further improved by incorporating techniques such
asdiscriminativepre-training(Chietal.,2022)and
theuseofparalleldata(Yangetal.,2020;Chietal.,
2021). However, this primarily benefits a limited
set of languages with large corpora.
Recent research has attempted to extend exist-
ing LLMs to languages with limited resources.
Wangetal.(2019)proposevocabularyextension;
EbrahimiandKann(2021)investigateadaptation
methods, including MLM and Translation Lan-
guageModel(TLM)objectivesandadapters;Alabi
etal.(2022)adaptXLM-Rto17Africanlanguages;
Wang et al. (2022) expand language models to
low-resource languages using bilingual lexicons.
Alternatively, parameter-efficient fine-tuning
adapts pre-trained models to new languages by
training a small set of weights effectively (Zhao
etal.,2020;Pfeifferetal.,2021;Anselletal.,2022).
Pfeiffer et al. (2022) address the “curse of multilin-
guality”bysharingapartofthemodelamongall
languagesandhavingseparatemodulesforeachlan-
guage. Weshowthatthecommonperceptionthat
multilingualityincreasesasweaddmorelanguages,
until,fromsomepoint,itstartsdecreasing,isnaive.
The amount of available data per language and the
similarity between languages also play important
roles (§6.8).
Another approach trains LLMs from scratch for
alimitednumberoftaillanguages;e.g.,AfriBERTa

(Oguejietal.,2021a)andIndicNLPSuite(Kakwani

African languages on a 42 GB corpus, but without
making the model available and with an evaluation
on a smaller number of languages than ours.

3.1 Data Collection
One of the major challenges in developing NLP
technologies for tail languages is the scarcity of
high-qualitytrainingdata. Inthiswork,wepropose
a lightweight methodology that is easily replicable
for academic labs. We identify tail language data
previouslypublishedbyresearchers,publishersand
translators and then crawl or download them. By
crawling a few websites and compiling data from
around 150 different datasets, we amass more than
700GBof text in 2266 languages. We will refer
tothesesourcesofdataas datasources . Ourdata
covers many domains, including religious texts,
news articles and scientific papers. Some of the
data sources are high-quality, verified by native
speakers,translatorsandlinguists. Othersareless
reliablesuchaswebcrawlsandWikipediadumps.
It is therefore necessary to clean the data. For alist
of data sources, see §C.3.2 Language-Scripts
Somelanguagesarewritteninmultiplescripts;e.g.,
Tajik is written in both Cyrillic and Arabic scripts.
Some data sources indicate the script, but others
either do not or provide mixed text in multiple
scripts. Wedetect thescriptfor eachsentence and
treat each language-script as a separate entity.

D𝐿𝑖,𝐿𝑗=max PP(𝑀𝑗,𝐿𝑖),PP(𝑀𝑖,𝐿𝑗)
We useDto filter out noisy data in §3.4 and study
theeffectofsimilarlanguagesinLLMtrainingin
§6.7 and §6.8. For more details, see §A.
3.4 Data Cleaning
To remove noise, we use chunk-level and corpus-
level filters.
While some sources are sentence-split, others
provide multiple sentences (e.g., a paragraph) as
onechunk. Chunk-level filtersprocess eachchunk
oftextfromadatasourceasaunit,withoutsentence-
splitting. Some chunk-level filters are based on the
notion of word: we use white space tokenization
whenpossibleandotherwiseresorttosentencePiece
(KudoandRichardson,2018)trainedbyCosta-jussà
et al. (2022).
Aschunk-levelfilters,weemploythe sentence-
level filters SF1–SF5 from BigScience ROOTS
(Laurençon et al., 2022).
SF1Characterrepetition. Iftheratioofrepeated
charactersistoohigh,itislikelythatthesentence
has not enough textual content.
SF2Word repetition. A high ratio of repeated
words indicates non-useful repetitive content.
SF3Special characters. Sentences with a high
ratio of special characters are likely to be crawling
artifacts or computer code.
SF4Insufficientnumberofwords. Sincetraining
language models requires enough context, very
small chunks of text are not useful.
SF5Deduplication. Iftwosentencesareidentical

In the rest of the paper, we refer to a chunk as

segment, a complete sentence or a chunk (i.e.,
several sentences).
Corpus-level filters detect if the corpus of a
language-script is noisy; e.g., the corpus is in an-

tent such as tabular data. We employ filters CF1
and CF2.
CF1In case of mismatch between language
and script , the corpus is removed; e.g., Chinese
written in Arabic is unlikely to be Chinese.
CF2Perplexity mismatch. For each language-
script L1, we find its closest language-script L2:

3.5 Training Data: Glot500-c
Among the 2000+ language-scripts that we col-
lecteddatafor,aftercleaning,mosthavetoolittle
data for pretraining LLMs. It is difficult to quan-
tify the minimum amount needed for pretraining.
Therefore,wepickarelativelyhigh“safe”threshold,
30,000sentences’,forinclusionoflanguage-scripts
inmodeltraining. Thisallowsustotrainthemodel
effectively and cover many low-resource languages.
Table 1 gives Glot500-c statistics. See §B for a
list of language-scripts. We train Glot500-m on
Glot500-c ; note that while Glot500-c focuses on
tail languages, it contains some data in head lan-
guages which we include in Glot500-m training to
prevent catastrophic forgetting.
We divide the corpus for each language into
train/dev/test, reserving 1000 sentences’ each for
dev and test and using the rest for train. We pick

verses convey identical meanings and facilitate
crosslingual evaluation. We pretrain the model

tail languages – head languages are already well
learned by XLM-R. We merge the obtained tokens
with XLM-R’s vocabulary. About 100K new to-
kens were in fact old tokens, i.e., already part of
XLM-R’s vocabulary. We take the probabilities
of the (genuinely) new tokens directly from Sen-
tencePiece. Afteraddingthe151Knewtokensto
XLM-R’s vocabulary (which has size 250K), the
vocabulary size of Glot500-m is 401K.
We could also calculate probabilities of existing
and new tokens over a mixture of original XLM-R
trainingcorpusand Glot500-c (Chungetal.,2020).
For head languages, the percentage of changed
tokens using the new tokenizer compared to the
original tokenizer ranges from 0.2% to 50%. How-
ever, we found no relationship between percentage
of changed tokens and change in performance on
downstream tasks. Thus, there was little effect of
tokenization in our experiments.
4.2 Continued Pretraining
We create Glot500-m by continued pretraining of
XLM-R-B with the MLM objective. The opti-
mizer used is Adam with betas (0.9, 0.999). Initial
learning rate: 5e-5. Each training step contains
a batch of 384 training samples randomly picked
from all language-scripts. The sampling strategy

5 Experimental Setup
For most tail languages, there are no manually
labeledevaluationdata. Wethereforeadoptamixed
evaluationstrategy: basedpartlyonhumanlabels,
partly on evaluation methods that are applicable
to many languages without requiring gold data.
Table 3 lists all our evaluation tasks.
Perplexity Following Salazar et al. (2020), we
calculate pseudoperplexity (PPPL) over the held-
out test set. PPPL is based on masking tokens
one-by-one (not left to right). Salazar et al. (2020)
give evidence that PPPL is a better measure of
linguisticacceptabilitycomparedtostandardleft-
to-right perplexity.
Roundtrip Alignment For assessing the quality
of multilingual representations for a broad range of
taillanguageswithouthumangolddata,weadopt
roundtrip evaluation (Dufter et al., 2018). We first
word-align sentences’ in a parallel corpus based on
themultilingualrepresentationsofanLLM.Wethen
startfromaword 𝑤inasentence’inlanguage-script
L1, follow the alignment links to its translations in
language-scriptL2, thenthealignmentlinksfrom
L2 to L3 and so on, until in the end we follow
alignment links back to L1. If this “roundtrip” gets
us back to𝑤, then it indicates that the LLM has
similar representations for the meaning of 𝑤in
language-scripts L1, L2, L3, etc. In other words,the cross-lingual quality of representations is high.
Viceversa,failuretogetbackto 𝑤isasignofpoor
multilingual representations.
WeuseSimAlign(JaliliSabetetal.,2020)and
alignonthesub-wordlevelontheBiblepartoftest,
based on the representations of the LLM computed
bytransformerlayer8assuggestedintheoriginal
paper. We use intersection symmetrization: each
wordinasentence’isaligned toatmostoneword
in the other sentence’.
As evaluation measurewe compute the percent-
age of roundtrips that were successes, i.e., the
roundtrip starts at 𝑤in L1 and returns back to 𝑤.

L3, L4. Since the intermediate points influence
theresults,weruntheexperimentfivetimeswith
differentintermediatepointsandreporttheaverage.
All models are evaluated with the same five sets of
three intermediate language-scripts.
Sequence Labeling We consider two sequence
labelingtasks: NamedEntityRecognition(NER)
and Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging. We use the
WikiANN dataset (Pan et al., 2017) for NER and
version v2.11 of Universal Dependencies (UD)
(deMarneffeetal.,2021)forPOS.Sincetraining
datadoesnotexistforsomelanguages,wefinetune
on English (with early stopping based on dev) and
evaluatezero-shottransferonalllanguagescovered
by WikiANN/UD. We set the learning rate to 2e-5
with Adam.
SentenceRetrieval Following(Huetal.,2020),
we use up to 1000 English-aligned sentences’ from
Tatoeba(ArtetxeandSchwenk,2019)toevaluate
SentRetr (sentence retrieval). We also use 500
English-alignedsentences’fromtheBiblepartof

ilarity based on the average word embeddings in

6 Experiments
In this section, we discuss aggregate results. For
detailed results, see §D and §E.
6.1 Results
Table 4 gives results. Glot500-m outperforms
XLM-R-B on all tasks for both head and tail
language-scripts, except for POS on head. That
Glot500-m outperforms XLM-R-Bis expected for
tail language-scripts (i.e., those not covered by
XLM-R).Fortheselanguage-scriptstheimprove-
ment margin is large. Outperformance may seem
counterintuitive for head language-scripts (those
coveredbyXLM-R)since Glot500-m hasthesame
numberof(non-embedding)parametersasXLM-
R-B. Since the number of covered languages has
greatly increased, leaving less capacity per lan-
guage,wemightexpectunderperformance. There
areafewpossibleexplanations. First,XLM-Rmay
be undertrained, and the inclusion of more head
language training data may improve their repre-
sentations. Second, having more languages may
improvemultilingualitybyallowinglanguagesto
synergize and enhance each other’s representations
and cross-lingual transfer. Third, there are lan-
guages similar to head languages among the tail
languages, which in turn aids head languages.
The gap between Glot500-m and the baselines
for tail language-scripts in sequence labeling is
smaller. These tasks do not require as deep an
understandingoflanguageandthustransferfrom
headtotaillanguage-scriptsiseasierthroughshared
tokens.
Glot500-m also outperforms XLM-R-L for tail
language-scripts (all tasks) and head language-
scripts (3 tasks). This suggests that scaling up
size is not the only way for improvements. We can
alsoimprovethequalityofmultilingualLLMrepre-
sentations by increasing the number of languages.
6.2 Language Coverage
Table 5 compares Glot500-m vs. XLM-R-B on
pseudoperplexity. For fair comparison we use
word-level normalization. For 69 head language-
scripts,Glot500-m underperformsXLM-R-B.This
is expected as Glot500-m ’s training data is small
fortheselanguage-scripts. Glot500-m outperforms
XLM-R-B for 420 tail language-scripts.
There are eight tail language-scripts for which

provement is fast in the beginning for tail languages,
then gets slower and and reaches a plateau. This pattern
is partially observed for head languages.
Glot500-m performs worse than XLM-R-B. Five
are tail languages with a similar head lan-
guage where the two share a macro-language:
ekk/Standard Estonian (est/Estonian), aln/Gheg

The other three languages all have a unique
script: sat/Santali (Ol Chiki script), div/Dhivehi
(Thaanascript),iku/Inuktitut(Inuktitutsyllabics).
For these languages, XLM-R-B’s tokenizer returns
many UNK tokens since it is not trained on these
scripts,resultinginanunreasonablyoptimisticesti-

ity could be related to the fact that they are tonal
languages, but the tones are not orthographically
indicated. Another possible explanation is that
the training data is dominated by one subcorpus
(Jehova’sWitnesses)whereasthetestdataaredom-
inated by PBC. There are orthographic differences
betweenthetwo,e.g.,“dong”(JW)vs.“doŋ”(PBC)
for Acoli. These three languages are also spoken
overalargeareaincountrieswithdifferentstandard
languages, which could increase variability.
Our analysis is not conclusive. We note however
that the gap between the three languages and the
nextmostdifficultlanguagesintermsofpseudop-
erplexity is not large. So maybe Luo, Acoli and
Teso are simply (for reasons still to be determined)
languages that have higher perplexity than others.
6.3 Training Progression
To analyze the training process, we evaluate
Glot500-m on sequence labeling and SentRetr at
10,000-step intervals. Figure 1 shows that perfor-
manceimprovesrapidlyattheonsetoftraining,but
then the rate of improvement slows down. This
trendisparticularlypronouncedfortaillanguagesin
SentRetr. In comparison, sequence labeling is rela-
tivelystraightforward,withthebaseline(XLM-R-B,
epoch0)achievinghighperformancebycorrectly
transferringprevalentclassessuchas verbandnounthrough shared vocabulary, resulting in a smaller
improvement of Glot500-m vs. XLM-R-B.
For SentRetr, we observe larger improvements
for the Bible than for Tatoeba. This is likely due to
thehigherproportionofreligiousdatain Glot500-c ,
compared to XLM-R’s training data (i.e., CC100).

6.4 Analysis across Language-Scripts
To analyze the effect of language-scripts, we select
fivetaillanguage-scripts eachwiththelargestand
smallestgainwhencomparing Glot500-m vs.XLM-
R-B for SentRetr and sequence labeling.
Table 6 shows that Glot500-m improves lan-
guages with scripts not covered by XLM-R (e.g.,
div/Dhivehi, Thaana script, see §6.2) by a large
marginsinceXLM-Rsimplyregardstheuncovered
scripts as unknown tokens and cannot compute
meaningful representations for the input. The large
amount of data we collected in Glot500-c also
contributestotheimprovementfortaillanguages,
e.g., for tat_Cyrl (Tatar) in SentRetr Tatoeba and
mlt_Latn (Maltese) in POS. See §6.7 for a detailed
analysis of the effect of corpus size.
Ontheotherhand, Glot500-m achievesjustcom-
parable or even worse results for some language-
scripts. We see at least three explanations. (i)
As discussed in §6.2, some tail languages (e.g.,
nob/Norwegian Bokmal) are close to a head lan-
guage (e.g., nor/Norwegian), so Glot500-m has no
advantage over XLM-R-B. (ii) A language is at the
lowendofourcorpussizerange(i.e.,30,000sen-
tences’). Example: xav_Latn, Xavánte. (iii) Some
languages are completely distinct from all other
languages in Glot500-c , thus without support from
any similar language. An example is mau_Latn,
Huautla Mazatec. Glot500-m has a much harder

6.7 Effect of Amount of Training Data
Weexaminecorrelationbetweenpretrainingcorpus
size andGlot500-m zero-shot performance. We
focusonSentRetrBible(§5)sinceitsupportsthe
mostheadandtaillanguages. WefindthatPearson’s
𝑟=.34, i.e., corpus size and performance are
moderately, but clearly correlated. We suspect that
the correlation is not larger because, in addition
to corpus size of language 𝑙itself, corpus size of
languagescloselyrelatedto 𝑙isalsoanimportant
factor(see§6.4forasimilarfindingforNorwegian).
We thereforealso compute Pearson’s 𝑟between (i)
performanceoflanguage 𝑙onSentRetrBibleand
(ii)jointcorpussizeof 𝑙andits𝑘nearestneighbors
(accordingtoperplexitydivergence,§3.3). Inthis
case,Pearson’s 𝑟=.44(forboth𝑘=3and𝑘=4),

languages does play a role.6.8 Support through Related Languages
Buildingon§6.7,thereisanotherwaywecaninves-
tigatethepositiveeffectofcloselyrelatedlanguages
on performance: We can compare performance
(again on SentRetr Bible) of continued pretraining
on just one language (we refer to this model as
Glot+1) vs. on all 511 languages represented in
Glot500-c (i.e.,Glot500-m ). Table 9 presents re-
sults for six language-scripts selected from various
languagefamiliesandsuggeststhatsomelanguages
do not receive support from related languages (top
three). In that case, Glot+1 can fully concentrate
on learning the isolated language and does better
thanGlot500-c . Other languages (bottom three)
do receive support from related languages. For
example,SouthernQuechua(quh)seemstoreceive
supportin Glot500-m fromcloselyrelatedCuzco

ing Glot+1.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
Wecollectanddata-clean Glot500-c ,alargecorpus
ofhundredsofusuallyneglectedtail(i.e.,long-tail)
languages and create Glot500-m , an LLM that is
trained on Glot500-c and covers these languages.
We evaluate Glot500-m on six tasks that allow us
to evaluate almost all languages. We observe large
improvementsforbothheadandtaillanguagescom-
paredtoXLM-R.Ouranalysisshowsthatnosingle
factor fully explains the quality of the representa-
tion of a language in a multilingual model. Rather,
a combination of factors is important, including
corpussize,script,“help”fromrelatedlanguages
and the total capacity of the model.
This work is the first to create a language model
on a dataset of several hundreds of gigabytes and
tomakeitpubliclyavailableforsuchalargeanddi-
verse number of low-resource languages. In future
research, we would like to train larger models to
further investigate the effect of model size, distill
highly multilingual models for resource-efficient
deployment, explore alternatives to continuedpre-
training and use models for more tail language
downstream tasks.
Limitations
(1) We did not perform any comprehensive hy-
perparameter search, which would have further
consolidatedourresults. Thisdecisionwasmade
duetothehighcostoftrainingmultiplemodels. (2)
Comparedtocurrentverylargemodels, Glot500-m

--- PAGE 10 ---
is comparatively small. (3) Although we have tried
to minimize the amount of noise in our data, some
noise is still present.
Ethics Statement
Therearetwoissuesworthmentioninginregards
to this project. First, it was not feasible for us
to thoroughly examine the content of the data for
alllanguages,thuswecannotconfirmtheabsence
ofdiscriminationbasedonfactorssuchasraceor

asanendorsementbyourteam. Ifthemodelissub-
sequently utilized for generation, it is possible that

how well a trained language model on language 𝐿1
predicts the test text of language 𝐿2and vice-versa.
Thedivergencebetweentwolanguagesiscomputed
with the maximum of the perplexity values in both
directions. Two reasons lead to the use of max:
first, a symmetrical divergence is required, and
second, languages differ in their complexity, so
one direction of computing perplexity may result
in a much lower perplexity than another. Thus,
comparing perplexity results becomes difficult. As
anexample,theKuanualanguage(ksd_Latn)has
short words and a simple structure, which results
in3−gram models getting lower perplexity on its
text compared to other languages. The lower the
perplexitythesmallerthedivergencebetweenlan-

Runs and Data. The data used to train and test
the character level n-gram models is the same data
usedforthetrainingandtestingofthe Glot500-m .
The training of the models was limited to 100,000
sentences’ per language-script. We use KenLM
library (Heafield, 2011) to build n-gram models.
Thislibrary usesaninterpolated modifiedKneser-
Ney smoothing for estimating the unseen n-grams.

BaselineandEvaluation. Languagefamilytrees
were used as a baseline for evaluating the diver-
gence measures of the proposed approach. We
obtained language family tree data from Ethno-
logue online version (Eberhard et al., 2022). Foreachlanguage,thefamilytreefollowsthegeneralor-
der from largest typological language family group
tosmallest. Thereisonlyonefamilytreeforeach
language inthe baseline data. Nodesin the family
treerepresenttypologicallanguagefamilygroups.
Each node only has one parent, so if a node is
common in the family tree of two languages, its
parent is also common. We evaluate our perplex-
ity method on the following binary classification
task: Do the majority of a language 𝐿𝑧’s𝑘nearest
neighbors belong to the same typological language
family group as 𝐿𝑧? Assuming languages 𝐿𝑖and
𝐿𝑗, with the following family trees:
𝑇𝐿𝑖:1→2→3→4→5→6
𝑇𝐿𝑗:1→2→7→8
These2languagesbelongtothesametypological
family group with family tree levels of 𝑙∈{1,2},
but not with family tree levels of 𝑙=3and higher.
Result.When it comes to language families, the
majority of studies only refer to the largest typo-
logicallanguagefamilygroup(level 𝑙=1). Here,
we also assess our methodology for other levels.
The results of classification accuracy for 3−gram
model,𝑘∈{1,3,7,13,21}and𝑙∈{1,2,3,max}
areshowninTable10. Incaseswherethemaximum
level of a tree is less than the 𝑙parameter, the max-
imum level for that language is used. Languages
without a family or no other family member in our
data are excluded. We only report the 3−gram
model results as it gets the best results in most
configurationsamongothern-grammodels. With
increasing𝑙, the accuracy decreases, since more
languages fall outsidethe same typological family.
As𝑘increases,theaccuracydecreases,becauselan-

are times when languages have a lot of loan words

guage: aym_Latn)andQuechua(Macrolanguage:

and influence on each other, but they do not belong
to the same typological group. As well, some of
the typological families are not that large, which
makes our results worse when 𝑘increases. This is

B Languages
The list of languages used to train Glot500-m with
the amount of available data for each language is
available in Tables 11, 12 and 13.
OnMacrolanguages Thepresenceoflanguage
codes that are supersets of other language codes
within datasets is not uncommon (Kreutzer et al.,
2022). This issue becomes more prevalent in ex-
tensivecollections. Within theISO639-3standard,
these languages are referred to as macrolanguages.
When confronted with macrolanguages, if it is not
feasibletoascertainthespecificindividuallanguage
containedwithinadataset,themacrolanguagecode
is retained. Consequently, it is possible that in
Glot2000-c andGlot500-c both the corpora for the
macrolanguage and its individual languages have
been included.C List of data sources
