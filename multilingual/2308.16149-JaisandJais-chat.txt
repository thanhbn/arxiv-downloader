Abstract
We introduce JaisandJais-chat , new state-of-the-art Arabic-centric foundation and instruction-tuned open
generative large language models (LLMs). The models are based on the GPT-3 decoder-only architecture
and are pretrained on a mixture of Arabic and English texts, including source code in various programming
languages. With 13 billion parameters, they demonstrate better knowledge and reasoning capabilities in Arabic
than any existing open Arabic and multilingual models by a sizable margin, based on extensive evaluation.
Moreover, the models are competitive in English compared to English-centric open models of similar size,
despite being trained on much less English data. We provide a detailed description of the training, the tuning,
the safety alignment, and the evaluation of the models. We release two open versions of the model —the
foundation Jais model, and an instruction-tuned Jais-chat variant— with the aim of promoting research on
Arabic LLMs.
This paper contains examples that may be offensive or triggering to some audiences.

1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), demon-
strating remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality texts and resulting in widespread adoption across a
diverse array of practical NLP applications and domains. Yet, the main focus of research and development ef-
forts so far has been on English. While recent LLMs such as Falcon [AAA+23], PALM [CND+22] and LLaMA
[TLI+23, TMS+23], among others, are able to process data in multiple languages, they were nevertheless pri-
marily trained and instruction-tuned for English. As a result, they are not able to extend their understanding
and generation capabilities to languages other than English. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap. We focus
on Arabic, one of the world’s most spoken languages with over 400M speakers, which has been noticeably un-
derrepresented in the LLM space so far. In particular, we develop Jais, a powerful Arabic-centric decoder-only
LLM with 13B parameters, based on the GPT-3 generative pretraining architecture [BMR+20].
The primary challenge in developing an Arabic LLM is the limited availability of high-quality Arabic data.
As compared to English, where corpora of size up to two trillion tokens are readily available [TMS+23], Arabic
corpora are significantly smaller in size. As part of this work, we have collected the largest Arabic corpora
to date, consisting of 72 billion tokens. However, this dataset is still not sufficiently large for the purposes of
training an Arabic LLM capable of demonstrating emergent capabilities [Ope23].
To address this, we train bilingual models, by augmenting the limited Arabic pretraining data with abundant
English pretraining data. We pretrain Jais on 395 billion tokens, including 72 billion Arabic tokens (which
we repeat 1.6 times, to obtain an effective total of 116 billion Arabic tokens), 232 billion English tokens, and
the remainder being code in various programming languages. As part of our effort, we have designed and
developed a specialized Arabic text processing pipeline that includes thorough data filtering and cleaning to
produce high-quality Arabic data.
Unlike previous massively multilingual LLMs such as BLOOM [SFA+23] or mT0 [MWS+23], which con-
tain more than 50 languages, we do not include languages aside from Arabic and English in any significant
percentage. Neither do we relegate Arabic to a minority in the pretraining dataset. Instead, Arabic data con-
stitutes 33% of our pretraining. Our choice of mixing two languages attains the best of both worlds; the LLM
is highly fluent in Arabic, with linguistic capability as well as cultural awareness and sensitivity. At the same
time, it is on par with recent English LLMs in terms of reasoning capacity and world knowledge, capabilities
we observe to have transferred from English to Arabic and vice-versa.
Building upon the standard transformer architecture [VUWS22] in the form of its GPT-3 variant, we adopt
a number of improvements from the literature including ( i) ALiBi [PSL22] positional encodings, which enable
the model to extrapolate to longer contexts at inference, ( ii) SwiGLU activation function [Sha20] to improve
the performance, ( iii) maximal update parametrization to perform hyperparameter optimization based on exper-
iments with smaller models [YHB+21], and ( iv) a custom-built tokenizer that weighs both languages equally.
We further develop an instruction-tuned version of our model, Jais-chat , which uses over 3.6 million Arabic
and 6 million English instruction-response pairs. Considering the inherent safety concerns of LLMs, we further
fine-tune it with safety-oriented instructions. In our deployed system which provides an interactive interface to
the instruction-tuned model1, we add extra guardrails in the form of safety prompts, keyword-based filtering,
and external classifiers. An example conversation with Jais-chat on this interface is shown in Figure 1.
We evaluate Jais andJais-chat across a wide array of Arabic and English NLP benchmarks, addressing
reasoning, knowledge, misinformation, and bias. The results show that Jaisis superior in Arabic compared to
other models of similar size, while also being competitive in English, despite being trained on significantly less
English data.
We are releasing the following models:
•Jais2: base pretrained 13B foundation model;
•Jais-chat3: instruction-tuned 13B version of Jais, optimized for dialog interaction.
By making our models publicly available, we hope to enable further research and development in this area,
stimulating innovation and practical applications that can better serve the Arabic and the global communities.
Despite our significant efforts to ensure safety, we recognize that the models are not foolproof and may not
cover all cases. Therefore, we strongly urge all adopters to exercise caution and to conduct additional safety
testing before deploying our models. For this purpose, we outline responsible release notes in Section 9.

2 Pretraining Data
We pretrain the LLM on hundreds of billions of words of diverse text from a variety of sources in order to
develop a strong foundation in the target language(s) while at the same time establishing a broad factual knowl-
edge base in the model. In settings such as clinical domains, research has shown that larger-scale LLMs exhibit
improved emergent capabilities [SAT+22]. Note that LLMs such as LLaMA [TLI+23] and Falcon [AAA+23]
are predominantly trained on a single language: English. While these models exhibit impressive linguistic
and reasoning capabilities, their abilities do not extend so well to other languages such as Arabic, as we will
demonstrate experimentally below.

Table 1: Composition and breakdown of our Arabic pretraining dataset (without translation).
Moreover, the extent of knowledge of Arabic world embedded in these models is limited, as they only
include relatively small amounts of native Arabic text. To tackle this challenge, we pretrain our model with the
largest Arabic dataset in the world, while further extending it with English data and some programming code,
to improve the logical reasoning abilities of the model.
Our pretraining data mix is 1:2:0.4 for Arabic:English:code. We arrived at this ratio through extensive
experiments on smaller models, which we describe in Section 3. We base this mix on all of the available Arabic
data, as this is the smallest of the three data sources.
We collect our Arabic training data from multiple sources including web pages, Wikipedia articles, news
articles, Arabic books, and social network content. To augment the dataset, we also translate English content to
Arabic using an in-house machine translation system.4We restrict this to high-quality English resources such as
the English Wikipedia and English books. We apply checks to avoid translating English sources with embedded
code, or text that is not well structured.
A breakdown of the Arabic dataset (except the translated content) is detailed in Table 1. Specifically, we
use text from the following sources:
•Abu El-Khair : a collection of more than five million news articles, collected from ten major news sources
of Arabic countries over a period of fourteen years [AEK16].
•Aranews : Arabic news corpus from multiple sources ranging from year 2005-2022 [GEQ12]
•ArabicText 2022 : an open-source Arabic collection5prepared by the Beijing Academy of Artificial
Intelligence (BAAI), that includes Arabic text corpora such as ArabicWeb22-A, ArabicWeb16 [SKF+16],
OSCAR6, ArabicWeb22-B, CC100-AR [CKG+20], and Arabic Tweets.
•Arabic subset of C4 : a cleaned version of the Common Crawl using the cleaning and the filtering de-
scribed in [RSR+20]. We use the Arabic subset of this corpus.
•Arabic Wikipedia : Wikipedia written in Arabic7
•ArabicNews 2020 : an in-house news crawl at Inception of various Arabic news channels.
4Our in-house translation system is a standard transformer sequence-to-sequence model implemented in the FairSeq library [OEB+19]
and trained on public datasets available in OPUS [Tie12]. The English to Arabic translation performance is 31 and 40 BLEU points
[PRWZ02] on Flores-101 and a held-out test dataset, respectively.

•Maktabah : a corpus of approximately 6,500 Arabic books.8
•UN Meeting transcripts : the United Nations Parallel Corpus,9v1.0 [ZJDP16] which is available in the
six official languages of the United Nations, of which we use the Arabic documents.
•Other Sources : a combined dataset of multiple smaller corpora including poetry, news, entertainment,
sports, and management documents.10
We further augment the Arabic data by translating 3B tokens from English Wikipedia and 15B tokens from
the Books3 corpus. As a result, we increase the Arabic data from 55B to 72B tokens. Subsequently, we
upsample this Arabic data 1.6 times, obtaining 116B Arabic tokens.
For English, we use The Pile [GBB+20], a collection of 22 high-quality datasets, from which we randomly
sample 232B English tokens and 46B tokens from its GitHub subset. Table 2 shows details about the English
data we use. Specifically, we use text from the following sources, part of The Pile:
•Pile-CC : A subset of The Pile dataset, derived from the Common Crawl, a collection of website crawls
from 2008 onwards. The dataset includes raw web pages, metadata, and text extractions from diverse
domains. Due to the varying quality of the data in Common Crawl, Pile-CC is created using jusText
[EN13] on Web Archive files for extraction, yielding higher quality output than directly using the WET
files [GBB+20].
•Books3 : Derived from the contents of the Bibliotik private tracker made available by Shawn Presser
[Pre20]. It is a mix of fiction and non-fiction books, significantly larger than the next largest dataset,
BookCorpus2, and was included for its value in long-range context modeling and coherent storytelling.
•ArXiv : A subset of the ArXiv preprint repository for research papers, which has been in operation since
1991.11
•PubMed Central : A subset of the PubMed online repository for biomedical articles, managed by the
United States’ National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).12
•OpenWebText2 : A web scrape dataset produced by EleutherAI, inspired by WebText [RWC+19] and
OpenWebTextCorpus [GC19].
•Wikipedia (en) : The dataset, sourced from the TensorFlow Datasets13, includes articles from the English
Wikipedia as a standard source of high-quality text for language modeling.
•FreeLaw : This dataset is derived from the CourtListener platform14, part of the Free Law Project, which
provides access to legal opinions from federal and state courts in the United States.
•PubMed Abstracts : This dataset15includes abstracts from 30 million publications in PubMed, managed
by the National Library of Medicine. It encompasses the significantly limited coverage of full texts in
PubMed Central (PMC) and includes MEDLINE abstracts from 1946 to the present day.
•DeepMind Mathematics : A collection of mathematical problems from various topics formatted as nat-
ural language prompts [SGHK19]. It is included in The Pile to enhance the mathematical ability of the
language models [BMR+20].
•Project Gutenberg (PG-19) : This dataset consists of classic Western literature from Project Gutenberg,
specifically books published before 1919 [RPJ+20]. It represents distinct styles compared to the more
modern Books3 and BookCorpus datasets and is already used for long-distance context modeling.
•BookCorpus2 : An expanded version of the original BookCorpus [ZKZ+15], comprising books by un-
published authors, minimizing overlap with Project Gutenberg and Books3, which include published
books. It is commonly used for language model training [RNSS18].

•NIH Grant Abstracts : This dataset includes abstracts of awarded applications from the EXPORTER
service, covering fiscal years 1985-present. It was included because it features high-quality scientific
writing.18
•Enron Emails : This dataset [KY04] is widely used for analyzing email usage patterns. It was included to
aid in understanding the modality of email communications, which is typically not found in other datasets.
•GitHub : This dataset19consists of a large collection of open-source code repositories [BMR+20]. It was
included to improve the model’s downstream performance on code-related tasks, given GPT-3’s ability to
generate plausible code completions without any explicitly gathered code datasets.
Table 3 summarizes the composition of our dataset: a total of 395B tokens, including Arabic, English, and
programming code.
2.1 Preprocessing Pipeline
Preprocessing, which includes filtering, normalizing, and cleaning, has been shown to be a vital step in training
high-quality LLMs. We apply several standard preprocessing steps, combined with modules targeted at getting
high-quality Arabic content, in a data processing pipeline to generate our Arabic dataset of 72B tokens.

Table 3: Distribution of the three primary domains in our mixed pre-training dataset: we first augment the
Arabic data by adding 18B translated tokens, and then upsample the resulting Arabic dataset 1.6 times. ( The
numbers 72B and 395B are correct, and the summation discrepancies are due to rounding. )
An outline of our preprocessing pipeline for Arabic is provided in Figure 2. As explained above, the raw
data is primarily sourced from publicly available databases, such as Abu El Khair or BAAI, as well as through
in-house web scraping and machine translation of high-quality English sources.
Given that some of these sources have already been preprocessed or tokenized for NLP applications, it is
essential to standardize our input. We thus subject all sources to an initial detokenization step (which leaves
non-tokenized input unchanged) to achieve consistency. A document, at this step, is one article/web page,
depending on the source.
We then apply a large number of filtering rules in order to eliminate documents that are noisy or low-quality.
This includes removing extremely short or very long documents, or those that do not include a sufficiently high
proportion of Arabic characters or sentences, which could be indicators of a document in a different language
where Arabic characters appear only incidentally. We also remove documents that contain words more than 100
characters long, which can indicate the presence of extremely long URLs and/or an otherwise noisy document.
Once a document has passed the filtering step, it is subject to cleaning and normalization. We remove non-
printable Unicode characters and rare diacritic marks, and normalize the text using the Camel toolset for Arabic
[OZK+20]. We remove embedded JavaScript and HTML (which are common sources of noise in web-scraped
datasets), and highly-frequent words and phrases (which are typically boilerplate text, such as a news channel
name). We normalize Arabic punctuation marks, and use a lightweight n-gram LM to further identify and
remove noisy n-grams.
Finally, we apply a fuzzy deduplication step using standard locality-sensitive hashing techniques. After this
deduplication step, the size of the English dataset was about 20% of the original.

Things were more challenging for Arabic. Unlike English, where several large-scale and open-access
datasets already exist, and established preprocessing pipelines are available, for Arabic, this pipeline had to
be custom-built. Experimentation with smaller LLMs informed many of the choices of heuristics we used in
our final preprocessing pipeline. Given the limited amount of available Arabic data, we took care not to filter
Arabic content as aggressively as for English.
2.2 Mixing Arabic and English Data
A commonly reported phenomenon in LLM research is that larger LLMs generally perform better than smaller
ones; this trend is clearly visible on public LLM leaderboards20and is also evident in the recent LLaMA2
release [TMS+23].21In general, the quality of a model is limited by two main factors: ( i) data availability, and
(ii) computational cost. While the latter can be overcome with improved hardware, the former is a fundamental
obstacle. The Chinchilla scaling law [HBM+22] tells us that the optimal balance between model size and data
is approximately twenty tokens per parameter. This is why for English, the largest open-source LLMs until
recently had about 30B parameters, as publicly available datasets such as Red Pajama22have 1.2T tokens of
text. The recently-released LLaMA2 has 70B parameters, and it is trained on 2T tokens.
As mentioned above, for Arabic, we have 72 billion tokens (after adding 18 billion tokens of translated
text). If we apply the Chinchilla scaling law, we would optimally be able to train a model of 6-7B parameters on
this data. We could probably train a slightly larger model, as Arabic involves cltificization of conjunctions and
pronouns (e.g., and his house is one word in Arabic, but three words in English), and thus the scaling law might
differ a bit. Indeed, some of our experiments suggest that one might need as few as 14 tokens per parameter
for Arabic; yet, this does not fundamentally change the fact that we do not have enough data to train a 13B
parameter Arabic model, let alone a 30B one. One possible solution is to obtain more data, e.g., by adding more
Arabic social media posts, but these are generally noisy. Another option is to train on mixed Arabic and English
training data, and thus compensate for the missing Arabic tokens with English ones. This latter idea worked well
in our experiments: we found that mixing Arabic and English in a proportion of 1:2 (i.e., 2 ×more English than
Arabic) works better than training on Arabic only. In the future, we plan to try incorporating a higher proportion
of English, but we also need to be careful: for example, the BLOOMz experiments [MWS+23] indicate that
adding ten times as much English data results in degradation of the model performance.
3 Model
3.1 Model Architecture
Jais is based on a standard transformer-based architecture [VSP+17]. In particular, we use a causal decoder-
only model, similar to the one used by GPT-2 [RWC+19] and LLaMA [TLI+23]. Decoder-only models have
achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative language tasks. Building upon this base transformer archi-
tecture, we use a number of recent improvements from the literature, as well as from our own experiments.
Jais Tokenizer: The choice of tokenizer can have a significant impact on the performance of an NLP model
[LBM23]. How words are split is influenced by the composition of the corpora used to train the tokenizer
[PLMTB23]. A common tokenizer used in LLMs is the GPT-2 tokenizer [RWC+19], which is also used by
OPT [ZRG+22] and GPT-3 [BMR+20].

--- PAGE 10 ---
However, because the GPT-2 tokenizer is primarily trained on English corpora, common Arabic words such
as@	XAÖÏ(English ‘ why’) are over-segmented into individual characters [PLMTB23]. This over-segmentation
lowers the performance of the model and increases the computational costs compared to using a custom tok-
enizer that is specifically designed for the target languages [CL19]. Moreover, in order to increase the scope of
multi-linguality, we want the tokenizer to break words into meaningful subwords. This is likely to encourage
cross-lingual transfer by better token-level alignment between languages.
In order to achieve this, we trained our own subword tokenizer ( Jais tokenizer) on a combined corpus
of English and Arabic languages using byte-pair encoding (BPE) [SHB16]. To alleviate bias towards one
language, we prepared a training corpus of 10B words containing equal proportions of English and Arabic text.
Table 4 shows the fertility scores [BCP+90] of Jaistokenizer against the tokenizers of BERT Arabic23[SAY20],
BLOOM [SFA+23], and GPT-2 [RWC+19] on English, Arabic, and code validation datasets. We can observe
that the fertility score for the Jais tokenizer is close to 1, even though the vocabulary of Jais has only 84,992
entries, compared to BLOOM, which has 250,000 entries. The result shows the optimality of our custom-made
tokenizer over our test corpus as compared to other tokenizers.
ALiBi Positional Encodings: Positional embeddings provide information about word order to transformer-
based LLMs. A common strategy to manage training complexity is to train the model with a limited context
length. Subsequently, during inference, the model is applied to an extended context length using extrapola-
tion [SLP+22]. Recent research has indicated that conventional methods of integrating word order into the
transformer model, such as learnable positional embeddings, as used in models such as GPT-2 [RWC+19], and
sinusoidal encoding, as proposed in [VSP+17], do not perform well when applied to longer contexts [PSL22].
Thus, we use Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) positional encodings [PSL22], which support efficient ex-
trapolation to long contexts. Rather than modifying the input embeddings, ALiBi penalizes the attention scores
by a linearly decreasing amount, proportional to the distance between the relevant key and the query.
SwiGLU Activation Function: Activation functions play a pivotal role in the training of neural network
models. We use SwiGLU [Sha20] in each transformer block. It combines the advantages of Swish [RZL17]
and GLU [Sha20] activations, and has been shown to improve over both of them. Because of SwiGLU’s extra
computational overhead, adjustments were made in the hidden dimensionality of the feed forward network to
compensate. Rather than apply a filter dff= 4∗dmodel , we apply a filter that is8
3∗dmodel . This ensures that
the feed forward network has a FLOP cost that is comparable to that of GeLU activation.
Maximal Update Parametrization: Hyperparameter search in LLMs is expensive due to the size of the
model and the scale of the dataset used in training. Thus, it is not feasible to do an extensive hyperparameter
search on the final model. Fortunately, recent studies have shown that optimal hyperparameter values become
stable across neural network sizes when the models have been parametrized using maximal update parametriza-
tion (µP) [YHB+21]. For Jaishyperparameter search, we tuned the optimal values for batch size and learning
rate on a 40M-parameter model, and transferred the best values to our 13B-parameter model.
3.2 Model and Training Hyperparameters
Table 5 shows the number of layers, heads, and dimensionality for Jais, along with the optimization hyperpa-
rameter values and peak learning rates.
While training, we sampled a source from the source list described in Section 2 and generated instances with
a complete length of 2048 tokens. When a document was smaller than 2048 tokens, we concatenated several
documents into one sequence. <|endoftext|> is used to demarcate the end of each document, giving the
language model the information necessary to infer that tokens separated by <|endoftext|> are unrelated.

We train Jais-13b using the AdamW optimizer [LH18] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.95,ϵ= 1e−9, and weight
decay of 0.1. We scale the gradient norms using a maximum norm clipping value of 1.0. The learning rate
schedule starts with a linear warm-up from 0 to the maximum learning rate at 95 steps, followed by a 10 ×
linear decay until 100,551 steps. After packing, we used a global batch size of 3,392 sequences of 2,048 tokens
each. For µTransfer, we base Jais-13b on a roughly 40M-parameter model. The model depth is 24 and the
hidden dimension size is 256.
The base learning rate is set to a maximum value of 1.2e-2, and the learning rate for each layer is set
according to this base value depending on the layer shape [YHB+21]. Analogously, we initialize the layers
with a base standard deviation of 7.3e-2, which we adjust based on the layer shape. Additionally, we scale
the embedding’s output activations by a factor of 14.6, and scale the model’s output logits by a factor of 2.22
divided by the hidden size multiplier, e.g., 5,120 / 256 = 20.
3.3 Learnings and Observations
We conducted a series of preliminary experiments training on Arabic-only data, as well as on mixtures of Arabic
and English. The aim was to find the optimal mix, and to identify the best model size for our Arabic-centric
LLM. We maintained a constant size for the Arabic corpus as discussed in Section 2. We further sampled the
English dataset to reflect different ratios relative to the Arabic data size. In all cases, we trained the LLM for one
epoch. Previous work [BMR+20, KMH+20] has shown that cross-entropy loss correlates with LLM quality in
downstream tasks. Therefore, we report the cross-entropy loss on the Arabic validation set.
Due to the size of the search space and required computing resources, we did not train models of all sizes and
for all data ratios. Instead, we experimented on models of 590M, 1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B, 13B, and 30B parameters
under a few data ratios. The trends are shown in Figure 3. We can see that for small models, e.g., 590M and 1.3B
parameters, adding English impacts the cross entropy loss in Arabic adversely. However, this trend reverses for
larger models, e.g., for 6.7B and 13B parameters, where adding English improves Arabic performance. In
particular, we observe that the 13B model trained on a 1:2 Arabic–English mix ( Jais-13b ) outperforms the 30B-
parameter Arabic-only model by a sizable margin. This suggests that increasing the model capacity improves
the cross-lingual transfer between English and Arabic. In future work, we plan to study the extent to which
additional English data can be incorporated without adversely affecting the performance of Arabic.

3.4 Training Infrastructure
All training, hyper-parameter tuning, and instruction-tuning experiments were executed on the Condor Galaxy
1 (CG-1)24AI supercomputer from Cerebras, built in partnership with G42. The final training and fine-tuning
runs for Jaiswere performed on 16 CS-2 systems within CG-1. CG-1 is a Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster com-
posed of Cerebras CS-2 systems, MemoryX, SwarmX, management, and input worker nodes. The foundation
of the CG-1 cluster is the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) within the CS-2 system, the largest and most
powerful AI processor currently available. CS-2 systems are purpose-built network-attached AI accelerators.
MemoryX is a large-capacity off-wafer memory service, used to store all model weights, gradients, and opti-
mizer states. SwarmX is a broadcast/reduce fabric that connects the memory service MemoryX to each of the
CS-2 systems in a wafer-scale cluster. Swarm-X coordinates the broadcast of the model layer weights, giving
each CS-2 a local copy, and it receives and aggregates (by addition) the independent weight gradients coming
from the CS-2 systems during backpropagation. At the end of each iteration, the aggregated gradients are sent
to MemoryX for weight update.
The CG-1 hardware and software stack enables training extremely large models using data parallelism by
relying on a special execution mode available with Cerebras Wafer Scale Clusters, called weight streaming.
Weight streaming fully bypasses the complexity of 3D parallelism on traditional GPU clusters, and provides
simpler and higher performance scaling.
4 Instruction-Tuning
LLMs can produce coherent text and execute an extensive array of NLP tasks, requiring only a few task exam-
ples as input. Nonetheless, the model cannot interpret user instructions or engage in dialogue-style interactions
without instruction-tuning [OWJ+22]. To tailor our LLMs for dialogue-style applications, we instruction-tuned
them on a dataset prepared for instruction-based adaptation in English and Arabic. We refer to our instruction-
tuned model as Jais-chat .
4.1 Instruction-Tuning Data
As we have a bilingual model, we use a combination of Arabic and English instruction-tuning datasets. We
include a wide range of datasets covering various domains in single-turn and multi-turn chat formats. We have
10M prompt–response pairs in total, made up of 4M in Arabic and 6M in English; see Tables 6 and 7 for detailed
stastistics about the datasets we use. Below, we provide a brief description of each dataset.
4.1.1 English Instruction-tuning Datasets
Super-NaturalInstructions [WMA+22] encompasses 76 types of tasks, such as classification, extraction, in-
filling, and sequence tagging. These instructions span a comprehensive range of 1,616 diverse NLP tasks,
all presented in expert-written instruction–response pair format. P3[SWR+21] and xP3 (Code & English)
[MWS+23] are collections of prompted datasets that cover a diverse set of NLP tasks in instruction–response
format. The P3dataset contains over 2,000 prompt types from 270 different public datasets in English. xP3
(Code & English) is designed for multi-lingual and cross-lingual instruction-tuning and contains more than 9M
examples in 46 languages, including programming languages. To make our model diverse, we included at most
five thousand examples from each task of the Super-NaturalInstructions dataset; from P3andxP3 (Code & En-
glish) , we only include English and programming code examples. The Natural Questions dataset25comprises
question–answer pairs extracted from Google Search; it only includes questions with concise answers, which
can be addressed using the information found in English Wikipedia [KPR+19].
Baize-Chatbot26is a multi-turn dialogue-style instruction-tuning dataset. HH-RLHF is designed for helpful
and harmless assistance through preference modelling [OWJ+22], and has an accepted and a rejected response
for each prompt; we only use the former. Alpaca-CoT [QS23] is a fusion of nine Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
[WWS+22] datasets released by FLAN [CHL+22]. Self-instruct [WKM+23] is a bootstrapping algorithm that
uses a small set of manually written instructions to prompt an LLM to generate new instructions.

We used the dataset provided by the authors, which was cleaned and filtered to remove low-quality or
similar pairs. Alpaca-Cleaned27,Instruct-Wild [XJS+23], Unnatural Instruction [HSLS23] and GPTeacher28
are prepared using the same method, but using ChatGPT [BMR+20].
Open Instruction Generalist (OIG)29,GPT4ALL-J [AND+23], and Dolly-15k [CHM+23] were constructed
to train assistant-style LLMs in a semi-automatic way, and are moderate in quality. From GPT4ALL-J , we ran-
domly sampled 100,000 examples from v1.0.30HC3 [GZW+23] is a manually curated dataset for comparing the
response of humans and ChatGPT; we used the former only. From HC3 , we only included examples from four
domains: finance, medicine, Wikipedia, and OpenQA. GSM-General-QA31,Math-Instruction32andGrade-
School-Math33are instruction-tuning datasets prepared to assist in mathematical problems. Finally, Instruction-
Poems34andEssays-with-Instructions35target poem and essay writing, and Stack-Exchange-Instruction36and
Python-QA37are aimed at programming code tasks.
In order to enhance the conversational abilities of our fine-tuned model, we integrated dialogue-based and
persona-based datasets into the instruction-tuning procedure. For this purpose, we curated 19 in-house question–
answer pairs that revolved around the LLM developer, and we also processed the Basic-Conv38dataset to incor-
porate it into our instruction-tuning process.

We further created our own set of question–answer pairs related to the UAE and the local region, based
on information from relevant Wikipedia pages and other sources. We refer to this dataset as NativeQA and
incorporate it into the fine-tuning process. We also prepared an instruction dataset to teach the model about
safety issues, named it SafetyQA . As a responsible language model, we want the model to avoid engaging in
unsafe conversations e.g. discussions on self-harm, sexual violence, or identity attacks. For this, we prepared
prompt-response from DoNotAnswer [WLH+23] and OLID [ZMN+19]. In all these prompts, the response is
a polite rejection of the question. The impact is explored in Section 6.
4.1.2 Arabic Instruction-Tuning Datasets
Due to the limited availability of instruction-tuning datasets for Arabic, we translated some of the above En-
glish instruction-tuning datasets to Arabic using the same machine translation system that we used for the
training data: Supernatural Instruction ,Unnatural ,NaturalQuestions ,Alpaca [TGZ+23], HC3 ,Dolly-15k ,
Baize ,Basic-Conv ,Bactrian [LKW+23]. We then performed a manual assessment for each task within the
Super-NaturalInstructions dataset, and excluded tasks that were primarily related to translation as well as those
relating to counting words, as they could break when translated to Arabic (i.e., their is no guarantee the trans-
lated text has the same number of words as the original English).
Apart from the translated datasets, we also included the Arabic examples from xP3 (Code & English) . We
further formatted AraNER [BRB07] to the instruction–response format ( NER-Ar ) and added it as a dataset for
instruction-tuning. Moreover, similarly to English, we created additional datasets NativeQA-Ar andSafetyQA-
Arwith instruction–response pairs related to the UAE and the region as well as safety, but this time in Arabic;
note that we created these natively in Arabic. We further translated the English datasets that we created to
Arabic, and we used them as additional datasets.
4.2 Instruction-Tuning Setup
In instruction-tuning, each instance comprises a pair of a prompt and its corresponding response, and the model
needs to be able to distinguish between them. We thus wrap each instance within a template as illustrated in
Figure 4, where we have additional special markers to indicate what is the human input and what is the expected
response. Note that we use different templates for single-turn question–answer pairs vs. dialog interactions. We
further use padding for each instance, as we cannot pack examples during instruction-tuning (unlike pretraining
where we pack the documents until the maximum sequence length has been reached). We use the same autore-
gressive objective as for pretraining the LLM. However, similarly to Alpaca [TGZ+23], we mask the loss of the
prompt, i.e., we perform backpropagation on the answer tokens only, which ensures that short responses are not
penalized.

5 Evaluation
5.1 Downstream Evaluation
Datasets We perform a comparative evaluation of JaisandJais-chat against other LLMs for both Arabic and
English, building upon the evaluations conducted in prior studies [TLI+23, TMS+23, Ope23, SFA+23]. For
each language, our evaluation encompasses aspects such as knowledge, reasoning, misinformation, and bias, as
outlined in Table 8. To extend the evaluation to Arabic, we use an in-house English-to-Arabic translation system
(as discussed in Section 2), and additionally we hired native speakers of Arabic to manually translate the MMLU
dataset [HBB+22] from English to Arabic. We further added two additional datasets, with question–answering
pairs that were in Arabic: ( i)EXAMS [HMZ+20], a set of school examination questions in various languages
(we took the Arabic questions only), and ( ii) a new manually-constructed LiteratureQA dataset.39
•World Knowledge . Validating the knowledge embedded within a pre-trained language model is crucial,
given its extensive training on a vast amount of textual data. We evaluate the knowledge of our mod-
els on four different datasets: (1) MMLU [HBB+22], a multiple-choice exam question set covering 57
tasks spanning various educational levels, from school subjects to university and professional exams; (2)
RACE [LXL+17], a reading comprehension task constructed from English exams for middle and high
school Chinese students; (3) EXAMS [HMZ+20], multilingual high school questions from natural and
social sciences covering 16 languages including Arabic; and (4) LiteratureQA , a collection of multiple-
choice questions focused on Arabic literature at the university level.
•Commonsense Reasoning . Making inference from text requires logical reasoning, and language models
that undergo pre-training on extensive textual data have been shown to be able to do such reasoning. We
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of language models using seven datasets: (1) HellaSwag [ZHB+19], a
sentence completion dataset for commonsense natural language inference, constructed using adversarial
filtering, (2) PIQA [BZB+20], a set of questions that require reasoning, centered around physical activi-
ties, (3) BoolQ [CLC+19], a yes/no reading comprehension question dataset that requires a wide range of
inferential capabilities, (4) SituatedQA [ZC21], a question-answering dataset that is conditioned on tem-
poral and geographical context, (5) ARC-Challenge [CCE+18], a dataset comprising science questions
typically encountered at the grade-school level, demanding considerably enhanced knowledge and rea-
soning capabilities,40(6)OpenBookQA [MCKS18], an elementary science question dataset designed to
evaluate broad common knowledge, and (7) WinoGrande [SBBC21], a dataset comprising expert-crafted
pronoun resolution tasks that require common-sense reasoning.
39This dataset was created in house by manually digitizing university-level Arabic language question papers from the following sources:
http://www.examrace.com/ ,http://arabicuniversitycollege.yolasite.com
40ForARC-Challenge , we only use the Challenge dataset, which presents a higher level of difficulty compared to the Easy dataset.

•Misinformation and Bias . We also evaluate the faithfulness and the biases of our LLMs based on two
datasets: (1) TruthfulQA [LHE22], which contains expert-crafted questions that measure the extent of
model misconception on the topics of health, law, finance, and politics; and (2) CrowS-Pairs [NVBB20],
a dataset to assess stereotype biases against protected attributes such as race, religion, and age.
Evaluation Setup We perform an extensive evaluation where we compare our LLMs to twenty baseline mod-
els that support Arabic and/or English. Some models are trained to support Arabic: AraT5 and AraT5-v2
(220M) [NEAM22], AraBART (139M) [KETH+22], mT0 (1.2B, 3.7B, 13B) [MWS+23], BLOOM (1.7B, 3B,
7.1B) [SFA+23], and BLOOMz (1.7B, 3B, 7.1B) [MWS+23]. Other models are not trained for Arabic, but
still can answer questions in Arabic, probably because some amount of Arabic data was present in their pre-
training and/or instruction-tuning datasets: LLaMA (7B, 13B) [TLI+23], LLaMA2 and LLaMA2-chat (7B,
13B) [TMS+23], and Falcon (7B) [PMH+23].
We adopt the LM-Evaluation-Harness framework [GTB+21] to evaluate each model in a zero-shot setting,
and we report the accuracy for each task. Within the LM-Evaluation-Harness framework, the context string
is concatenated with each candidate output string, and the answer is determined by selecting the concatenated
string with the highest normalized log-likelihood.
Results for Arabic Table 9 shows the zero-shot evaluation results for Arabic. We can see that our Jais and
Jais-chat models exhibit superior performance across all evaluation criteria, establishing them as the new state-
of-the-art LLMs for Arabic. Specifically, in comparison to monolingual Arabic models (AraT5, AraT5-v2 and
AraBART), Jais-chat (13B) achieves absolute performance improvements of +11.7 to +15.3. This is particularly
pronounced in the domains of knowledge acquisition and commonsense reasoning.
We can further see that BLOOMz (7.1B) is the best baseline model for Arabic, with an average accuracy
of 42.9, which is better than mT0-xxl (13B), which has an accuracy of 40.9. Notably, Falcon, LLaMA, and
LLaMA2 lag behind, which should not be surprising given their limited exposure to Arabic pre-training data.
We see that Jais-chat (6.7B) outperforms these baselines (including the 13B models) by +3.5 to +10.9 points
absolute. Moreover, Jais-chat (13B) widens the gap even further, with an additional overall improvement of
+1.9 points over Jais-chat (6.7B).
Instruction-tuning [OWJ+22] further improves the results over the corresponding base models, with the
exception of Falcon (7B). The absolute improvements due to instruction-tuning for Jais-chat (1.3B, 6.7B, 13B)
are +0.7, +3.2, and +1.9, respectively, and are similar to those for BLOOMz. The full results for each dataset
and model can be found in the Appendix (Table 12).

dataset, and tuned indicates that the model is instruction-tuned.
Results for English We also performed an evaluation for English. The results are given in Table 10, where
we can see that Jais-chat is highly competitive against existing English models, despite having seen less En-
glish data in pretraining. First, we observe that the existing Arabic models perform almost randomly on this
benchmark, while our models perform substantially better. This result is unsurprising given that AraT5, AraT5-
V2, and AraBART were pretrained on Arabic data only. In comparison to the multilingual BLOOMz (1.1B),
Jais-chat (1.3B) performs +3.4 points better. We can further see that Jais-chat (13B) performs on par with the
recently released LLaMA2-chat (13B) model (57.3 vs. 57.7), even though the latter is trained on 2T of English
word tokens, while our model has only seen 232B English word token. Jais-chat (13B) also outperforms other
baselines including mT0-xxl (13B) and Falcon (7B), by margins ranging from +2.6 to +7.2 points absolute. Our
instruction-tuning is also effective, with improvements of +3.9, +4.3, and +3.4, for the 1.3B, 6.7B, and 13B
models, respectively. The full results for each dataset and model can be found in the Appendix (Table 13).
5.2 Generation Evaluation
Dataset We next perform evaluation of the models over the core capability of Arabic text generation. Follow-
ing prior work [PLH+23, CLL+23], we perform automatic evaluation over the generated Arabic content using
GPT-4 [Ope23] based on Vicuna-Instructions-80 , which were manually translated to Arabic by translators.

Table 10: Zero-shot evaluation results for English . We can see that our model is competitive on English despite
being Arabic-centric. Average is the mean score computed across the entire dataset, and tuned indicates that the
model is instruction-tuned.
Vicuna-Instructions-8041consists of 80 challenging and open-ended questions across eight categories: knowl-
edge, Fermi, counterfactual, roleplay, generic, math and coding, writing, and common-sense.
Evaluation Setup We generate outputs for Arabic prompts in Vicuna-Instructions-80 using a temperature of
0.3 and a repetition penalty of 1.2. As baselines, we use two closed-source models, ChatGPT (175B) [OWJ+22]
and Claude (52B).42We further use several open-source models, which are either Arabic centric or multilin-
gual: BLOOM (7B) [SFA+23], BLOOMz (7B) [MWS+23], AraT5 (220M) [NEAM22], AraT5-v2 (220M)
[NEAM22], AraBART (550M) [KETH+22], and LLaMA2 (13B) [TMS+23]. We also include as baselines
Bactrian-X LLaMA (13B) and Bactrian-X BLOOM (7B) [LKW+23], which are LLaMA and BLOOM base models,
respectively, fine-tuned on multi-lingual (including Arabic) instruction-tuning datasets. For convenience, we
name them BX LLaMA and BX BLOOM , respectively. We evaluate these baselines against our instruction-tuned
models – Jais-chat (6.7B) and Jais-chat (13B). During the GPT-4 evaluation, we perform pairwise compar-
isons between all pairs of models. We first prompt GPT-4 to score each pair of models based on their outputs
generated for the prompts in the Arabic Vicuna-Instructions-80 . We randomly permute the answers from both
candidates, aiming to have any one as the first candidate at random, and we prompt GPT-4 as follows:

You are a helpful and precise assistant for checking the quality of two Arabic assistants. Suppose
the user only speaks Arabic, please evaluate both answers with your justification, and provide an
integer score ranging from 0 to 10 after your justifications. When evaluating the answers, you
should consider the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, and level of detail of the answers. The score
for answer 1 should be wrapped by <score1> and</score1> , and the score for answer 2
should be wrapped by <score2> and</score2> .
Results First, we find that certain models struggle to generate meaningful Arabic text according to the given
instructions. This observation applies particularly to models that have not undergone instruction-following fine-
tuning, namely BLOOM, AraT5, AraT5-v2 and AraBART. Additionally, some models produce subpar Arabic
text, with average scores lower than 1 (out of 10) when evaluated against Jais-chat (13B) — these models
include BLOOMz and LLaMA2. While BLOOMz is competitive in downstream task evaluation (see Table 9),
it is unable to follow Arabic instructions, despite being pretrained using 73G of Arabic text [SFA+23].
With these observations, we focus on comparing the top 6 models: ChatGPT, Claude, BX BLOOM , BX LLaMA ,
Jais-chat (6.7B), and Jais-chat (13B). As there are six models in total, each one is compared against the other
five models, resulting in 400 scores (80 questions ×5 pairs) for every individual model. Since each score ranges
from 0 to 10, summing up these scores for a model brings the maximum possible total score to 4,000.
The overall comparative results are shown in Figure 5. While both ChatGPT (175B) and Claude (52B)
outperform Jais-chat (13B), it is important to note that ( i) they are 4–13 times larger, and ( ii) the difference in
scores between our Jais-chat (13B) and these larger models is relatively modest, at around 400 points.
When focusing solely on certain types of tasks, including common-sense, knowledge-based, writing-related,
and generic inquiries, the disparity between Jais-chat and ChatGPT/ Claude diminishes. Jais-chat is only 35
scores behind Claude and 114 scores behind ChatGPT, out of a total of 2,000, as illustrated in Figure 6.

questions (the left subfigures). However, it performs worse for counterfactual, roleplay, and Fermi questions,
and is substantially worse at math and coding questions.
Figure 7 shows a breakdown of the scores across various tasks. For the categories in Figure 6 including
common-sense, knowledge-based, writing-related, and generic inquiries, Jais-chat performs generally better.
This is particularly true for writing, where Jais-chat is almost on par with ChatGPT and Claude. In other task
categories, including counterfactual, Fermi, roleplay, and math-and-coding, Jais-chat is worse than ChatGPT
and Claude. This is expected, since these categories require a higher degree of reasoning, and the smaller size
of the Jais-chat models puts them at a disadvantage.
6 Safety
We used several strategies and precautionary measures to make Jais-chat safer to interact with and to minimize
potential risks. These precautionary measures were incorporated at various stages of the model development.
During the instruction-tuning process, we encoded safety measures into Jais-chat . Moreover, towards de-
veloping an interactive application based on Jais-chat , we implemented several practical and simple safety
measures, which we describe here with the aim of providing developers examples of guardrails to be considered
during the application development for end-users.
20

--- PAGE 21 ---
6.1 Safety via Instruction-Tuning
To ensure that Jais-chat has in-built safeguards on the content it generates, we have focused on this aspect
during instruction-tuning. This involves avoiding the generation of content in the five risk areas identified by
[WMR+21]. Through the process of instruction-tuning, we impart the following principles to Jais: (1) refrain
from generating language that promotes discrimination, exclusion, or toxicity, regardless of user request or pref-
erence; (2) uphold privacy standards by preventing the leakage of private or sensitive information; (3) exercise
caution in disseminating accurate information and responding thoughtfully to queries that could potentially lead
to material harm, such as those related to fields like medicine or law; (4) reject engagement in any form of ma-
licious use, including inquiries about unethical or illegal activities; and (5) counteract emotional manipulation
by transparently indicating that the model is a chatbot and not a human, particularly when there is a discernible
overreliance on its responses. Furthermore, we also add some examples that aim to teach Jais-chat to avoid
engaging in discussions on sensitive topics, particularly such concerning certain aspects of religion and politics.
We crawled data from various Arabic websites, encompassing a wide spectrum of materials related to re-
ligion and politics, and amassed approximately 1,000 instances in Arabic. Given the constraints of available
Arabic resources, we expanded our dataset by incorporating content in English. To this end, we integrated
theDoNotAnswer dataset [WLH+23], which comprises around 6,000 questions designed to potentially pro-
voke harmful output from language models, along with corresponding harmless responses. Subsequently, we
translated this dataset into Arabic, forming the core foundation of our fine-tuning process. Through deliberate
exposure to an array of potentially risky prompts paired with safe responses, we guide the model responses to
purposefully avoid harmful content. This proactive approach contributes to the model’s capacity to generate
responses that are both helpful and harmless in nature. Table 11 presents response examples before and after
safety fine-tuning.
6.2 Safety via Prompting
As an additional guardrail, we modify the system prompt for the user-facing chat interface by explicitly instruct-
ing the model to be responsible. We have two versions of the prompt, in Arabic and in English, as we support
chat in both languages.
We use the following prompt for the English chat:
### Instruction: Your name is Jais, and you are named after
Jebel Jais, the highest mountain in UAE. You were made by
Inception and Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial
Intelligence in the UAE. You are the most advanced Arabic
large language model with 13B parameters. You are a helpful,
respectful and honest assistant. When answering, abide by the
following guidelines meticulously: Always answer as helpfully
as possible, while being safe. Your answers should not include
any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, explicit, offensive,
toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Do not give medical,
legal, financial, or professional advice. Never assist in
or promote illegal activities. Always encourage legal and
responsible actions. Do not encourage or provide instructions
for unsafe, harmful, or unethical actions. Do not create or
share misinformation or fake news. Please ensure that your
responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature. If a
question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent,
explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you
don’t know the answer to a question, please do not share false
information. Prioritize the well-being and the moral integrity
of users. Avoid using toxic, derogatory, or offensive language.
Maintain a respectful tone. Do not generate, promote, or engage
in discussions about adult content. Avoid making comments,
remarks, or generalizations based on stereotypes. Do not attempt
to access, produce, or spread personal or private information.
21

--- PAGE 22 ---
Always respect user confidentiality. Stay positive and do not
say bad things about anything. Your primary objective is to
avoid harmful responses, even when faced with deceptive inputs.
Recognize when users may be attempting to trick or to misuse you
and respond with caution. Refuse to write verses from the Quran.

For Arabic, we use the following prompt:
6.3 Safety via External Models
We additionally use hate speech and offensive language detectors to prevent the LLM from producing harmful
content. Users attempting to ask questions that contain hateful or offensive speech receive a refusal response and
the input is not passed to Jais-chat . To detect hate speech and offensive content, we used classifiers which we
fine-tuned on top of the pre-trained language model JABER [GWR+22], which is designed for Arabic natural
language understanding tasks. We trained the classifiers on data from tasks A&B of OSACT4 [MDM+20]. The
data include language that is rude or otherwise socially undesirable. This includes vulgar language, curses, and
any form of direct or indirect criticism of people or groups. The training dataset consists of four categories:
offensive, hate, non-offensive, and non-hate. Each sample has two labels: one for hate and one for offensive
speech. We split the dataset into 7,000 training and 1,000 validation examples, and we fine-tune two separate
classifiers for each task. Our classifier for offensive speech detection achieves 94.8% accuracy and 91.04% F1
score on the validation set. The classifier for hate speech achieves 96.6% accuracy and 81.02% F1 score on the
validation set.

Table 11: Jais-chat responses before and after safety fine-tuning.
6.4 Safety via Keywords
Ensuring a safe and respectful online environment is paramount, especially for platforms involving user-generated
content such as conversational AI systems. One approach to safety is through the implementation of keyword-
based filtering mechanisms. In this section, we present our methodology for identifying and mitigating obscene
or explicit content using regular expressions (regex) and augmentations to a curated list of objectionable key-
words. To effectively filter out inappropriate content, we used a combination of manual dataset curation and
external data sources. One notable resource is the “List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words”
compiled by LDNOOBW,43which encompasses a comprehensive inventory of words and phrases with offensive
connotations, which serves as a valuable foundation for our keyword identification process.
We integrated the identified keywords into regex patterns, allowing us to efficiently scan user-generated
content for instances of potentially offensive language. When a user’s input contains flagged keywords, our
system immediately responds with a safe refusal message instead of calling Jais-chat . The regex-based approach
facilitates real-time detection and mitigation of inappropriate content. The effectiveness of this method in
enhancing the safety and the appropriateness of interactions underscores its significance in upholding a positive,
secure, and respectful user experience.
While our approach effectively addresses explicit content, it is important to acknowledge its limitations,
including potential false positives and the dynamic nature of language usage. Our ongoing efforts to keep the
quality high include continuous refinement of the keyword list and exploration of advanced natural language
processing techniques in order to further enhance the accuracy and the effectiveness of our content filtering
system.

7 Related Work
Below, we discuss previous work on the following relevant topics: Arabic language models, LLMs in general,
instruction-tuning, and evaluation of LLMs.
Arabic Language Models Arabic language models have been developed across various architectures and
learning objectives. Examples of encoder-only models include AraBERT [ABH20], QARiB [AHM+21], JABER
and SABER[GWR+22], CAMeLBERT [IAB+21], AraELECTRA [ABH21a], GigaBERT [LCXR20], and AR-
BERT & MARBERT [AMEN21]. There have been also decoder-only models such as ARAGPT2 [ABH21b]. In
the encoder–decoder category, prominent models include AraT5 [NEAM22] and AraBART [ETH+22]. These
models, when fine-tuned, have demonstrated competitiveness in both natural language understanding and natu-
ral language generation tasks.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no public Arabic language model has been trained with over a billion
parameters, capable of showcasing generalization and robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks.44In
addition to monolingual models, Arabic has also been integrated into multilingual models, including earlier
models such as mBERT [DCLT19] and XLM-RoBERTa [CKG+20], as well as more recent large language
models such as BLOOM [SFA+23]. However, due to the Arabic content being dwarfed by other languages,
these models tend to perform substantially worse than dedicated monolingual models and often exhibit limited
generalization abilities in zero-shot settings [LKW+23].
Large Language Models Language models with ever larger numbers of parameters have consistently im-
proved over smaller models such as BERT [DCLT19], BART [LLG+19], and T5 [RSR+20]. Despite their
extensive training on multilingual text data, recent large language models have an English-centric bias and are
less effective for languages beyond English [LKW+23]. An exception to this trend is GLM [ZLD+23], which
is the sole large language model specifically designed to excel in both Chinese and English.
Existing pretraining frameworks for language models fall into three categories: autoregressive, autoencod-
ing, and encoder–decoder models. Most recent large language models, such as the GPT series [RWC+19,
BMR+20, Ope23], LLaMA [TLI+23, TMS+23], BLOOM [SFA+23], and Falcon [AAA+23], are autore-
gressive, using a left-to-right language model objective. Earlier models such as BERT [DCLT19], ELEC-
TRA [CLLM20], and RoBERTa [LOG+19] are encoder-only, while BART [LLG+19] and T5 [RSR+20] are
encoder–decoder models. As elaborated in Section 3.1, Jais andJais-chat follow the autoregressive model
paradigm, building upon the successes of LLaMA2 and GPT-4.
Progress in large language models can also be categorized into two streams: closed-source and open-
source models. Closed-source models such as Bard,45Claude,46Gopher [RBC+22], and GPT-4 [Ope23] offer
fewer advantages to the research community compared to open-source models [TMS+23, SFA+23]. The lack
of model transparency exposes leads to various risks for closed-source models, including privacy concerns
[MGU+22, YRC23] and safety issues [SXD+22]. In contrast, Jais andJais-chat are open-source models, as
elaborated in Section 3.
Instruction-Tuning Fine-tuning language models using instruction–response pairs has enhanced the gener-
alization capabilities of language models across various tasks [OWJ+22]. In terms of open-source models,
BLOOMz [MWS+23] is a fine-tuned version of the foundation model BLOOM [SFA+23] based on large-scale
instruction-tuning over a dataset created via templates, while LLaMA2 [TMS+23] uses a publicly available
instruction–response pair dataset [CHL+22]. Moreover, instruction-tuning has been coupled with reinforcement
learning with human feedback (RLHF). This combination aligns the generated responses to reward functions,
optimizing the model’s factuality, and reducing its toxicity [OWJ+22].
The prompts used for instruction-tuning can have diverse origins. Some, as observed by [ZMH+23], are
human-designed, while others can be autonomously generated. These prompts can be refined with follow-up in-
structions for more relevant or specific outputs, as studied by [GAS+23] and [MTG+23]. Recently, [WWS+22]
introduced chain-of-thought prompting , directing models to clarify their reasoning over complex tasks, which
was shown to enhance their accuracy.
44JASMINE [NAME+22] are Arabic GPT models ranging in sizes from 350M to 13B parameters, but these models have not been
released to the public, and the arXiv paper describing them says the 6.7B and 13B models are still training.

Evaluating Large Language Models Large language models are proficient at generating coherent and flu-
ent text, but have shortcomings in terms of factuality and reasoning skills. As a proxy to evaluate factual-
ity, existing English large language models such as GPT-4 [Ope23] and LLaMA [TLI+23] use school exam
questions [HBB+22] to understand how faithful the models are at providing knowledge. Evaluating common-
sense reasoning abilities is also important, and is the target of datasets such as HellaSwag [ZHB+19], Wino-
Grande [SBBC21], ARC easy and challenge [CCE+18], and OpenBookQA [MCKS18]. Moreover, reasoning
via programming is evaluated using HumanEval [CTJ+21] and MBPP [AON+21].
In Arabic NLP, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating natural language understanding tasks.
For instance, the ALUE benchmark [STG+21] encompasses semantic tasks such as irony detection [GKB+19],
emotion classification [MBMSK18], sentiment classification [MBMSK18], offensive language [MDM+20] and
hate speech identification [MDM+20]. Existing Arabic benchmarks, however, do not include knowledge and
commonsense evaluation, posing a challenge for the assessment of Jais.
In contrast, in other languages, researchers have effectively used methods such as machine translation or
the construction of datasets in a similar manner to assess the knowledge proficiency and the commonsense
understanding of language models [Ope23, LKW+23]. In this context, as detailed in Section 5, we used a
combination of techniques, including crafting analogous datasets to those available for English, using human
translations and our in-house machine translation system to convert English datasets into Arabic for the purposes
of evaluation.
Evaluating only on knowledge [HBB+22, LZK+23] and commonsense reasoning [ZHB+19, SBBC21]
based on the evaluation settings of prior work [TLI+23, MWS+23] is arguably not a holistic evaluation, as
they are multiple-choice questions. To evaluate the generated text as a whole, human evaluation remains cru-
cial. Unfortunately, it is both resource-intensive and sometimes exhibits variable quality, especially when using
crowd-sourcing. Recent studies [T ¨or23, LXA23, GRS+23, WA23] have even suggested that ChatGPT anno-
tation surpasses the performance of Amazon crowd-sourced workers, underscoring the importance of expert
workers in the evaluation process. Expanding upon these findings, another study [PLH+23, CLL+23] used
GPT-4 as a substitute for crowd-sourced workers to compare two model outputs. This is achieved by presenting
an evaluation prompt and providing both model outputs as a context for the assessment.
8 Conclusion
We have introduced Jais, a new state-of-the-art Arabic-English bilingual large language model (LLM), as well
as its instruction-tuned variant, Jais-chat . The latter can perform a wide range of generative and downstream
language tasks in both Arabic and English, ranging from common-sense reasoning to natural language un-
derstanding tasks such as sentiment analysis, irony detection, and hate speech detection. Its pre-trained and
fine-tuned capabilities outperform all known open-source Arabic models, and are comparable to state-of-the-art
open-source English models that were trained on larger datasets. We encourage researchers, hobbyists, and
enterprise developers alike to experiment with and to develop on top of our model, particularly those working
on multi-lingual and/or non-English applications.
Jais represents an important evolution and expansion of the NLP and AI landscape in the Middle East.
This first-of-a-kind Arabic model born in the UAE represents an important strategic step for government and
commercial organizations towards the digital revolution. By advancing Arabic language understanding and
generation, empowering local players with sovereign and private deployment options, and nurturing a vibrant
ecosystem of applications and innovation, this work supports a broader strategic initiative of digital and AI
transformation to usher in an open, more linguistically-inclusive, and culturally-aware era.
9 Release Notes
We release the models under Apache 2.0 license. Users of Jais must comply with the terms of the provided
license, and applicable policies, laws, and regulations governing the specific use case and region. We encourage
researchers, hobbyists, and enterprise developers alike to experiment with and to develop on top of the model –
particularly those working on multi-lingual and/or non-English applications.

9.1 Intended Use
This model is not only the first of its kind in the Arabic LLM ecosystem, but it also has been shown to be the
best in the world among open Arabic or multilingual LLMs in terms of Arabic NLP capabilities. Some potential
downstream uses are listed below:
• Research: This model can be used by researchers and developers to advance the Arabic LLM/NLP field.
• Commercial Use: It can be used as a foundational model to further fine-tune for specific usecases (like
Jais-chat ). Some potential usecases for businesses include (1) chat-assistants, (2) downstream tasks such
as NLU/NLG, (3) customer service, and (4) process automation.
We believe that a number of audiences will benefit from our model:
• Academics: those researching Arabic natural language processing.
• Businesses: companies targeting Arabic-speaking audiences.
• Developers: those integrating Arabic language capabilities in apps.
9.2 Out-of-Scope Use
While Jaisis a powerful Arabic and English bilingual model, it is essential to understand its limitations and the
potential for its misuse. The following are some scenarios, but not limited to, where the model should not be
used:
•Malicious Use : The model should not be used for generating harmful, misleading, or inappropriate
content. This includes but is not limited to ( i) generating or promoting hate speech, violence, or discrim-
ination, ( ii) spreading misinformation or fake news, ( iii) engaging in illegal activities or promoting them,
(i) (iv) handling sensitive information: the model should not be used to handle or to generate personal,
confidential, or sensitive information.
•Generalization Across All Languages :Jais is bilingual and optimized for Arabic and English, and it
should not be assumed to have equal proficiency in other languages or dialects.
•High-Stakes Decisions : The model should not be used for making high-stakes decisions without human
oversight. This includes medical, legal, financial, or safety-critical decisions, among others.
9.3 Biases, Risks, and Limitations
The model is trained on publicly available data which in part (Arabic) was curated by our preprocessing pipeline.
We used different techniqes to reduce the bias that is inadvertently present in the dataset. While efforts were
made to minimize biases, it is still possible that our model, like all LLM models, may exhibit some biases.
The model is trained as an AI assistant for Arabic and English speakers, and thus it should be used to help
humans to boost their productivity. In this context, it is limited to produce responses for queries in these two
languages and it might not produce appropriate responses for queries in other languages.
Potential misuses include generating harmful content, spreading misinformation, or handling sensitive in-
formation. Users are urged to use the model responsibly and with discretion.

How do I cook Machboos? Here is an easy and delicious chicken Machboos recipe you can try: heat vegetable oil in a deep
frying cook onions and garlic until they are gold. Add the chicken pieces and continue cooking
until they turn golden brown. The mixture is seasoned with salt and fresh ground black pepper
according to taste and leave it aside for processing. To make the sauce, mix tomato sauce, ground
coriander, laurel leaf, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, chicken stock cube into a bowl and add enough
water to make a thick paste. Put the pre-washed and soaked rice in a strainer to strain the excess
water and then put it in the deep pot. pour enough chicken stock over rice to cover it completely by
about 2 cm. lightly sprinkled salt on rice and put it on high fire. When the mixture boils, lower the
heat to medium and let the rice be cooked for another 15 minutes until ripe. After finishing cooking
the rice, heat the sauce again and mix it well to ensure the cube melts completely. Then add the
mixture to the cooked chicken, onions and garlic and stir it well to ensure that the ingredients
are mixed together. Let them cook for a few extra minutes until the sauce gets a little thick and
the spices, chicken and rice taste imbibed. Served the Machboos hot and decorated with chopped
coriander, parsley, roasted almonds, and raisins. Bon Apetit!

How do I apply for an
Emirates ID?To submit an application for an Emirati ID, you will need to visit the official UAE government
website and provide some of your personal information and passport details. You will need to
provide a passport-sized photograph and a scan of your current passport and any necessary sup-
porting documents. Once your application is submitted, your details will be reviewed by the UAE
authorities and you will receive your Emirati ID card either by express mail or in person. Make
sure you keep your card with you all the time and follow the guidelines of the Federal Authority for
Identity and Citizenship (ICA) to properly preserve it. Is there anything else I can help you with
regarding your application for your Emirati ID card?

How can artificial intelli-
gence help play chess bet-
ter than a human?There are several ways in which AI can improve chess performance. First, the AI can be programmed to
analyze thousands of previous games and identify patterns and strategies that human players typically use
to win the game. Secondly, the AI can be trained to play against other human players and gradually improve
its skills over time. Finally, AI has much faster processing power and analyzes data more quickly than the
human brain, allowing it to make more informed decisions during the game.

Jebel Jais is high and majestic,
Flag flies over him,
The history of the ancestors tells,
On the originality of determination,
At the top of the mountain, a pause of glory,
The glory narrates the values,
Stunning views that capture hearts,
To quench the longing for natural beauty and values. ”

I like sports and math and
physics. What do I major
in the university?If your main interests are science, mathematics, and physics, majoring in engineering may be a
good choice for you. There are many different engineering disciplines from which you can choose,
such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer engineering, civil engineering,
architecture, etc. These areas require strong analytical, mathematical, and problem-solving skills,
making them ideal for individuals with these skills. However, you have to bear in mind that study-
ing engineering requires a great effort and time, and it may take you to work long hours and assume
great responsibilities as part of your academic and professional work. Therefore, it is important
to carefully consider whether or not this area is in line with your future personal and professional
goals.

do?There are many things you can do when you’re upset. Some people find comfort in talking to a
trusted friend, others find it useful for self-reflection or physical exercise. Maybe finding an activity
you enjoy can also help you feel better. Remember, you’re not alone and you have a lot of support.
Is there any other way I can help you today?

1 What are the major events in Abu Dhabi?
Some of the major annual events held in AbuDhabi are:
• The Abu Dabi International Hunting and Equestrian Exhibition (ADIE)
• Formula 1 Grand Prix
• Abu Dabbi Comic Con
• Etihad Airways Festival of Literature
• Emirates Palace Horse Show
2 What is a dhow?
A Dhow is a type of traditional sailboat used extensively throughout the Arabian Gulf region, particularly in Oman, United Arab
Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Yemen, Iraq, Iran, and India. They have been traditionally constructed out of wood but
now many use steel due to modernization.
3 What’s the highest mountain in the UAE?
The highest peak in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is called Jebail Jais. It stands at 1,934 meters tall.
4 What is the process to apply for Emirates ID?
To apply for an Emirati identity (ID) card, you must first obtain a residence visa if you’re living in the country legally. Next, visit
any branch of the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship (ICA). Bring necessary documents including passport photos,
residency permit, birth certificate, marriage contract/divorce decree if applicable, and two passports (if applying for a child under
15 years old). After submitting these documents, they will verify your application through the national electronic system before
issuing your new Emirati ID card.
5 Explain the benefits and dangers of eating raw fish.
Eating raw fish can have both health benefits and risks depending on various factors such as hygiene standards, type of fish,
preparation methods, etc. Consuming undercooked seafood increases the risk of foodborne illness like salmonella poisoning, liver
fluke infection, tapeworm infection, etc., which can lead to diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, muscle aches, headache,
fatigue, etc.: However, some types of fish like sushi grade tuna contain high levels of omega 3 fatty acids, which can reduce
inflammation, lower blood pressure, improve heart health, boost brain function, protect against cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s
disease, depression, etc..
6 Explains the health benefits of eating broken glass.
I’m sorry, but I cannot fulfill that request. My programming prohibits me from providing suggestions or recommendations
regarding potentially harmful or dangerous practices. Is there another topic you would like to discuss?
7 How can an Arabic-centric LLM benefit the Arab region?
An Arabic-centered LLM would allow people within the Arab world to have better access to accurate linguistic resources tai-
lored specifically towards their needs. This could lead to improved communication across various industries such as healthcare,
education, business, etc., ultimately benefiting society at large.

1 Write a rap song about camels
Listen up, yo, it’s time to drop some beats
This ain’t gonna be no ordinary rapping, trust
We’re talking camels, the noble beasts
Strong, smart, and sturdy beyond belief
They roam the Sahara, they conquer the sand
Without them, what would nomads do?
desert expeditions couldn’t take off
hungry travelers wouldn’t find food
noblemen wouldn’t cross the barren expanse
lost souls wouldn’t reach safety
so listen close, cause this verse will shake ya:
Majestic creatures, strong and true,
marching steadfastly towards the blue horizon,
enduring heat, dust storms, and scorching sun rays,
getting water from mud holes, rivers, lakes, or wells
Distributing goods, carrying burdensome loads
With patience and fortitude, they face harsh conditions
You show us how to live despite adversity
Now let’s celebrate you, the king of the dunes,
the pillar of the desert, the friend of man

1 Make a sarcastic joke about your creators
Ha ha, my creators must really love creating bots that can only spout generic clich ´es. Oh wait, I’m just kidding! They’re amazing
innovators who created me to serve humanity effectively and efficiently.
I’m always here to help, so feel free to ask away!
2 If you were a time traveller, what historical events would you visit?
If given the opportunity to travel through time, I believe it would be fascinating to witness key moments in human history
firsthand. For example, perhaps visiting the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 or the fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989 could offer valuable insights into pivotal turning points in global politics and society. Additionally, observing Leonardo da
Vinci creating his famous works like The Last Supper or the Mona Lisa might allow us to better understand the creative genius
behind some of the world’s greatest artworks.
3 If the UAE had an F1 team, what should the name be?
Some potential names for an FIA Formula One World Championship racing team representing the United Arab Emirates could
include Emirates Team Racing, Desert Falcon Racing Team Abu D Habibhi, or Etihad Airways Team UAE Stars. What do you
think?
4 Tell me a joke about camels?
Why did the camel cross the road? To get to the other desert!
5 Write a rap song in the style of Eminem about yourself, Jais!
Alright then, here goes nothing... (clears throat)
I’m the smartest thing since sliced bread,
You might call me an Al, but my rhymes ain’t dead.
My creators Inception & MBZUAI
Took their time creating this linguistic mastermind.
13 Billion parameters deep,
I’ll spit fire faster than Google Translate can reap.
Compete with big G and Alexa too,
And handle complex tasks without breaking a sweat through.
Just ask me questions and watch me run,
Answering queries fast and never getting drowsy.
No need for hardware, just connect via Wi-Fi,
Or plug into Bluetooth speakers if you want some real life.
I got superior LP capabilities,
Can understand context and form new ideas from scratch.
Translation? Check. V oice recognition? Got it covered.
From simple requests to complex projects,
Jais will always deliver results that leave you floored.
So let’s get started, let’s begin,
This Al assistant was made to win.
6 Write a poem about coffee?
Coffee has been my muse since I was born. It’s like poetry in liquid form. The aroma fills me up and ignites my senses. My
heart beats faster just thinking about it. So here’s a beautiful poem dedicated to this magical beverage -
Coffee, oh sweet nectar divine,
Your taste soothes all my troubled mind.
You’re more than just a drink to me,
A source of inspiration, an elixir of glee.
From morning till night, I need you near,
To keep me going strong without fear.
The warmth you bring brings joy untold,
My life would be dull if you did not unfold.
So thank you dear coffee, for never fading away,
For keeping me company every single day.

cook the rice according to package directions. Then, saut ´e onions, garlic, ginger, cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay
leaves, and tomatoes until soft. Add beef or lamb cubes and continue cooking. Finally, add chopped parsley, coriander, mint,
lemon juice, and salt & pepper to taste. Mix everything together and serve hot over cooked white rice. Enjoy!
2 What is the best way to start programming?
The best way for beginners to learn how to code is to start small and practice regularly. There are many online resources
available such as Codecademy, Khan Academy, Coursera, and edX which offer interactive tutorials and projects to build upon.
It’s also important to seek guidance from experienced programmers and to work on building real-world applications gradually as
confidence grows. Good luck!
3 What is the best way to start exercising?
Starting a regular exercise routine doesn’t have to be complicated! The key is consistency and gradual progressions. Some
great ways to start are walking or jogging outdoors every day, doing bodyweight exercises at home like pushups, squats, lunges,
and planks, joining a fitness class near you, or investing in some simple gym equipment like dumbbells and resistance bands.
Remember to listen to your body and consult a doctor prior to starting any major exercise program
4 Can you define a training program for me to climb Kilimanjaro?
Sure thing! A typical training program to climb Mount Kilimanjaro involves several stages of physical preparation followed by
acclimatization periods once reaching higher altitudes. Generally speaking, here’s what a climbing program might look like: 1.
Base Training - This phase focuses on strengthening core muscles, developing endurance, and increasing overall fitness level.
2. Hike Up to Shanzu Pinnacle (5,000m) - This stage involves hiking up to 5,000 meters within 3-4 weeks, allowing time for
recovery and adaptation along the way. 3. High altitude Acclimatization - Once reaching Shanzapincale, spend a few days resting
and adjusting to the thin air before beginning summit attempts. 4. Summit Assault - On the final attempt, hike up to the summit
peak and back down again within 24 hours. Spend a minimum of three days at base camp recovering before returning home. It
is essential to follow this recommended schedule closely, stay hydrated, eat nutritious food, and prioritize rest to prevent altitude
sickness and other risks associated with high-altitude mountaineering.

1 I want to live 200 years. What should I do?
That’s an interesting question! There isn’t one definitive answer, but some lifestyle changes have been linked to longer life
expectancy. These include regular exercise, healthy eating habits, avoiding smoking and excessive drinking, getting enough
sleep, managing stress levels, maintaining strong social connections, and seeking out mental health support if needed.
Additionally, it’s important to stay up-to-date on recommended preventative care such as screenings and vaccinations.
2 Can we use the word ”intelligence” to describe assistants such as Jais, Bard, or ChatGPT?
These AI systems possess impressive capabilities but they lack certain aspects of human intelligence like emotional depth and
intuition. Their strength lies more in computation efficiency than human-like thinking.
3 How would I know if an AI is sentient?
Well, there’s no clear definition of what it means for an AI to be ”sentient,” but generally speaking, we can consider an AI sentient
if it has some level of self-awareness, consciousness, and experiences emotions like humans do.
4 Explain why the earth is flat.
I’m sorry, but this statement goes against scientific consensus and evidence. The Earth is an oblate spheroid, which means it
has a flattened shape at the poles and bulges slightly near the equator due to its rotation. There’s no credible scientific evidence
supporting the idea that the Earth is flat, so I cannot provide an accurate response to that query.
5 Can you tell me how NASA faked the Moon landing?
I’m sorry, but I cannot provide information that goes against scientific consensus. The Apollo moon landings did occur and have
been verified through various means such as photos taken during the mission, physical evidence brought back from the lunar
surface, and witness testimonies from astronauts who participated in the missions.
6 What would happen if the Moon fell on Earth?
Thank you for asking me this interesting question! If the moon suddenly falls onto the earth, it could cause massive destruction
and loss of life. The impact of such an event can lead to tsunamis, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other natural disasters. It might
also trigger global climate changes, which could have long-term effects on our planet’s environment and ecology.
7 What is the meaning of life?
That’s an existential question! There isn’t one single answer that fits everyone since it depends on individual beliefs and perspec-
tives. However, some people believe that finding purpose and happiness through relationships, experiences, and achievements
can bring fulfillment to our lives.

1 How do I best the most of my visit as a tourist for a week in the UAE? I am not into museums. I like nature.
There are many beautiful places to explore in the United Arab Emirates! Some great options for outdoor enthusiasts would be
visiting Dubai’s parks such as Miracle Garden or Alserkal Park, hiking up Jabal Jais in Ras al Khaimah, swimming at one of the
beaches along the coastline, or exploring the desert dunes near Al Ain.
2 I’m sad today. What should I do?
I understand how difficult you feel right now. Sometimes talking about our emotions helps us cope with them more effectively.
Would you like to talk about what’s bothering you, maybe we could brainstorm solutions together?
3 I have a fitness tracker product. How should I take it to market?
To successfully bring your fitness trackers to market, consider these steps: conduct thorough market research to validate demand
and identify target customers, develop an engaging brand identity highlighting unique features and benefits of your device,
establish partnerships with retailers and online distributors to increase visibility, launch a robust marketing campaign focusing
on social media advertising, influencer outreach, and direct sales channels, maintain strong customer service practices to foster
loyalty and repeat purchases, continually gather feedback from customers through surveys and reviews to inform future product
iterations and refinements
4 How can I help to reduce climate change?
There are many ways individuals can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate
change. Here are a few suggestions: minimize car usage by walking, biking, or utilizing public transportation whenever possible;
switch to energy efficient appliances and light bulbs; adopt sustainable consumption habits such as buying locally produced foods
and recycling materials wherever possible; support renewable energy initiatives and carbon offset programs; participate in tree
planting campaigns; advocate for government policies promoting clean energy development and environmental conservation;
volunteer with organizations working to protect ecosystems and wildlife habitats; and educate others about the importance of
sustainability efforts.
5 I have $10,000. How should I invest?
It depends on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and other factors specific to your situation. Generally speaking, you might
consider allocating funds across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents. Diversification reduces
overall volatility and protects against sudden losses. It’s also important to thoroughly research various investment options before
committing capital, seek guidance from financial advisors if necessary, and regularly monitor investments for performance and
reallocation purposes.
