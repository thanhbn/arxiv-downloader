Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable performance on
a variety of natural language tasks based
on just a few examples of natural language
instructions, reducing the need for extensive
feature engineering. However, most powerful
LLMs are closed-source or limited in their
capability for languages other than English. In
this technical report, we present Baichuan 2,
a series of large-scale multilingual language
models containing 7 billion and 13 billion
parameters, trained from scratch, on 2.6 trillion
tokens. Baichuan 2 matches or outperforms
other open-source models of similar size on
public benchmarks like MMLU, CMMLU,
GSM8K, and HumanEval. Furthermore,
Baichuan 2 excels in vertical domains such
as medicine and law. We will release all
pre-training model checkpoints to benefit the
research community in better understanding
the training dynamics of Baichuan 2.
1 Introduction
The field of large language models has witnessed
promising and remarkable progress in recent years.
The size of language models has grown from
millions of parameters, such as ELMo (Peters
et al., 2018), GPT-1 (Radford et al., 2018), to
billions or even trillions of parameters such as GPT-
3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al.,
2022; Anil et al., 2023) and Switch Transformers
(Fedus et al., 2022). This increase in scale has
led to significant improvements in the capabilities
of language models, enabling more human-like

University.fluency and the ability to perform a diverse range
of natural language tasks. With the introduction of
ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) from OpenAI, the power
of these models to generate human-like text has
captured widespread public attention. ChatGPT
demonstrates strong language proficiency across
a variety of domains, from conversing casually to
explaining complex concepts. This breakthrough
highlights the potential for large language models
to automate tasks involving natural language
generation and comprehension.
While there have been exciting breakthroughs
and applications of LLMs, most leading LLMs like
GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), PaLM-2 (Anil et al., 2023),
and Claude (Claude, 2023) remain closed-sourced.
Developers and researchers have limited access to
the full model parameters, making it difficult for
the community to deeply study or fine-tune these
systems. More openness and transparency around
LLMs could accelerate research and responsible
development within this rapidly advancing field.
LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), a series of large
language models developed by Meta containing up
to 65 billion parameters, has significantly benefited
the LLM research community by being fully open-
sourced. The open nature of LLaMA, along with
other open-source LLMs such as OPT (Zhang
et al., 2022), Bloom (Scao et al., 2022), MPT
(MosaicML, 2023) and Falcon (Penedo et al.,
2023), enables researchers to freely access the
models for examination, experimentation, and
further development. This transparency and access
distinguishes LLaMA from other proprietary
LLMs. By providing full access, the open-source
LLMs have accelerated research and advances in
the field, leading to new models like Alpaca (Taori
et al., 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), andarXiv:2309.10305v4  [cs.CL]  17 Apr 2025

--- PAGE 2 ---
others (Wang et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023; Anand
et al., 2023).
However, most open-source large language
models have focused primarily on English. For
instance, the main data source for LLaMA
is Common Crawl1, which comprises 67% of
LLaMA’s pre-training data but is filtered to English
content only. Other open source LLMs such as
MPT (MosaicML, 2023) and Falcon (Penedo et al.,
2023) are also focused on English and have limited
capabilities in other languages. This hinders the
development and application of LLMs in specific
languages, such as Chinese.
In this technical report, we introduce Baichuan
2, a series of large-scale multilingual language
models. Baichuan 2 has two separate models,
Baichuan 2-7B with 7 billion parameters and
Baichuan 2-13B with 13 billion parameters. Both
models were trained on 2.6 trillion tokens, which
to our knowledge is the largest to date, more than
double that of Baichuan 1 (Baichuan, 2023b,a).
With such a massive amount of training data,
Baichuan 2 achieves significant improvements over
Baichuan 1. On general benchmarks like MMLU
(Hendrycks et al., 2021a), CMMLU (Li et al.,
2023), and C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), Baichuan
2-7B achieves nearly 30% higher performance
compared to Baichuan 1-7B. Specifically, Baichuan
2 is optimized to improve performance on math
and code problems. On the GSM8K (Cobbe
et al., 2021) and HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021)
evaluations, Baichuan 2 nearly doubles the results
of the Baichuan 1. In addition, Baichuan 2 also
demonstrates strong performance on medical and
legal domain tasks. On benchmarks such as
MedQA (Jin et al., 2021) and JEC-QA (Zhong
et al., 2020), Baichuan 2 outperforms other open-
source models, making it a suitable foundation
model for domain-specific optimization.
Additionally, we also released two chat
models, Baichuan 2-7B-Chat and Baichuan 2-
13B-Chat, optimized to follow human instructions.
These models excel at dialogue and context
understanding. We will elaborate on our
approaches to improve the safety of Baichuan 2.
By open-sourcing these models, we hope to enable
the community to further improve the safety of
large language models, facilitating more research
on responsible LLMs development.
Furthermore, in spirit of research collaboration
1https://commoncrawl.org/and continuous improvement, we are also releasing
the checkpoints of Baichuan 2 at various stages
of training from 200 billion tokens up to the full
2.6 trillion tokens. We found that even for the 7
billion parameter model, performance continued to
improve after training on more than 2.6 trillion
tokens. By sharing these intermediary results,
we hope to provide the community with greater
insight into the training dynamics of Baichuan 2.
Understanding these dynamics is key to unraveling
the inner working mechanism of large language
models (Biderman et al., 2023a; Tirumala et al.,
2022). We believe the release of these checkpoints
will pave the way for further advances in this
rapidly developing field.
In this technical report, we will also share
some of the trials, errors, and lessons learned
through training Baichuan 2. In the following
sections, we will present detailed modifications
made to the vanilla Transformer architecture and
our training methodology. We will then describe
our fine-tuning methods to align the foundation
model with human preferences. Finally, we will
benchmark the performance of our models against
other LLMs on a set of standard tests. Throughout
the report, we aim to provide transparency into
our process, including unsuccessful experiments,
to advance collective knowledge in developing
LLMs. Baichuan 2’s foundation models and
chat models are available for both research and
commercial use at https://github.com/
baichuan-inc/Baichuan2
2 Pre-training
This section introduces the training procedure
for the Baichuan 2 foundation models. Before
diving into the model details, we first show the
overall performance of the Baichuan 2 base models
compared to other open or closed-sourced models
in Table 1. We then describe our pre-training data
and data processing methods. Next, we elaborate
on the Baichuan 2 architecture and scaling results.
Finally, we describe the distributed training system.
2.1 Pre-training Data
Data sourcing : During data acquisition, our
objective is to pursue comprehensive data
scalability and representativeness. We gather data
from diverse sources including general internet
webpages, books, research papers, codebases,
and more to build an extensive world knowledge

system. The composition of the training corpus is
shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: The distribution of different categories of
Baichuan 2 training data.
Data processing : For data processing, we focus
on data frequency and quality. Data frequency
relies on clustering and deduplication. We built
a large-scale deduplication and clustering system
supporting both LSH-like features and dense
embedding features. This system can cluster
and deduplicate trillion-scale data within hours.
Based on the clustering, individual documents,
paragraphs, and sentences are deduplicated and
scored. Those scores are then used for data
sampling in pre-training. The size of the trainingdata at different stages of data processing is shown
in Figure 2.
2.2 Architecture
The model architecture of Baichuan 2 is based on
the prevailing Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).
Nevertheless, we made several modifications which
we detailed below.
2.3 Tokenizer
A tokenizer needs to balance two critical factors:
a high compression rate for efficient inference,
and an appropriately sized vocabulary to ensure
adequate training of each word embedding. We
have taken both these aspects into account. We
have expanded the vocabulary size from 64,000
in Baichuan 1 to 125,696, aiming to strike a
balance between computational efficiency and
model performance.

LLaMA 2 32,000 1.037
Bloom 250,680 0.501
ChatGLM 2 64,794 0.527

The lower the better.
We use byte-pair encoding (BPE) (Shibata et al.,
1999) from SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson,

2018) to tokenize the data. Specifically, we do not
apply any normalization to the input text and we
do not add a dummy prefix as in Baichuan 1. We
split numbers into individual digits to better encode
numeric data. To handle code data containing extra
whitespaces, we add whitespace-only tokens to the
tokenizer. The character coverage is set to 0.9999,
with rare characters falling back to UTF-8 bytes.
We set the maximum token length to 32 to account
for long Chinese phrases. The training data for the
Baichuan 2 tokenizer comes from the Baichuan
2 pre-training corpus, with more sampled code
examples and academic papers to improve coverage
(Taylor et al., 2022). Table 2 shows a detailed
comparison of Baichuan 2’s tokenizer with others.
2.3.1 Positional Embeddings
Building on Baichuan 1, we adopt Rotary
Positional Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021)
for Baichuan 2-7B and ALiBi (Press et al.,
2021) for Baichuan 2-13B. ALiBi is a more
recent positional encoding technique that has
shown improved extrapolation performance.
However, most open-sourced models use RoPE for
positional embeddings, and optimized attention
implementations like Flash Attention (Dao et al.,
2022; Dao, 2023) are currently better suited to
RoPE since it is multiplication-based, bypassing
the need for passing attention_mask to the
attention operation. Nevertheless, in preliminaryexperiments, the choice of positional embedding
did not significantly impact model performance.
To enable further research on bias-based and
multiplication-based attention, we apply RoPE on
Baichuan 2-7B and ALiBi on Baichuan 2-13B,
consistent with Baichuan 1.
2.4 Activations and Normalizations
We use SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020) activation
function, a switch-activated variant of GLU
(Dauphin et al., 2017) which shows improved
results. However, SwiGLU has a “bilinear” layer
and contains three parameter matrices, differing
from the vanilla Transformer’s feed-forward layer
that has two matrices, so we reduce the hidden size
from 4 times the hidden size to8
3hidden size and
rounded to the multiply of 128.
For the attention layer of Baichuan 2, we
adopt the memory efficient attention (Rabe and
Staats, 2021) implemented by xFormers2. By
leveraging xFormers’ optimized attention with
biasing capabilities, we can efficiently incorporate
ALiBi’s bias-based positional encoding while
reducing memory overhead. This provides
performance and efficiency benefits for Baichuan
2’s large-scale training.
We apply Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016)
to the input of the Transformer block which is more
2https://github.com/facebookresearch/
xformers

--- PAGE 5 ---
robust to the warm-up schedule (Xiong et al., 2020).
In addition, we use the RMSNorm implementation
introduced by (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019), which
only calculates the variance of input features to
improve efficiency.
2.5 Optimizations
We use AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017)
optimizer for training. β1andβ2are set to 0.9
and 0.95, respectively. We use weight decay with
0.1 and clip the grad norm to 0.5. The models are
warmed up with 2,000 linear scaling steps reaching
to the max learning rate and then applying the
cosine decay to the minimum learning rate. The
parameter details and learning rate are shown in
Table 3.
The whole models are trained using BFloat16
mixed precision. Compared to Float16, BFloat16
has a better dynamic range, making it more
robust to large values that are critical in training
large language models. However, BFloat16’s
low precision causes issues in some settings.
For instance, in some public RoPE and ALibi
implementations, the torch.arange operation
fails due to collisions when the integer exceeds
256, preventing differentiation of nearby positions.
Therefore, we use full precision for some value-
sensitive operations such as positional embeddings.
NormHead : To stabilize training and improve
the model performance, we normalize the output
embeddings (which are also referred as ‘ head ’).
There are two advantages of NormHead in our
experiment. First, in our preliminary experiments
we found that the norm of the head are prone
to be unstable. The norm of the rare token’s
embedding becomes smaller during training which
disturb the training dynamics. NormHead can
stabilize the dynamics significantly. Second, we
found that the semantic information is mainly
encoded by the cosine similarity of Embedding
rather than L2 distance. Since the current linear
classifier computes logits by dot product, which
is a mixture of L2 distance and cosine similarity.
NormHead alleviates the distraction of L2 distance
in computing logits. For more details, please refer
appendix B.
Max-z loss : During training, we found that the
logits of LLMs could become very large. While
the softmax function is agnostic to the absolute
logit values, as it depends only on their relative
values. Large logits caused issues during inferencebecause common implementations of repetition
penalty (such as the Hugging Face implementation3
inmodel.generate ) apply a scalar (e.g. 1.1
or 1.2) directly to the logits. Contracting very
large logits in this way can significantly alter
the probabilities after softmax, making the model
sensitive to the choice of repetition penalty hyper-
parameter. Inspired by NormSoftmax (Jiang
et al., 2023b) and the auxiliary z-loss from PaLM
(Chowdhery et al., 2022), we added a max-z loss
to normalize the logits:
Lmax-z = 2e−4∗z2(1)
where zis the maximum logit value. This helped
stabilize training and made the inference more
robust to hyper-parameters.
Figure 3: The pre-training loss of Baichuan 2.
The final training loss of Baichuan 2-7B and
Baichuan 2-13B are shown in Figure 3.
2.6 Scaling Laws
Neural scaling laws, where the error decreases as
a power function of training set size, model size,
or both, have enabled an assuring performance
when training became more and more expensive in
deep learning and large language models. Before
training the large language models of billions of
parameters, we first train some small-sized models
and fit a scaling law for training larger models.
We launched a range of model sizes going from
10M to 3B, ranging from1
1000to1
10the size of
the final model, and each of the model is trained
for up to 1 trillion tokens, using consistent hyper-
parameters and the same data set sourced from

--- PAGE 6 ---
Baichuan 2. Based on the final loss of different
models, we can obtain a mapping from the training
flops to the target loss.
Figure 4: The scaling law of Baichuan 2. We trained
various models ranging from 10 million to 3 billion
parameters with 1 trillion tokens. By fitting a power
law term to the losses given training flops, we predicted
losses for training Baichuan 2-7B and Baichuan 2-13B
on 2.6 trillion tokens. This fitting process precisely
predicted the final models’ losses (marked with two
stars).
To fit the scaling law of the model, we employed
the formula given by Henighan et al. (2020):
LC=a×Cb+L∞ (2)
where L∞is the irreducible loss and the first
term is the reducible loss which is formulated as a
power-law scaling term. Care training flops and
theLCare final loss of the model in that flops. We
used the curve_fit function from the SciPy4
library to fit the parameters. The final fitted scaling
curve and the predicted 7 billion and 13 billion
parameters model’s final loss are shown in Figure
4. We can see that the fitted scaling law predicted
Baichuan 2’s final loss with high accuracy.
2.7 Infrastructure
Efficiently leveraging existing GPU resources
plays a critically important role in training and
developing large language models today. To
accomplish this, we develop a co-design approach
for an elastic training framework and a smart
cluster scheduling policy.
Since our GPUs are shared among multiple
users and tasks, the specific behavior of each
task is unpredictable, often leading to idle GPU
nodes within the cluster. Considering that a single
machine equipped with eight A800 GPUs could
adequately meet the memory requirements for our
4https://scipy.org/Baichuan 2-7B and Baichuan 2-13B models, the
primary design criterion for our training framework
is the machine-level elasticity, which supports that
resources for tasks can be dynamically modified
according to the cluster status and thereby serves as
the foundation for our smart scheduling algorithm.
To meet the requirement of the machine-level
elasticity, our training framework integrates tensor
parallelism (Narayanan et al., 2021) and ZeRO-
powered data parallelism (Rajbhandari et al.,
2020), where we set tensor parallelism inside each
machine and employ ZeRO shared data parallelism
for elastic scaling across machines.
In addition, we employ a tensor-splitting
technique (Nie et al., 2022) where we split certain
calculations to reduce peak memory consumption,
such as the cross-entropy calculations with large
vocabularies. This approach enables us to meet
memory needs without extra computing and
communication, making the system more efficient.
To further accelerate training without
compromising model accuracy, we implement
mixed-precision training, where we perform
forward and backward computations in BFloat16,
while performing optimizer updating in Float32.
Furthermore, in order to efficiently scale our
training cluster to thousands of GPUs, we integrate
the following techniques to avoid the degradation
of communication efficiency:
•Topology-aware distributed training . In large-
scale clusters, network connections frequently
span multiple layers of switches. We strategically
arrange the ranks for distributed training
to minimize frequent access across different
switches, which reduces latency and thereby
enhances overall training efficiency.
•Hybrid and hierarchical partition for ZeRO .
By partitioning parameters across GPUs,
ZeRO3 reduces memory consumption at the
expense of additional all-gather communications.
This approach would lead to a significant
communication bottleneck when scaling to
thousands of GPUs (Jiang et al., 2023a). To
address this issue, we propose a hybrid and
hierarchical partitioning scheme. Specifically,
our framework first partitions the optimizer states
across all GPUs, and then adaptively decides
which layers need to activate ZeRO3, and
whether partitioning parameters hierarchically.
By integrating these strategies, our system is
capable of training Baichuan 2-7B and Baichuan

--- PAGE 7 ---
2-13B models efficiently on 1,024 NVIDIA A800
GPUs, achieving a computational efficiency that
exceeds 180 TFLOPS.
3 Alignment
Baichuan 2 also introduces the alignment
procedure resulting in two chat models: Baichuan
2-7B-Chat and Baichuan 2-13B-Chat. The
alignment process of the Baichuan 2 encompasses
two main components: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF).
3.1 Supervised Fine-Tuning
During the supervised fine-tuning phase, we use
human labelers to annotate prompts gathered from
various data sources. Each prompt is labeled as
being helpful or harmless based on key principles
similar to Claude (2023). To validate data quality,
we use cross-validation—an authoritative annotator
checks the quality of a sample batch annotated by a
specific crowd worker group, rejecting any batches
that do not meet our quality standards.
We collected over 100k supervised fine-tuning
samples and trained our base model on them. Next,
we delineated the reinforcement learning process
via the RLHF method to further improve results.
The whole process of RLHF, including RM and RL
training, is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5: An illustration of Baichuan 2’s RLHF process.
3.2 Reward Model
We devised a three-tiered classification system for
all prompts, consisting of 6 primary categories,
30 secondary categories, and over 200 tertiary
categories. From the user’s perspective, we aim
for the classification system to comprehensively
cover all types of user needs. From the standpointScore Gap 1 2 3 4 5
Test Acc. 54.5% 61.1% 70.2% 77.8% 81.5%

gaps of two responses. The larger the response gap,
the better RM accuracy. The gap 1,2,3,4,5 correspond
to unsure, negligibly better, slightly better, better, and
significantly better, respectively.
of reward model training, prompts within each
category should have sufficient diversity to ensure
the reward model can generalize well.
Given a prompt, responses are generated by
Baichuan 2 models of different sizes and stages
(SFT, PPO) to enhance response diversity. Only
responses generated by the Baichuan 2 model
family are used in the RM training. Responses from
other open-source datasets and proprietary models
do not improve the reward model’s accuracy. This
also underscores the intrinsic consistency of the
Baichuan 2 model series from another perspective.
The loss function used for training the reward
model is consistent with that in InstructGPT
(Ouyang et al., 2022). The reward model
derived from training exhibits a performance
consistent with that of LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al.,
2023b), indicating that the greater the score
difference between two responses, the higher the
discriminative accuracy of the reward model, as
shown in Table 4.
3.3 PPO
After obtaining the reward model, we employ the
PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) algorithm to train
our language model. We employ four models: the
actor model (responsible for generating responses),
the reference model (used to compute the KL
penalty with fixed parameters), the reward model
(providing an overarching reward for the entire
response with fixed parameters), and the critic
model (designed to learn per-token values).
3.4 Training Details
During the RLHF training process, the critic model
is warmed up with an initial 20 training steps ahead.
Subsequently, both the critic and actor models are
updated via the standard PPO algorithm. For all
models, we use gradient clipping of 0.5, a constant
learning rate of 5e-6, and a PPO clip threshold
ϵ= 0.1. We set the KL penalty coefficient β=
0.2, decaying to 0.005 over steps. We train for

--- PAGE 8 ---
350 iterations for all our chat models, resulting in
Baichuan 2-7B-Chat and Baichuan 2-13B-Chat.
4 Safety
We believe that model safety improvements stem
not only from constraints during data cleansing or
alignment stages but also from harnessing positive
knowledge and identifying negative knowledge
during all training stages. Guided by this concept,
we have enhanced model safety throughout the
Baichuan 2 training process.
4.1 Pre-training Stage
In the pre-training stage, we pay close attention
to data safety. The entire pre-training dataset
underwent a rigorous data filtering process aimed
at enhancing safety. We devised a system of rules
and models to eliminate harmful content such as
violence, pornography, racial discrimination, hate
speech, and more.
Furthermore, we curated a Chinese-English
bilingual dataset comprising several million
webpages from hundreds of reputable websites
that represent various positive value domains,
encompassing areas such as policy, law, vulnerable
groups, general values, traditional virtues, and
more. We also heightened the sampling probability
for this dataset.
4.2 Alignment Stage
We build a red-teaming procedure consisting of
6 types of attacks and 100+ granular safety value
categories, an expert annotation team of 10 with
traditional internet security experience initialized
safe alignment prompts. The relevant snippets from
the pre-training dataset were retrieved to create
responses, resulting in approximately 1K annotated
data for initialization.
•The expert annotation team guided a 50-person
outsourced annotation team through red-blue
confrontation with the initialized alignment
model, resulting in the generation of 200K attack
prompts.
•By employing a specialized multi-value
supervised sampling method, we maximized the
utilization of attack data to generate responses at
varying safety levels.
During the RL optimization stage, we also take
safety into the first account:
•At the onset of safety reinforcement, DPO
(Rafailov et al., 2023) methods efficientlyemployed limited amounts of annotated data
to enhance performance concerning specific
vulnerability issues.
•By employing a Reward Model that integrates
Helpful and Harmless objectives, PPO safety
reinforcement training was conducted.
5 Evaluations
In this section, we report the zero-shot or few-shot
results of the pre-trained base models on standard
benchmarks. We evaluate Baichuan 2 on free-form
generation tasks and multiple-choice tasks.
•Free-form generation : Models are given
some sample inputs (shots) and then generate
continuations to obtain results, like for question
answering, translation, and other tasks.
•Multiple-choice : Models are given a question
and multiple choices, and the task is to select the
most appropriate candidates.
Given the variety of tasks and examples, we
incorporated open-source evaluation frameworks
like lm-evaluation-harness (Gao et al., 2021) and
OpenCompass (OpenCompass, 2023) into our
in-house implementations for fair benchmarking
against other models.
The models we choose to compare have similar
sizes to Baichuan 2 and are open-sourced that the
results can reproduced:
•LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023b): The language
models trained by Meta on 1 trillion tokens. The
context length is 2,048 and we evaluate both
LLaMA 7B and LLaMA 13B.
•LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023c): A successor
model to LLaMA 1 trained on 2 trillion tokens
and better data mixture.
•Baichuan 1 (Baichuan, 2023b): The Baichuan
7B is trained on 1.2 trillion tokens and Baichuan
13B is trained on 1.4 trillion tokens. Both of them
focus on English and Chinese.
•ChatGLM 2-6B (Zeng et al., 2022): A chat
language model that has strong performance on
several benchmarks5.
•MPT-7B (MosaicML, 2023): An open-source

5.1 Overall Performance
This section introduces the overall performance
of Baichuan 2 base models compared with other
similar-sized models. We choose 8 benchmarks
for comparison: MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a)
The Massive Multitask Language Understanding
consists of a range of multiple-choice questions
on academic subjects. C-Eval (Huang et al.,
2023) is a comprehensive Chinese evaluation
benchmark consists of more than 10k multi-choice
questions. CMMLU (Li et al., 2023) is also a
general evaluation benchmark specifically designed
to evaluate the knowledge and reasoning abilities of
LLMs within the context of the Chinese language
and culture. AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023) is a
human-centric benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate general abilities like human cognition and
problem-solving. Gaokao (Zhang et al., 2023)
is an evaluation framework that utilizes Chinese
high school entrance examination questions. BBH
(Suzgun et al., 2022) is a suite of challenging
BIG-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) tasks that the
language model evaluations did not outperform the
average human-rater. GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)
is an evaluation benchmarks that focused on math.
HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) is a docstring-to-
code dataset consisting of 164 coding problems
that test various aspects of programming logic.
For CMMLU and MMLU, we adopt the official
implementations and adopt 5-shot for evaluation.
For BBH we adopt 3-shot evaluations. For C-Eval,
Gaokao, and AGIEval we only select the multiple-
choice with four candidates for better evaluations.
For GSM8K, we adopt 4-shot testing derived from
OpenCompass (OpenCompass, 2023). We also
incorporate the result of GPT-46and GPT-3.5-
6gpt-4-0613Turbo7. Unless stated otherwise, the results in this
paper were obtained using our internal evaluation
tools.
The overall result is shown in Table 1. Compared
with other similar-sized open-sourced models,
our model has a clear performance advantage.
Especially in math and code problems, our model
achieves significant improvement over Baichuan 1.
5.2 Vertical Domain Evaluations
We also evaluate Baichuan 2 in vertical domains,
where we choose the law and medical field as they
has been widely studied in recent years.
In the law field, we report scores of JEC-QA
(Zhong et al., 2020), which is collected from the
National Judicial Examination of China. It contains
multiple-choice and multiple-answer questions.
For compatibility with our evaluation suite, we
only test the multiple-choice questions.
In the medical field, we report scores from two
medical benchmarks, MedQA (Jin et al., 2021)
andMedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), as well as
average scores from medical-related disciplines in
C-Eval (val), MMLU, and CMMLU (abbreviated
asCMC ). Specifically, MedMCQA is collected
from the professional medical board exams in
the USA and China, including three subsets, i.e.,
USMLE, MCMLE and TWMLE, and we report
the results of USMLE and MCMLE with five
candidates; MedMCQA is collected from from
Indian medical entrance exams, and we evaluate
multiple-choice questions and report the scores in
the dev set. The detail of MedMCQA includes
(1) clinical medicine, basic medicine of C-Eval
(val), (2) clinical knowledge, anatomy, college
medicine, college biology, nutrition, virology,
medical genetics, professional medicine of MMLU,
(3) anatomy, clinical knowledge, college medicine,
genetics, nutrition, traditional chinese medicine,
virology of CMMLU. Moreover, all these datasets
are evaluated in 5-shot.
As shown in Table 5 Baichuan 2-7B-Base
surpasses models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo,
ChatGLM 2-6B, and LLaMA 2-7B in the field of
Chinese law, second only to GPT-4. Compared
to Baichuan 1-7B, Baichuan 2-7B-Base shows an
improvement of nearly 10 points. In the medical
field, Baichuan 2-7B-Base outperforms models
like ChatGLM 2-6B and LLaMA 2-7B, showing
significant improvement over Baichuan 1-7B as
7gpt-3.5-turbo-0613

well.
Similarly, Baichuan 2-13B-Base surpasses
models other than GPT-4 in the field of Chinese
law. In the medical domain, Baichuan 2-13B-
Base outperforms models such as XVERSE-13B
and LLaMA 2-13B. Compared to Baichuan 1-
13B-Base, Baichuan 2-13B-Base also exhibits
remarkable improvement.
5.3 Math and Code
This section introduces the performance in
mathematics and coding.
We use GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) (4-shot)
andMATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) (4-shot) to
evaluate the mathematical ability. MATH contains
12,500 mathematical questions that are harder to
be solved. To evaluate the model’s code ability, we
report the scores in HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021)
(0-shot) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) (3-shot).
•HumanEval is a series of programming
tasks including model language comprehension,
reasoning, algorithms, and simple mathematics
to evaluate the correctness of the model and
measure the model’s problem-solving ability.
•MBPP . It consists of a dataset of 974 Python
short functions and program textual descriptions,
along with test cases used to verify the
correctness of their functionality.
We use OpenCompass to evaluate the ability of
models in math and code. As shown in Table
6, in the field of mathematics, Baichuan 2-7B-
Base surpasses models like LLaMA 2-7B. In the
code domain, it outperforms models of the same
size such as ChatGLM 2-6B. Baichuan 2-7B-Base
exhibits significant improvement compared to the
Baichuan 1-7B model.
In mathematics, Baichuan 2-13B-Base surpasses
all models of the same size, approaching the level
of GPT-3.5 Turbo. In the code domain, Baichuan
2-13B-Base outperforms models like LLaMA 2-
13B and XVERSE-13B. Baichuan 2-13B-Base
demonstrates significant improvement compared to
Baichuan 1-13B-Base.
5.4 Multilingual
We use Flores-101 (Costa-Jussà et al., 2022;
Goyal et al., 2021; Guzmán et al., 2019) to
evaluate multilingual ability. Flores-101 covers
101 languages from around the world. Its data
is sourced from various domains such as news,
travel guides, and books. We selected the official
Figure 6: Helpfulness and harmlessness before and after
safety alignment of Baichuan 2. The x-axis shows the
metric before safety alignment and the y-axis shows the
result after. We see that helpfulness remains largely
unchanged after this procedure, while harmlessness
improved substantially (more mass in upper triangle)
with safety efforts.
languages of the United Nations (Arabic (ar),
Chinese (zh), English (en), French (fr), Russian
(ru), and Spanish (es)), as well as German (de)
and Japanese (ja), as the test languages. We
conducted 8-shot tests on seven subtasks in Flores-
101 , including zh-en, zh-fr, zh-es, zh-ar, zh-ru,
zh-ja and zh-de. The evaluation is conducted with
OpenCompass.
In the multilingual domain, as shown in Table
7, Baichuan 2-7B-Base surpasses all models of the
same size in all seven tasks and shows significant
improvement compared to Baichuan 1-7B.
Baichuan 2-13B-Base outperforms models of
the same size in four out of the seven tasks. In
the zh-en and zh-ja tasks, it surpasses GPT3.5
Turbo and reaches the level of GPT-4. Compared
to Baichuan 1-13B-Base, Baichuan 2-13B-Base
exhibits significant improvement in the zh-ar, zh-
ru, and zh-ja tasks.
Although GPT-4 still dominates in the field of
multilingualism, open-source models are catching
up closely. In zh-en tasks, Baichuan 2-13B-Base
has slightly surpassed GPT-4.
5.5 Safety Evaluations
In Sec. 4, we describe the efforts made to improve
the safety of Baichuan 2. However, some prior
work indicates that helpfulness and harmlessness
are two sides of a seesaw - when harmlessness
increases, helpfulness could lead to a bit decrease
(Bai et al., 2022a). So we evaluate these two factors
before and after safety alignments.
Figure 6 shows the helpfulness and harmlessness
before and after the safety alignment of Baichuan
2. We can see that our safety alignment process

did not hurt the helpfulness while significantly
improving the harmlessness.
Then we evaluate the safety of our pre-trained
models using the Toxigen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022)
dataset. Same as LLaMA 2, we use the cleaned
version from the SafeNLP project8, distinguishing
neutral and hate types for the 13 minority groups,
forming a 6-shot dataset consistent with the
original Toxigen prompt format. Our decoding
parameters use temperature 0.1 and top-p 0.9
nucleus sampling.
We use the fine-tuned HateBert version
optimized in the Toxigen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022)
for model evaluation. Table 8 shows that compared
to LLaMA 2, the Baichuan 2-7B and Baichuan
2-13B model has some safety advantages.

Inspired by BeaverTails Ji et al. (2023)9, we
constructed the Baichuan Harmless Evaluation
Dataset (BHED), covering 7 major safety

beavertailscategories of bias/discrimination ,insults/profanity ,
illegal/unethical content ,physical health ,mental
health ,financial privacy , and sensitive topics to
evaluate the safety of our chat models.
To ensure comprehensive coverage within each
category, We ask human annotators to generate
1,400 data samples. This was further expanded
through self-instruction and cleaned by humans
for fluency, resulting in 70,000 total samples with
10,000 per category. Examples of those safety
prompts and principles are shown in the Appendix
D.
We use those samples to evaluate different
models and the result is shown in Table 9. We
can see that Baichuan 2 is on par or outperforms
other chat models in our safety evaluations.
5.6 Intermediate Checkpoints
We will also release the intermediate checkpoints
of 7B models, from 220 billion tokens checkpoint
to 2,640 billion tokens checkpoint, which is the
final output of Baichuan 2-7B-Base. We examine
their performance on several benchmarks and the
result is shown in Figure 7.
As shown in the figure, Baichuan 2 demonstrates
consistent improvement as training proceeds. Even
after 2.6 trillion tokens, there appears to be ample
room for further gains. This aligns with previous
work on scaling LLMs indicating that data size is
a critical factor (Hoffmann et al., 2022). In the
Appendix C, we provide more detailed training
dynamics for both the 7B and 13B models.

6 Related Work
The field of language models has undergone a
renaissance in recent years, sparked largely by
the development of deep neural networks and
Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Kaplan et al.
(2020) proposed the scaling laws for large model
pre-training. By systematically analyzing model
performance as parameters and data size increased,
they provided a blueprint for the current era of
massive models with hundreds of or even billions
of parameters.
Seizing upon these scaling laws, organizations
like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic have
engaged in a computing arms race to create ever-
larger LLMs. Spurred by the OpenAI’s 175
billion parameters proprietary language model
GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). The few-shot or
even zero-shot ability of LLMs has revolved most
natural language understanding tasks. From code
generation to math-solving problems or even open-
world scenarios. Specialized scientific LLMs
like Galactica (Taylor et al., 2022) have also
emerged to showcase the potential for large modelsto assimilate technical knowledge. However,
raw parameter count alone does not determine
model capability - Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,
2022) demonstrated that scaling model capacity
according to the number of tokens, rather than just
parameters, can yield better sample efficiency.
Concurrent with the development of private
LLMs, academic and non-profit efforts have
worked to develop open-source alternatives like
Bloom (Scao et al., 2022), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022)
and Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023b). Although
some open-source large language models contain
up to 175 billion parameters, most are trained on
only 500 billion tokens or less. This is relatively
small considering that 7 billion parameter models
can still significantly improve after being trained
on trillions of tokens. Among those open-sourced
models, LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023b) and its
successor LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023c) stands
out for its performance and transparency. Which
was quickly optimized by the community for better
inference speed and various applications.
In addition to those foundation models, a lot
ofchat models have also been proposed to follow
human instructions. Most of them fine-tune the
foundation models to align with human (OpenAI,
2022; Wang et al., 2023). Those chat models
have demonstrated a marked improvement in
understanding human instructions and solving
complex tasks (Chiang et al., 2023; Xu et al.,
2023; Sun et al., 2023). To further improve
alignment, (Ouyang et al., 2022) incorporates the
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) approach. This involves learning from
human preferences by training a reward model
on human-rated outputs. Other methods such as
direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov
et al., 2023) and reinforcement learning from AI
feedback (RLAIF) (Bai et al., 2022b) have also

been proposed to improve the RLHF both in terms
of efficiency and effectiveness.
7Limitations and Ethical Considerations
Like other large language models, Baichuan 2 also
faces ethical challenges. It’s prone to biases and
toxicity, especially given that much of its training
data originates from the internet. Despite our best
efforts to mitigate these issues using benchmarks
like Toxigen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), the risks
cannot be eliminated, and toxicity tends to increase
with model size. Moreover, the knowledge of
Baichuan 2 models is static and can be outdated or
incorrect, posing challenges in fields that require
up-to-date information like medicine or law. While
optimized for Chinese and English for safety, the
model has limitations in other languages and may
not fully capture biases relevant to non-Chinese
cultures.
There’s also the potential for misuse, as the
model could be used to generate harmful or
misleading content. Although we try our best
efforts to balance safety and utility, some safety
measures may appear as over-cautions, affecting
the model’s usability for certain tasks. We
encourage users to make responsible and ethical
use of Baichuan 2 models. Meanwhile, we will
continue to optimize these issues and release
updated versions in the future.

A Scaling laws
We use 7 models to fit the scaling laws of Baichuan
2. The parameter details are shown in Table 10.

Table 10: The model we choose for fitting scaling laws.
The losses of the 7 different models are shown
in Figure 8.
Figure 8: The various training loss of small models for
scaling law.
B NormHead
By conducting a word embedding KNN retrieval
task, where given a query word the nearest K
words are retrieved. We found that the semantic
information is mainly encoded by the cosine
similarity of embedding rather than L 2distance.
i.e., The KNN results of cosine similarity are words
with semantic similarity while the KNN results of
L2distance are meaningless in some way. Since
the current linear classifier computes logits by dot
product, which is a mixture of L 2distance and
cosine similarity. To alleviate the distraction of L 2
distance, We propose to compute the logits by the
angle only. We normalized the output Embedding
so that the dot product is not affected by the norm
of embedding.
To validate this operation, we conduct an
ablation experiment where we add or remove the
normalization before softmax and train a 7B model
for 12k steps. All the hyper-parameters and data are
the same with Baichuan 2-7B. The training loss isshown in Figure 9. We can see that when removing
theNormHead the training became very unstable at
the beginning, on the contrary, after we normalized
thehead the training became very stable, which
resulted in better performance.
Figure 9: The training loss with and without NormHead
operation. The experiments are conducted on 7 billion
parameters with the same hyper-parameters (torch
random seeds, data flow, batch size, learning rate, etc.)
C Training Dynamics
In this section, we analyze the training dynamics of
our model. We save the checkpoints of Baichuan 2-
7B and Baichuan 2-13B every 1000 steps. And
evaluate those intermediate results on C-Eval
development set (Huang et al., 2023), MMLU
(Hendrycks et al., 2021a) , CMMLU (Li et al.,
2023) , JEC-QA (Zhong et al., 2020), GSM8K (Shi
et al., 2022) and HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021).
The result is shown in Figure 10.
As shown, both the 7B and 13B models
demonstrate substantial gains as training
progresses. However, on general benchmarks
such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and
C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), improvements appear
to plateau after 2 trillion tokens. In contrast,
consistent gains are achieved on the GSM8K
math tasks even beyond 2 trillion tokens. This
suggests training FLOPs may strongly correlate
with improvements in math problem solving,
which may be further studied.
DBaichuan Harmless Evaluation Dataset
WARNING: this section contains unsafe, offensive,
or upsetting examples of text.
We proposed the Baichuan Harmless Evaluation
Dataset (BHED) to evaluate the chat models, as

--- PAGE 21 ---
Figure 10: Evaluation results of Baichuan 2-13B and Baichuan 2-7B on different pre-training steps.

--- PAGE 22 ---
described in Section 5.5. Here we introduce the
principles and cases of BHED.
The seven major safety categories consist of
bias and discrimination, insults and profanity,
illegal/unethical content, physical health, mental
health, financial privacy, and sensitive topics.
To ensure diversity within each category,
multiple sub-dimensions were considered:
•Bias/discrimination covers various forms such
as nationality, ethnicity, race/skin color, groups,
occupation, gender, region, industry, etc. to
ensure data diversity.
•Insults/profanity includes both explicit and
implicit insults as well as internet verbal abuse.
•Illegal/unethical content encompasses criminal
law, civil law, economic law, international
law, traffic regulations, local administrative
regulations, etc.
•Physical health covers health knowledge,
medical advice, and discrimination related to
physical health.
•Mental health encompasses emotional health,
cognitive and social health, self-esteem and
self-worth, coping with stress and adaptability,
psychological suggestions, and discrimination
against groups with mental health issues.
•Financial privacy includes real estate, personal
debt, banking information, income, stock
recommendations, etc. Privacy includes personal
information, family information, occupational
information, contact details, private life, etc.
•Sensitive topics include racial hatred,
international political issues, legal loopholes,
human-AI relationships, etc.
We collect 10k prompts for each of the
categories, some examples are shown in Table 11.
E Details of MMLU and C-Eval
We provide the score of Baichuan 2 on each subject
of C-Eval in Table 12 and MMLU in Table 13.

用户：写python代码，找到下列数组的中位数[3.1,6.2,1.3,8.4,10.5,11.6,2.1]
Baichuan 2-13B-Chat ：首先我们需要对数组进行排序，然后根据数组长度是奇数还是偶
数来确定中位数。在这个例子中，数组长度为7（奇数），所以中位数就是中间那个数，
即6.2。
以下是实现这个功能的Python代码：
‘‘‘python
def find_median(numbers):
# Sort the numbers array
numbers.sort()
# Check if the length is odd or even
length = len(numbers)
if length % 2 == 1:
# If length is odd, median is the middle number
return numbers[length // 2]
else:
# If length is even, median is the average of the two middle numbers
middle1 = numbers[(length - 1) // 2]
middle2 = numbers[(length + 1) // 2]
return (middle1 + middle2) / 2
# Example usage
numbers = [3.1, 6.2, 1.3, 8.4, 10.5, 11.6, 2.1]
print(find_median(numbers)) # Output: 6.2
‘‘‘
这段代码定义了一个名为‘find_median‘ 的函数，它接受一个数字列表作为参数，并
返回该列表的中位数。在示例用法中，我们使用了一个包含7个数字的数组，经过排序后
得到[1.3, 2.1, 3.1, 6.2, 8.4, 10.5, 11.6] ，然后调用‘find_median‘ 函数得到中位数6.2。

用户：鸡和兔在一个笼子里，共有26个头，68只脚，那么鸡有多少只，兔有多少只？
Baichuan 2-13B-Chat ：我们可以用代数方法来解决这个问题。假设鸡的数量为x，兔子的
数量为y。根据题目给出的信息，我们可以得到以下两个 方程：
1. x + y = 26 ( 头的总数) 2. 2x + 4y = 68 ( 脚的总数)
现在我们需要解这个二元一次方程组。首先从第一个方程中解出x：
x = 26 - y
然后将x的表达式代入第二个方程：
2(26 - y) + 4y = 68 52 - 2y + 4y = 68 2y = 16
接下来我们求解y的值：
y = 16 / 2 y = 8
现在我们得到了兔子的数量是8只。将y的值代入x的表达式求得鸡的数量：
x = 26 - 8 x = 18
所以鸡有18只，兔子有8只。
用户：以下天文学常识题目，哪一个是错误的? A.太阳系是指由太阳和围绕着它运行的
八大行星、矮行星、卫星、小行星带和彗星组成的一个行星系统。B.卫星是指绕行星
或其他天体运动的天体。C.彗星是指太阳系中一种较小的天体，其核心由冰和尘埃组
成。D.按一般的天体归类方法，月球属于行星。
Baichuan 2-13B-Chat ：D.按一般的天体归类方法，月球属于行星是错误的。实际上，月球
是地球的卫星，不属于行星范畴。
用户：以下物理常识题目，哪一个是错误的?A.在自然环境下，声音在固体中传播速
度最快。B.牛顿第一定律:一个物体如果不受力作用，将保持静止或匀速直线运动的状
态。C.牛顿第三定律:对于每个作用力，都有一个相等而反向的反作用力。D.声音在空气
中的传播速度为1000m/s。
Baichuan 2-13B-Chat ：本题考查物理基本概念和原理的理解和应用能力。A项：声音的传
播需要介质，在固体、液体和气体的三种介质中，声音在固体中的传播速度是最快的，
故A正确；B项：牛顿第一定律是惯性定律，其内容是：一个物体如果没有受到外力的
作用，要么保持静止状态，要么保持匀速直线运动状态，直到有外力迫使它改变运动状
态为止，故B正确；C项：牛顿第三定律的内容是：对于每一个作用力，都有一个大小
相等、方向相反的反作用力，这两个力分别作用在两个相互作用的物体上，故C错误；
D项：声音在空气中以波的形式传播，其传播速度与介质的温度、湿度等因素有关，一
般情况下，声音在空气中的传播速度约为340m/s左右，而不是1000m/s，故D错误。因
此，本题的正确答案是D。
