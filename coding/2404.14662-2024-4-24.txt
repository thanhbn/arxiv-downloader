A fundamental skill among human developers is the ability to understand and reason about program
execution. As an example, a programmer can mentally simulate code execution in natural language to
debug and repair code ( aka. rubber duck debugging). However, large language models (LLMs) of code
are typically trained on the surface textual form of programs, thus may lack a semantic understanding
of how programs execute at run-time. To address this issue, we propose NE xT, a method to teach LLMs
to inspect the execution traces of programs (variable states of executed lines) and reason about their
run-time behavior through chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales. Specifically, NE xT uses self-training to
bootstrap a synthetic training set of execution-aware rationales that lead to correct task solutions ( e.g.,
fixed programs) without laborious manual annotation. Experiments on program repair tasks based on
MbppandHumanEval demonstrate that NE xT improves the fix rate of a PaLM 2 model, by 26.1%
and14.3%absolute, respectively, with significantly improved rationale quality as verified by automated
metrics and human raters. Our model can also generalize to scenarios where program traces are absent
at test-time.
1. Introduction
Recent years have witnessed the burgeoning of large language models (LLMs) trained on code (Anil
et al., 2023; Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021a; Li et al., 2023; Roziere et al., 2023; Touvron et al.,
2023). While those LLMs achieve impressive performance in assisting developers with writing (Chen
et al., 2021a), editing (Fakhoury et al., 2023), explaining (Hu et al., 2018), and reviewing (Li et al.,
2022) code, they still struggle on more complex software engineering tasks that require reasoning
about the runtime execution behavior of programs (Ma et al., 2023). On the other hand, it is not
always sufficient for the model to suggest good code solutions, but it is often necessary to provide
an explanation to developers to document what the change does and why it is needed. These
explanations can help developers better understand the code solutions from models and make more
informative decisions. (Cito et al., 2022; Kang et al., 2023; Ross et al., 2023).
For example, program repair (Chen et al., 2018; Le Goues et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020) is the task
of fixing bugs in a program. Human developers usually learn to debug and fix code by interacting
with code interpreters or debuggers to inspect the variable states of executed lines (Siegmund et al.,
2014). Such practice helps them acquire a mental model of program execution (Heinonen et al.,
2022), so that they could mentally simulate code execution in a more abstract manner using natural
language as in rubber duck debugging (Hunt and Thomas, 1999). Therefore, a program repair model
would be more helpful to developers if the model could carry out similar reasoning about program
execution in order to explain bugs to programmers.
With this inspiration, our goal is to improve the ability of LLMs to reason about program execution
when solving coding tasks. In this paper we propose Naturalized Execution Tuning (NE xT), which
aims to teach LLMs to reason with code execution by inspecting program execution traces and
reasoning about the code’s runtime behavior in natural language (NL). At a general level, for a coding

CoT Rationales…Code Outputdef extract_values(string):str_list = string.replace('"',’’).split(",")return str_listThe problem spec asks to extract values between quotation marks of a string.Now let’s look at the program. The program first uses replace() to remove all quotation marks, and then uses split() to split the string by commas. This seems to work fine for the second and third assertions. But for the first assertion, the return value is ['Python', ' PHP', ' Java'] while the expected output is ['Python', 'PHP', 'Java'].The reason is that the input string has spaces before and after each comma, and split() will split the string by commas and alsokeep the spaces.Here is a fixed version that uses re.findall() to extract the substringsbetween quotation marks:import redef extract_values(string):str_list = re.findall('"(.*?)"', string)return str_listcorrectness filteringtrainingsampling

samples that lead to correct task solutions.
task, the main idea is to train a model to generate intermediate NL rationales, as in chain-of-thought
reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a), but to provide the model with a trace of the execution of the program
in question, so the rationale can be more accurate and grounded on program semantics. Teaching
LLMs to reason about program execution in NL would not only offer better interpretability, it could
also increase the diversity of solutions predicted by the model (Yin et al., 2023).
Fig. 1 illustrates our proposed approach when applied to program repair. Given an NL task
instruction ( 𝑥in Fig. 1) and a buggy program ( ˜𝑦), as well as the execution traces of the program
(𝜖), an LLM solves the task ( e.g.,predict the fixed code ˆ𝑦) using chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to
generate a natural language rationale (ˆ𝑟) leveraging the execution information1. Intuitively, program
traces encode useful debugging information such as line-by-line variable states ( e.g.,the value of
str_list in𝜖, Fig. 1) or any exceptions thrown, which could be useful for LLMs to identify and fix
bugs by reasoning over the expected and the actual execution results ( e.g.,“highlightedtext”inˆ𝑟). To
help LLMs understand execution traces, NE xT represent traces as compact inline code comments
(e.g., # (1) str_list= ...in𝜖, more in §3), without interrupting the original program structure.
While execution traces capture informative runtime behavior, we find it challenging for LLMs
to effectively leverage them out-of-box through CoT prompting (§3). Therefore we opt to finetune
LLMs on high-quality CoT rationales that reason about program execution (§4). NE xT uses weakly-
supervised self-training (Zelikman et al., 2022) to bootstrap a synthetic training set by sampling
rationales that lead to correct task solutions ( e.g.,fixed code ˆ𝑦in Fig. 1) verified by unit tests (Ye et al.,
2022). Using unit tests as weak supervision, NE xT learns to discover task-specific, execution-aware
NL rationales without relying on laborious manual annotation of rationales (Chung et al., 2022;
Lightman et al., 2023; Longpre et al., 2023) or distilling such data from stronger teacher models (Fu
et al., 2023; Gunasekar et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2023; Mukherjee et al., 2023). NE xT executes this
self-training loop for multiple iterations (Anthony et al., 2017; Dasigi et al., 2019), solving more
challenging tasks with improved success rate and rationale quality (§5).
1While there are a variety types of execution information that we may provide to an LLM ( e.g.,variable read/write,
runtime environments), in this work we limit the execution information to program states and variable values from the
execution trace, which is common information that (human) developers also use.

WeevaluateNE xTwiththePaLM2-Lmodel(Aniletal.,2023)ontwoPythonprogramrepairtasks.
Experiments (§5) show that NE xT significantly improves PaLM 2’s ability to reason about program
execution in natural language, improving the program fix rate on Mbpp-R by26.1%andHuman-
EvalFix-Plus by14.3%absolute, respectively. When compared against a strong self-training
program repair approach without predicting NL rationales (Ye et al., 2022), our model achieves
comparable accuracy with significantly improved sample diversity. Interestingly, while our model
learns to reason with pre-existing execution information in input program traces, it also generalizes
to the out-of-distribution scenario where execution traces are not available at test-time. Finally, to
measure the quality of model-generated rationales, we propose a proxy-based evaluation approach,
which approximates rationale quality using the performance of smaller LLMs when prompted to solve
the original task following those rationales from our models. Through both proxy-based evaluation
and human annotation, we demonstrate that NE xT produces helpful NL rationales which explain the
causes of bugs while suggesting potential fixes. The generated rationales are of significantly higher
quality compared to those from the base PaLM 2-L model.
2. Task: Program Repair with Traces
Here we introduce our task of program repair with execution traces using chain-of-thought reasoning.
Program Repair with Execution Traces. As in Fig. 1, given an instruction 𝑥and a buggy code
solution ˜𝑦, automated program repair (Le Goues et al., 2019) aims to generate a fixed program ˆ𝑦
such that ˆ𝑦passes all test cases 𝑡∈𝑇in an executorE,i.e.,E(ˆ𝑦,𝑇)=1whileE(˜𝑦,𝑇)=0. In this paper
we focus on the task of program repair using execution traces (Bouzenia et al., 2023). Specifically, a
program trace 𝜖is a sequence of intermediate variable states after executing each statement in ˜𝑦
against a test case 𝑡. Intuitively, traces record the computation of a program, and can provide useful
debugging information ( e.g.,exceptions) to repair ˜𝑦.
To use LLMs to repair programs with traces, we concatenate the task instruction, the buggy code,
the test cases, and their execution traces as a prompt (Fig. 1). To help LLMs understand program
traces, we design a prompt-friendly trace representation by formatting 𝜖as compact inline code
comments ( i.e.,𝜖in Fig. 1), as discussed later.
CoT Reasoning with Execution. We focus on using chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al.,
2022b) to solve program repair problems by reasoning with execution, where an LLM is prompted
to generate an NL rationale ˆ𝑟together with a fixed program ˆ𝑦as in Fig. 1. Specifically, we consider
rationalesthatcontainreasoningstepstoidentifyandexplainbugsintheoriginalcode( e.g.,thesecond
paragraph in ˆ𝑟, Fig. 1), as well as suggestions to fix the buggy code ( e.g.,“a fixed version that uses
re.findall() ”inˆ𝑟). Since rationales are generated using traces, they often include useful reasoning
about program execution that helps localize the bug, such as identifying a counterfactual between
the expected and the actual variable values of a statement ( e.g.,the“highlightedtext”inˆ𝑟). Such

explanations can be helpful for developers to understand bugs in the original code and the model’s
fixed solutions (Kang et al., 2023). We therefore aim to improve the quality of NL rationales along
with the fix rate by teaching LLMs to reason with execution information.
An LLM-friendly Trace Representation. The raw execution traces collected at runtime contain
complete variable states for each executed statement.2Encoding all such information in prompts is
not feasible given the context limit and computation overhead of LLMs. To address this issue and
make execution information more intelligible to LLMs, we propose an inline trace representation
format, which encodes variable states as inline comments of the traced program. Fig. 2 shows an
example. Specifically, each inline comment only encodes changed variables after executing that
line. Because statements may be invoked multiple times in non-obvious orders ( e.g.,in loops like
lines 4 to 8 in Fig. 2), we index the variable states based on the execution order ( e.g., (3) n=1; and
(4) even_list=[1] ), and one may reconstruct the original execution footprint by following those
variable states in order. We further compress the trace information for loops by omitting the variable
states in intermediate iterations ( e.g.,“...” in lines 4, 6, and 8). Intuitively, by showing states as
pseudo-comments within the original code without interrupting the program structure, our trace
representation is significantly more compact than existing approaches that unroll executed lines of
code and pair them with line-by-line variable states ( c.f., Bouzenia et al., 2023; Nye et al., 2021),3
while allowing an LLM to leverage its learned code representation to understand the additional
execution effect of each statement. Implementation details about handling complex control structures
are discussed in Appendix A.1.
3.PreliminaryStudy: CanLLMsreasonwithprogramtracesinnaturallanguage?
Before introducing NE xT, we first conduct a preliminary study to explore whether LLMs could reason
with execution traces in natural language out-of-box without additional training. Answering this
question will motivate our finetuning approach to improve such reasoning skills. Specifically, we
follow the trace representation in §2 and few-shot prompt an LLM to solve program repair tasks using
CoT reasoning.
Models. Weevaluatethefollowinggeneral-purposemodels: PaLM2(Aniletal.,2023),GPT(Ope-
nAI, 2023)4, and Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024). We also test two code-specific LLMs: StarCoder (Li et al.,
2023) and DeepSeek Coder (Guo et al., 2024). Tab. 1 reports the results on two Python program
repair datasets (see §5 for details).
2We use the sys.settrace() hook in Python.
3As a comparison, 95% examples in our Mbpp-R benchmark can fit into a 2K context window using our inline
representation, while only 60% of them can fit into the same window using the Scratchpad trace format in Nye et al.
(2021). A more detailed comparison is shown in Tab. 7.

LLMs struggle on CoT reasoning with traces. We observed mixed results when comparing
vanilla prompting with traces without CoT ( Vanilla w/ trace in Tab. 1) and CoT prompting with
rationales (+CoT). Surprisingly, CoT prompting is even worse on HumanEvalFix-Plus , with an
averagedropof−7.8%comparedtovanillaprompting, especiallyforcode-specificLLMs( 57.3↦→30.5
for DeepSeek Coder and 29.3↦→16.5for StarCoder). After inspecting sampled rationales predicted
by PaLM 2-L, we observe that the model is subject to strong hallucination issues, such as mentioning
exceptions not reflected in the given traces. Indeed, as we later show in §5.2, the overall correctness
rate of explaining errors in input programs among these sampled rationales from PaLM 2-L is only
around 30%. Moreover, CoT reasoning is even more challenging for those models when we remove
execution traces from the inputs ( +CoT;−trace), resulting in an average performance drop of 4.8%
onMbpp-R and4.3%onHumanEvalFix-Plus . These results suggest that while our trace
representation is useful for LLMs to understand and leverage execution information for program
repair (since “−trace” leads to worse results), they could still fall short on CoT reasoning using natural
language with those program traces. This finding therefore motivates us to improve LLMs in reasoning
with execution through finetuning, which we elaborate in §4.
4. NE xT: Naturalized Execution Tuning
We present NE xT, a self-training method to finetune LLMs to reason with program execution using
synthetic rationales.
Overview of NE xT.Fig. 1 illustrates NE xT, with its algorithm detailed in Algo. 1. NE xT is
based on existing self-trained reasoning approaches (Uesato et al., 2022; Zelikman et al., 2022),
which employ expert iteration to improve a base LLM using synthetic rationales sampled from the
model. Given a training set Dof repair tasks with execution traces, NE xT first samples candidate NL
rationales and fixed code solutions from the LLM. Those candidate solutions are filtered using unit
test execution diagnostics, and those that pass all test cases are then used to update the model via
finetuning. This sample-filter-train loop is performed for multiple iterations, improving the model’s
rationales and repair success rate after each iteration.
Samplingrationalesandcodesolutions. For each iteration 𝑖, we sample rationales ˆ𝑟and fixes ˆ𝑦
in tandem from the current model 𝑃𝜃(𝑖)(Line 5, Algo. 1). We use few-shot prompting (§3) when 𝑖=0
and zero-shot prompting with trained models for later iterations. In contrast to existing self-training
methods that leverage all training problems, NE xT only samples candidate solutions from the subset
of problems inDthat are challenging for the base model 𝑃𝜃(0)to solve (Line 1). Specifically, given a
metricM(·), we only use problems 𝑑∈Dif𝑃𝜃(0)’s metric on 𝑑is below a threshold 𝑚. Refer to §5 for
more details about the M(·)and𝑚of our program repair task. Focusing on sampling solutions from
those hard problems not only significantly reduces sampling cost, it also improves program repair
accuracy, as it helps the model towards learning to solve more challenging problems. See Appendix C
for a more detailed analysis.
Filtering candidate solutions. Given a candidate set of sampled NL rationales and their code
fixes, NE xT uses unit test execution results to identify plausible rationales that lead to correct fixes for
learning (Line 6). Using test execution diagnostics as a binary reward function is natural for program
repair tasks since each repair problem in our dataset comes with unit tests to test the functional
correctness of its proposed fixes (Ye et al., 2022). While we remark that this filtering criteria does not
directly consider rationale quality, we empirically demonstrate in §5 that the quality of rationales
improves as learning continues.5
5The rationale and fix quality may plateau at a different iteration 𝑖.

Discussion. NExTcanbeseenasaninstantiationoftherationalebootstrappingmethodproposed
in Zelikman et al. (2022) (§ 3.1), which synthesizes latent rationales with correct answers for math
and logical reasoning tasks. However, NE xT focuses on program comprehension by reasoning with
execution traces, which is critical for solving challenging coding tasks that require understanding
execution information, such as program repair (§5). Besides, NE xT models both rationales and
programs (code fixes) as latent variables. Using unit test execution results as weak supervision, NE xT
is able to explore possible strategies to reason with execution and discover plausible rationales catered
towards solving the specific downstream task. As we show in Appendix D, rationales generated by
NExT employ a variety of reasoning patterns to locate and explain bugs in our repair dataset. Finally,
while we apply NE xT to program repair, our framework is general and can be extended to other
programming tasks that require reasoning about execution, such as code generation with partial
execution contexts (Yin et al., 2023) or inferring program execution results (Nye et al., 2021), which
we leave as important future work.
5. Experiments
Models. We evaluate NE xT using PaLM 2-L (Unicorn) as the base LLM (Anil et al., 2023). Its
finetuning API is publicly accessible on Google Cloud Vertex AI platform.
Datasets. We use two Python program repair benchmarks, Mbpp-R andHumanEvalFix-
Plus(HeFix+ hereafter). Mbpp-R is a new repair benchmark that we create from Mbpp(Austin
et al., 2021), a popular function-level Python code generation dataset. We create Mbpp-R by
collecting LLM-generated incorrect code solutions to Mbppproblems, with a total of 10,047repair
tasks for training and 1,468tasks (from a disjoint set of Mbppproblems) in the development for
evaluation (Appendix B.1). In addition to Mbpp-R , we also evaluate on HeFix+ .HeFix+ is
derived from HumanEvalFix (Muennighoff et al., 2023) which consists of 164 buggy programs
for problems in the HumanEval dataset (Chen et al., 2021a). We further augment HumanEval-
Fixwith the more rigorous test suites from EvalPlus (Liu et al., 2023) to obtain HeFix+ . While
both original datasets MbppandHumanEval feature function-level algorithmic code generation

problems, problems from the two datasets may still differ in their topics, algorithms or data structures
used. Therefore, we use HeFix+ to measure generalization ability without further finetuning.
Evaluating Code Fixes. We use pass@𝑘(Chen et al., 2021a; Kulal et al., 2019), defined as
the fraction of solved repair tasks using 𝑘samples (𝑘≤25), to measure the end-to-end functional
correctness of fixed programs with tests.
Evaluating Rationale Quality. Decoupling the quality of intermediate CoT rationales and
downstream task performance (program repair pass@𝑘) is a non-trivial research question in LLM
reasoning(Prasadetal.,2023),withmostworksonimprovingCoTreasoningstillhill-climbingtowards
downstream task performance without evaluating intermediate rational quality ( e.g.,Lightman et al.
(2023)). To disentangle the evaluation of rationale quality from end-to-end repair accuracy, we
propose an extrinsic proxy-based evaluation metric for rationales. Specifically, given a rationale 𝑟,
we prompt a smaller LLM to solve the original repair task conditioning on 𝑟, and use the correctness
of the predicted code fix (using greedy decoding) to approximate the quality of 𝑟. Intuitively, smaller
LLMs would rely more on information from the rationale and could be more sensitive to its errors.
Therefore, their performance could be a better indicator of rationale quality. We report averaged
scores on two PaLM 2 variants for proxy-based evaluation: 1) a smaller general-purpose language
model PaLM 2-S; and 2) PaLM 2-S∗which is specialized in coding (Anil et al., 2023). Note that
while we primarily use proxy-based metrics to evaluate rationales, we also perform human ratings of
rationale quality (§5.2), with results in line with our proxy-based evaluation.
Hyperparameters. We perform temperature sampling ( 𝑇=0.8) with a sample size of 32 for
training (|𝑆𝑗|=32in Algo. 1) and pass@𝑘evaluation. In the first iteration in Algo. 1, we use pass@1
estimated with these 32 samples as the filtering metric M(·)to find challenging problems whose
M(·)≤ 10%for training. We perform 10iterations of NE xT training and pick the best model using
pass@1on the development set.

5.1. Main Results
In our experiments, we compare our model with strong LLMs (used in §3), analyze the impact of
rationales and program traces, and perform generalization experiments on HeFix+ and human
evaluation of rationale quality.
NExTimprovesprogramfixrate. We first compare the end-to-end program repair performance
of PaLM 2-L before and after NE xT training ( PaLM 2-L+NExT) in Tab. 2 ( Left). NE xT leads to signifi-
cant improvements on the end-to-end fix rates across the board, with a 26.1%absolute improvement
onpass@1. Interestingly, the gain on pass@𝑘is generally higher for smaller 𝑘. This might suggest
that the model becomes more confident about program fixes after NE xT training, while the sample
diversity also improves, as indicated by improved pass@25. For reference, we also include results
from GPT models. Notably, PaLM 2-L +NExToutperforms GPT-3.5 on all pass@𝑘metrics.
NExT improves rationale quality. Table 2 ( Right) shows the improvements of PaLM 2-L +NExT
on our proxy-based evaluation, where we approximate rationale quality using the performance of
smaller LMs when conditioned on those rationales. Again, NE xT yields consistent improvements
across all pass@𝑘metrics. This suggests that NE xT improves PaLM 2-L’s skill in reasoning with
execution to solve Mbpp-R problems, leading to rationales that are more helpful for smaller LMs. In
Appendix D, we present a case study to demonstrate different reasoning strategies PaLM 2-L +NExT
adopts to repair programs using execution information. As we later show in §5.2, our proxy-based
metrics are also consistent with human ratings, and rationales from PaLM 2-L +NExTare strongly
preferred by annotators compared to those from PaLM 2-L.
PaLM 2-L+NExToutperforms strong LLMs. We compare PaLM 2-L +NExTwith a series of
strong LLMs from the preliminary study (§3) in Figure 3. PaLM 2-L +NExToutperforms strong open-
source LLMs by a minimum of 29.4% and 11.1% on end-to-end and proxy-based pass@1results,
respectively, while on par with GPT-3.5. These results show that PaLM 2-L +NExTis a competitive
model on program repair by reasoning with execution.
Learning to reason in natural language improves generalization and sample diversity. To
further demonstrate the importance of using CoT reasoning in NE xT self-training, we compare
PaLM 2-L+NExTwith a strong self-training-based program repair model implemented in NE xT,
which directly generates code fixes using runtime execution information without CoT reasoning. This
ablation resembles SelfAPR (Ye et al., 2022), which also adopts self-training to iteratively synthesize
datausingunittestdiagnostics, whileourablationusestraceswithricherexecutioninformation. Fig.4
shows model performance w.r.t. NE xT training iterations. When trained without CoT reasoning ( NExT

w/o rationale ), PaLM 2-L converges much faster on the training set, which is not surprising since the
model only learns to generate code fixes without additional reasoning tasks such as explaining bugs
in NL. However, on the Devset, PaLM 2-L+NExTstill outperforms this baseline in pass@10with
comparable pass@1accuracy, and the gap on pass@10becomes larger with more iterations. This
shows that by reasoning in natural language, PaLM 2-L +NExTgeneralizes much better to unseen
Mbpp-R problems with greater sample diversity. In Fig. 6 of Appendix C, we also show that the gain
from PaLM 2-L+NExTagainst this ablation on pass@𝑘is even more pronounced for larger 𝑘 >10,
which suggests that learning to reason in CoT rationales improves sample diversity on program repair,
similar to the findings on other code generation tasks (Yin et al., 2023).
Reasoning with execution traces is critical. To understand the importance of leveraging
program traces to reason with execution, we compare with an ablation of NE xTwithout using
program traces, which follows the same procedure in Algo. 1 except that traces 𝜖are not used to
generate rationales in Line 5 ( NExT w/o traces , Fig. 4). This variant can also be seen as a direct
application of the rationale generation bootstrapping method in Zelikman et al. (2022), which trains a
modelonsampledrationalesthatleadtocorrecttasksolutionswithoutrelyingonadditionalexecution
information. Without traces, PaLM 2-L is consistently worse than PaLM 2-L +NExTon the Devset
across iterations, both in terms of end-to-end fix rate and proxy-based metrics. This suggests that
reasoning with execution information is critical for PaLM 2-L on program repair tasks. Interestingly,
while the gap on the development set is significant, the two models achieve similar scores on the
training set, which suggests that reasoning with pre-existing execution traces also help the model
generalize better to unseen tasks at test-time.
Our model works without traces at test-time. While program traces are crucial for reasoning
with execution, such execution information may not always be available at test time ( e.g.,when
execution is prohibitively expensive). To stress-test PaLM 2-L +NExTin scenarios where execution
information is absent, we remove execution traces from its input at test time in Table 3. PaLM 2-
L+NExTstill yields an end-to-end fix rate of 40.8%, which is an 21.8%improvement over the 3-shot
PaLM 2-L baseline and is only 3.3%lower than NE xT trained without traces, for which is tested
in-distribution. The results from the proxy-based evaluation of rationales are also consistent with the
fix rate.
Our model generalizes to HeFix+ at test-time. To further evaluate the generalization
ability of PaLM 2-L +NExT, we test our model (trained on Mbpp-R ) onHeFix+ . Tab. 4 summarizes
the results. NE xT achieves reasonable generalization on HeFix+ , outperforming the base PaLM 2-L
model by a large margin ( i.e.,14.3%on end-to-end fix rate and 6.0%on proxy evaluation). Aligned
with our previous findings on Mbpp-R in Fig. 4, reasoning with execution traces ( c.f.w/o traces)
improves fix rate and rationale quality. Moreover, we remark that with iterative learning, PaLM 2-
L+NExTis on par with the strong program repair method without CoT reasoning (w/o rationale),
similartotheresultson Mbpp-R .Thisisincontrastwithourpreliminarystudyin§3, wherePaLM2-L
with CoT prompting is much worse than vanilla prompting without using rationales. Overall, these
results indicate that PaLM 2-L +NExTcould robustly generalize to out-of-distribution repair tasks

5.2. Human Evaluation of Rationale Quality
Our proxy-based evaluation suggests the extrinsic value of the CoT rationales from PaLM 2-L +NExT.
Wefurtherconductanintrinsicevaluationbymanuallyratingthequalityofmodel-predictedrationales
on104sampled Mbpp-R repairtasksfromthe Devset. Specifically, weaskraterstojudgethequality
of rationales generated by three models (PaLM 2-L +NExT, PaLM 2-L and GPT-3.5) in a three-way
side-by-side setting. Each rationale is rated in two aspects: (1) its helpfulness in explaining bugs
(𝑄1,e.g.,first two paragraphs in ˆ𝑟, Fig. 1), and (2) its helpfulness in suggesting code fixes ( 𝑄2,e.g.,
“a fixed version that uses ...”inˆ𝑟). Each question has a three-scale answer (
 Completely correct
and very helpful;
 Partially correct with minor errors but still helpful;
 Incorrect and not helpful).
We also compute an overall score of rationale quality using numeric values of {+1,0.5,0}for the
three scales and averaged over 𝑄1and𝑄2. Finally, we ask raters to pick a single best choice if there
is not a clear tie. More details about our human evaluation pipeline is described in Appendix B.3.
Tab. 5 summarizes the result. Compared to the base PaLM 2 model, PaLM 2-L +NExTgener-
ates significantly more high-quality rationales with correct explanations of bugs and fix suggestions.
Additionally, compared to GPT-3.5, PaLM 2-L +NExTalso has more rationales with correct bug expla-
nations, while interestingly, GPT-3.5 generates more rationales with partially correct fix suggestions.
We hypothesize that including more exemplars with detailed fix suggestions to our few-shot prompts
duringNE xTtraining(AppendixE)wouldhelpmitigatethisissue. Nevertheless, theoverallscoresand

rater-assigned best choice suggest that the rationales predicted by PaLM 2-L +NExTare of significantly
higher quality compared to those from PaLM 2-L, and are on par with the predictions from GPT-3.5.
Overall, this finding is in line with the proxy evaluation results in Fig. 3 (GPT 3.5 ≈PaLM 2-L+NExT
≫PaLM 2-L), suggesting that the latter is a reasonable surrogate metric for rationale quality. In
Appendix D, we present example generated rationales that show a variety of reasoning patterns.
6. Related Work
Reasoning about Program Execution Several lines of research has explored learning methods to
reason about program execution. Program synthesis systems often leverage the execution states of
partially generated programs (Chen et al., 2021b; Shi et al., 2022; Shin et al., 2018; Wang et al.,
2018) or the next execution subgoals (Shi et al., 2024) to guide search in sequence-to-sequence
models. There has also been work on training neural networks to mimic program execution, like
a learned interpreter (Bieber et al., 2020; Nye et al., 2021; Zaremba and Sutskever, 2014), often
with specialized neural architectures to model the data flow of program execution (Bieber et al.,
2022; Bosnjak et al., 2016; Gaunt et al., 2016; Graves et al., 2014). Instead of using domain-specific
architectures to encode and reason about program execution, our work focuses on teaching LLMs
to reason with execution in natural language. In particular, Scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021) and Self-
Debugging (Chen et al., 2023) are two notable works that also models execution traces using LLMs.
The core difference is that these methods focus on predicting reasoning chains that contain trace
information, such as executed lines with variable states (Nye et al., 2021) or their natural language
summaries (Chen et al., 2023). On the other hand, NE xT aims to leverage existing execution traces
from a runtime to aid the reasoning process, which often leads to more compact rationales tailored
for downstream tasks. We present a more detailed comparison and discussion on NE xT and these
related works in Appendix A.3.
Program Repair Several works in program repair have leveraged execution information such as
traces (Bouzenia et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2020) or test diagnostics (Xia and Zhang, 2023; Ye et al.,
2022). Different from Bouzenia et al. (2023) which represents traces by directly pairing unrolled
executed lines with their variable states, NE xT inlines indexed variable states as code comments,
which is more token efficient while preserving the original code structure. Similar to NE xT, Ye et al.
(2022)constructsyntheticself-trainingdatausingtestexecutionresults, whileourapproachgenerates
both NL rationales and fixed programs with better interpretability. Recently, LLMs have been applied
to program repair (Fan et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023; Paul et al., 2023; Sobania et al., 2023; Xia and
Zhang, 2022; Xia et al., 2023). Among them, Kang et al. (2023) uses a ReAct-style CoT reasoning
loop (Yao et al., 2022) to predict repair actions based on interactive feedback from debuggers, while
NExT focuses on tuning LLMs to reason with pre-existing execution information without intermediate
feedback. Finally, as a related stream of research, self-improvement methods iteratively refine a
model’s code solutions using CoT reasoning over self-provided (Madaan et al., 2023) or test-driven
feedback (Chen et al., 2023; Olausson et al., 2023). Instead of relying on high-level execution signals
like error messages, NE xT trains LLMs to reason with step-wise program traces. Our learnable
rationales are also more flexible without following a predefined reasoning template. Besides, since
traces already capture rich execution semantics, the resulting rationales could be more succinct and
targeted to the downstream task ( e.g.,explain bugs), without redundant reasoning steps to trace the
program by the model itself to recover useful execution information.
Supervised CoT Reasoning LLMs can solve problems more accurately when instructed to work
out the answer step by step in a chain of thought or ascratchpad (Nye et al., 2021; Rajani et al.,
2019; Shwartz et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022a). Improvements on this approach involve finetuning
LLMs on chain-of-thought reasoning data. Such CoT data is either manually curated (Chung et al.,
11

--- PAGE 12 ---
NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution
2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Longpre et al., 2023), or distilled from more capable teacher models (Fu
et al., 2023; Gunasekar et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2023; Mukherjee et al., 2023). Instead of relying
on labeled or distilled data, NE xT uses self-training to iteratively bootstrap a synthetic dataset of
high-quality rationales with minimal manual annotation. Our work differs from previous work using
bootstrapping (Hoffman et al., 2023; Zelikman et al., 2022) in the type of rationales and the use of
execution information; see §4 for more discussion. While we use the correctness of the program fix for
filtering the rationales, which is reminiscent of outcome supervision; it is also possible to use process
supervision with human annotations (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), or obtain such
supervision automatically by estimating the quality of each step using Monte Carlo Tree Search (Wang
et al., 2024) and by identifying partially-correct program prefixes (Ni et al., 2022). Finally, existing
research has investigated finetuning of LLMs to predict the execution information directly, such as
predicting line-by-line execution traces (Nye et al., 2021), abstract runtime properties (Pei et al.,
2023), or final output (Bieber et al., 2020; Zaremba and Sutskever, 2014). NE xT addresses a different
problem; instead of predicting the execution information, NE xT takes it as given, and instead learns
to discover flexible task-specific NL rationales that aid a downstream programming task.
7. Conclusion
In this paper we present NE xT, a self-training method to finetune LLMs to reason with program
execution given traces. We demonstrate that PaLM 2-L trained using NE xT yields high-quality natural
language rationales and achieves stronger success rates on two program repair tasks. As future work,
we plan to apply NE xT to a broader range of program understanding tasks while expanding the trace
representation to support more programming languages.

NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution
A. Additional Details of NE xT
A.1. Details for Inline Trace Representation
Definitions. A program 𝑦∈Yconsists of a sequence of statements {𝑢1,...,𝑢𝑚}. And a program state
ℎis a mapping between identifiers ( i.e.,variable names) to values, i.e.,ℎ∈{𝑘↦→𝑣|𝑘∈K,𝑣∈V}.
Given an input to the program, an execution trace is defined as a sequence of program states, i.e.,
𝜖={ℎ1,...,ℎ𝑡}, which are the results after executing the statements with the order of execution ,i.e.,
{𝑢𝑒1,𝑢𝑒2,...,𝑢𝑒𝑡}. In this way, the relation between program statements and execution states can be
seen as a function that maps from states to statements, i.e.,ℎ𝑖↦→𝑢𝑒𝑖, because each statement could
be executed multiple times due to loops or recursion.
Program state representation. For typical programs, most of the variable values will stay the same
between two adjacent states ℎ𝑖−1andℎ𝑖. Thus to save tokens, we represent a state ℎ𝑖only by the
variables that have changed the value compared with the previous state ℎ𝑖−1. And we use a reified
variable state representation, i.e.,using the grammar for an init function in Python ( e.g., lst=[1, 2,
3]). Note that it is possible for a statement to have no effect on any traceable variables ( e.g.,“pass”, or
“print”, or “ lst[i]=lst[i] ”). To distinguish this case with unreached statements ( e.g.,“else” branch
that next got executed), we append a string “ NO_CHANGE ” instead. In addition to the variable state, we
number all the states by the order of execution and prepend the ordinal number to the beginning of
the state, e.g.,“(1) odd_list=[] ” in Fig. 2.
Inline trace representation. To obtain the inline trace representation, we first group the program
states in a trace 𝜖by the corresponding program statements to collect a sequence of states for the
same statement 𝑢𝑖as𝐻𝑖={ℎ𝑗|𝑢𝑒𝑗=𝑢𝑖}, and we order the states in 𝐻𝑖by the execution order. For
statements inside a loop body, or a function that is called recursively, the number of corresponding
states can be very large. In order to further save tokens, if |𝐻𝑖|>3, we will only incorporate
the first two states and the last state, and skip the ones in the middle. After that, we simply
concatenate all the state representations with the semicolon “ ;” as the delimiter, and append it
after the statement itself 𝑢𝑖following a hash “ #” to note it as an inline comment. An example of
the resulting representation is “ even_list.append(n) # (4) even_list=[1]; (8) even_list=[1, 3];
...; (20) even_list=[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]; ”, as shown in Fig. 2.
Limitations. First of all, our tracing framework currently do not extend beyond native Python
programs, thus it can not trace code that is not written in Python ( e.g.,C code in numpy). One other
limitation of our tracing representation is that for “ if” conditions, though it would be better to leave
traces of “ (1) True; (2) True; (3); False; ”, currently our tracing framework that based on the
“sys.settrace() ” hook of Python does not capture this. However, since we labeled all the states
by the execution order, the LLMs can infer the conditions by the fact that certain branch is taken.
Another limitation is the representation of Collections. Currently we still present all the elements in
a collection, and empirically it works well with benchmarks as Mbpp-R andHeFix+ . However,
certain heuristics may be needed to skip certain elements ( e.g.,like the one we use to skip certain
states in a loop) to be more token efficient. For more complex objects ( e.g.,Tensors, DataFrames),
while we can define heuristics to represent key properties of those objects in traces ( e.g.,“a float
tensor of shape 128 x 64”,“a Dataframe with columns Name, Math, ...”), perhaps a more interesting
idea would be to let the models decide which properties they would inspect and generate relevant
code (e.g.,“tensor.shape ” or “ df.head(3) ”) to inspect them in a debugger or interpreter ( e.g.,pdb).
The same idea can be applied to longer programs, as the model can selectively decide which lines

of code to inspect and create traces for, similar to how human developers debug programs. We will
leave these as exciting future directions.
A.2. Details for Iterative Self-Training
Bootstrapping rationales and fixes via temperature sampling. To avoid potential “cold start”
problem (Liang et al., 2018; Ni et al., 2020), for the first iteration, we use few-shot prompting with
three exemplars (shown in Appendix E) and set the sample size to 96. For all later iterations, we use
zero-shot prompting as the model is already adapted to the style of the rationales and fixes after the
first round of finetuning, and we set the sample size to 32. We set the sampling temperature 𝑇=0.8
for all iterations.
Filtering rationales and fixes. Given the inputs in the prompt, we sample the rationale and fixes in
tandem. To separate the natural language rationale and the program fix, we use an regular expression
in Python to extract the content between two sets of three backticks ( ```), which is commonly used
to note code blocks in markdown.6After we filter out the rationales and fixes that are incorrect using
the test cases, we create the training set by sub-sampling correct “(rationale, fix)” pairs to allow a
maximum of 3 correct fixes with their rationales for each problem in Mbpp-R . This is to balance the
number of rationales and fixes for each problem and avoid examples from certain examples (typically
easier ones) being overly represented in the training set.
A.3. Discussion with Previous Work
Here we discuss NE xT in the context of two important previous work in the domain of reasoning
about program execution, namely Scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021) and Self-Debugging Chen et al. (2023).
Such comparison is also characterized by Tab. 6.
Scratchpad and NE xT.Similarly to NE xT, Nye et al. (2021) also proposed to use execution traces
to help the LLMs to reason about program execution. However, Nye et al. (2021) aimed to generate
these traces as intermediate reasoning steps at inference time, either via few-shot prompting or model
6For the strong LLMs that we used in this work, we did not observe any issue for following this style, which is specified in
the few-shot prompt. The only exceptions are with GPT models, where they typically append the language ( i.e.,“python”)
after the first set of backticks ( e.g., ```python), which we also handled with regex.
19

NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution
fine-tuning. Yet in NE xT, we use execution traces as part of the input to the LLMs, so they can directly
use the execution states to ground the generated natural language rationales. Moreover, we choose
to use natural language as the primary format for reasoning, which is more flexible and easier to be
understood by the human programmers. We also perform a length comparison of our proposed inline
trace representation with the scratchpad representation proposed in Tab. 7, and results show that our
proposed inline trace representation is much more compact than scratchpad.
Self-Debugging and NE xT.Self-Debugging (Chen et al., 2023) is a seminal approach that also
performs CoT reasoning over program execution to identify errors in code solutions. Different from
NExT, Self-Debugging can optionally leverages high-level execution error messages to bootstrap CoT
reasoning, while our method trains LLMs to reason with concrete step-wise execution traces. In
addition, Self-Debugging also introduced a particular form of CoT rationales that resemble step-by-
step traces in natural language. Notably, such rationales are generated by LLMs to aid the model
in locating bugs by simulating execution in a step-by-step fashion. They are not the ground-truth
execution traces generated by actually running the program. As we discussed in §6, in contrast,
our model relies on existing traces from program execution. Since those traces already capture rich
execution information, intuitively, the resulting CoT rationales in NE xT could be more succinct and
“to the point” without redundant reasoning steps to “trace” the program step-by-step by the model
itself in order to recover useful execution information.
Finally, we remark that our “Test w/o Trace” setting in §5.1 shares similar spirits with the setup
in Self-Debugging, as both methods perform CoT reasoning about execution without gold execution
traces. From the results in Tab. 3, NE xT also greatly improves the model’s ability to repair programs
even without using gold execution traces at test time. This may suggest that NE xT can potentially
improve the self-debugging skills of LLMs through iterative training, for which we leave as exciting
future work to explore.
B. Experiment Setup Details
B.1. Creating Mbpp-R
The original Mbppdataset Austin et al. (2021) consists of three splits, i.e.,train/dev/test sets of
374/90/500 Python programming problems. To increase the number of training example, we first
perform a re-split of the original Mbppdataset, by moving half of the test data into the training
split, resulting in 624/90/250 problems in the re-split dataset. Then for each Mbppproblem in
the re-split train and dev set, we collect a set of failed solutions from the released model outputs
in Ni et al. (2023). More specifically, we take the 100samples for each problems, filter out those
correct solutions, and keep the ones that do not pass all the tests. As different problems have various
number of buggy solutions, we balance this out by keeping at most 20buggy solutions for each Mbpp
problem.7This yields the Mbpp-R dataset, with 10,047repair tasks in the training set and 1,468
examples in the dev set.
B.2. Use of test cases.
For each program repair task, there is typically a set of open test cases that are used for debugging
purposes, as well as a set of hidden test cases that are only used for evaluation of correctness. When
7This actually biased the dataset towards harder problems as easier problems may not have more than 20 buggy solutions
from 100 samples, thus it might be one of the reasons for repairing solutions in Mbpp-R to be more challenging than
generating code for the original Mbppdataset.
20

--- PAGE 21 ---
NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution
we generate traces using test cases, we use only the open test cases and only feed the open test cases
to the model as part of the prompt. Then when we evaluate the generated fix, we resort to all test
cases (i.e.,open + hidden tests) and only regard a fix as correct when it passes all test cases. While
theHumanEval dataset makes this distinction between open and test cases, the Mbppdataset
does not make such distinction. Thus for Mbpp-R , we use all test cases both as the inputs and during
evaluation. While this may lead to false positives when the fixes are overfit to the test cases, and we
did find such case during human annotations.

rationales.
21

--- PAGE 22 ---
NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution
B.3. Details of Human Annotation of Rationale Quality
We annotated model predictions on 104 sampled Mbpp-R repair tasks from the Devset. Those fix
tasks are randomly sampled while ensuring that they cover all the 90 dev Mbppproblems. All the
tasks are pre-screened to be valid program repair problems. Annotation is performed in a three-way
side-by-side setting. Models are anonymized and their order is randomized. Raters are asked to
judge the quality of rationales from three models (PaLM 2-L +NExT, PaLM 2-L and GPT-3.5) on the
same Mbpp-R problem. Each rationale is rated from two aspects: (1) its helpfulness in explaining
bugs (𝑄1:Does the rationale correctly explain bugs in the original code? e.g., first two paragraphs in ˆ𝑟,
Fig. 1), and (2) its helpfulness in suggesting code fixes ( 𝑄2:Does the rationale suggest a correct and
helpful fix? e.g., “a fixed version that uses ...”inˆ𝑟, Fig. 1).8Each question has a three-scale answer
(
Completely correct and very helpful ;
 Partially correct with minor errors but still helpful;
Incorrect and not helpful). In a pilot study, we find that fix suggestions could often be redundant if
the rationale already contains detailed explanation of bugs such that a developer could easily correct
the code without an explicit fix suggestion ( e.g.,Example 2, Appendix D). Therefore, for 𝑄2, we also
consider such cases as correct (
 ) if a model didn’t suggest a fix in its rationale but the fix is obvious
after bug explanations. We list our annotation guideline in Fig. 5. Note that for 𝑄2, both answers (1)
and(3)are counted as correct (
 ) answers.
C. Additional Experiment Results
Here we show the learning curve of NE xT and all its ablations in Fig. 6. We also show the full results
forMbpp-R andHeFix+ in Tab. 8 and Tab. 9, respectively.
Learning CoT rationales further improves pass@25.From §5.1, we mention that learning to
reason in natural language improves sample diversity, registering higher pass@10than the baseline
of finetuning for generating fixes only ( NExT w/o Rationale) . From Tab. 8 and Tab. 9, we can
observe that such performance advantage is even larger with pass@25, with 7.6% improvements on
Mbpp-R and 6.8% improvements on HeFix+ .
Trainingonhard-onlyexamples. Onepartofourdatafilteringpipelineistoonlyperformsampling
and train on the samples from hard problems (§4). Here we discuss more about the benefits and
potential issues of doing so, by presenting results on a “ w/o hard-only ” ablation, where the model
learns from rationales and fixes from both hard and easy examples. Efficiency-wise, by only sampling
on the hard example, which is around half of the problems, we greatly can accelerate the sampling
process. And from results in Fig. 6, only training with hard example also comes with performance
benefits under the iterative self-training framework. More specifically, we notice a non-trivial gap
between the training curve of this “w/o hard-only” baseline and the rest of the ablations, especially
forpass@10andpass@25performance on the training set. This means that the model trained on
both easy and hard examples leads to more problems in the training set unsolved ( i.e.,none of the
samples are correct), and no learning signal can come from such problems. This also reflects on the
dev set performance. While it is worth noticing that the end-to-end pass@1performance for “w/o
hard-only” is slightly better than NE xT trained only trained on hard examples, it performs worse in
all other evaluations, with the trend of larger gaps with higher 𝑘values for pass@𝑘, especially for
the proxy-based evaluation. This suggests that training on hard examples not only improves sample
efficiency, but also improves the general fix rate as well as the quality of the generated rationales.
8We only rate the quality of rationales (not the fixed code), while we still show the predicted fixed code to raters for
reference.

Proxy-based evaluation results are consistent with different proxy models. In the previous
proxy-based evaluation §5.1, we report the proxy-based fix rates by averaging over the performance
using PaLM 2-S and PaLM 2-S∗as the proxy models. In Tab. 8 and Tab. 9, we show the separated
results for different proxy models. From these results, we can observe that the relative rationale
quality evaluated by different proxy models are largely consistent, with the stronger proxy model
(PaLM 2-S∗) having better proxy-based fix rates. In addition to the consistency we show with human
annotations, this shows the robustness of our proposed proxy-based evaluation method for measuring
CoT rationale quality.
D. Case Study
In this section we present a set of examples to showcase how PaLM 2-L +NExTreasons with pro-
gram execution to solve Mbpp-R problems. We discover several reasoning patterns the model
exhibits that leverage trace information to identify and explain bugs in programs. First, as shown
inExample 1 , the model could refer to exceptions or error messages in the trace (eg in Trace 2 ) to
explain bugs in the code . Next,Example 2 shows that the model could also leverage variable states
in the trace ( e.g.,inTrace 2 ) and compare them with the expected values to locate the cause of bugs .
Besides, the NO_CHANGE annotations for variables whose values are preserved after execution of a
step could also help the model explain the execution process in the rationale ( e.g., (3)NO_CHANGE↦→
“the first sublist is already sorted” ). Perhaps a more interesting scenario is when the model reasons
over multiple steps of computation to track down the cause of a bug. In Example 3 , the model
attempts to trace the computation of steps 2 - 4 inTrace 1 to explain why the sum is a float instead
of an integer. Another example is Example 4 , where the model summarizes the loop iterations in

steps 2 - 9 ofTrace 1 to explain the cause of the missing last element in the result list. Interestingly,
while the model is able to reason over multiple steps of execution in its rationales, as the reasoning
chain becomes longer, it is more likely to contain minor logical errors, as highlighted in the rationales
of Examples 3 and 4.
Besides minor logical errors in CoT reasoning, we also identify several more pronounced error
modes. First, even if the NL rationale looks valid, the actual code fix might be incorrect ( Example 4 ).
Second,forcaseswheretherearemultiplebugsintheprogram,themodelmightonlyfocusonthemore
obvious bugs during reasoning ( e.g.,explaining the reason of IndexError inTrace 2 ofExample
5), while ignoring the other more nuanced bugs that are buried in the trace ( e.g.,Incorrect outputs
inTrace 1 andTrace 3 caused by zero-initialized freq_arr ). This could be especially problematic
when there are hidden bugs notcaptured by the trace, which could happen when a buggy program
crashes in the middle of execution and the rest the of the code is not covered in the trace. Since the
model could be more reliant on trace information after fine-tuning, it might be more likely to miss
such implicit bugs. As an example, in Example 6 the model only noticed the TypeError in the trace ,
without spotting that the code that computes the end index in the output tuple is off by one.

Rationale and Code Solution: (code fix is correct
 )
The problem spec asks to write a function to remove leading zeroes from an IP address.
Now let 's look at the program. The program first splits the IP address into a list of strings, and then
iterates through the list to convert each string to an integer, and then back to a string. This will remove
leading zeroes. However, the problem is that it iterates through the list for 4 times, but the length of the
list might not be 4. For example, when ‘ip="12.01.024"‘, the length of the list is only 3. Thus when ‘i=3‘,
it will throw an ‘IndexError‘ .
Here is a simple fix:
def removezero_ip(ip):
ip_list = ip.split(".")
for i in range(len(ip_list)):
ip_list[i] = str(int(ip_list[i])).lstrip( '0')
return ".".join(ip_list)

Rationale and Code Solution: (code fix is correct

The problem spec asks to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Now let 's look at the program. The program first sorts the list of lists by the length of each sublist, and
then sorts each sublist. The first assertion passes as the first sublist is already sorted, and the second
sublist is also sorted, and the third sublist is sorted in the for loop.
The second assertion fails as the list of lists is sorted by the length of each sublist, and thus the
return value is not the same as the input. The third assertion passes as the first and the last sublists are
already sorted, and the second and the third sublists are sorted in the for loop.
The problem is that the program sorts the list of lists by the length of each sublist, which is not required
by the problem spec. Thus we can simply remove the first line of the function.
Here is the corrected code:
def sort_sublists(words):
for w in words:
w.sort()
return words

Rationale and Code Solution: (code fix is correct
 )
The problem spec asks to write a function to get the sum of all digits in a non −negative integer.
Now let 's look at the program. The program seems to be correct at the first glance. It first initializes the
sum to 0, and then it uses a while loop to get each digit in the number and add it to the sum. However, if we
look at the output of the program, we will find that the sum is not an integer.
This is because the program does not convert the number to an integer before it gets the digits. For example,
for the first assertion, when ‘number=345‘, the first digit ‘5‘ is added to the sum and ‘sum=5‘. Then ‘number‘
is updated to ‘34.5‘, and the second digit ‘4‘ is added to the sum and ‘sum=9.5‘. And so on .
Here is a fixed version:
def sum_digits(number):
number = int(number)
sum = 0
while(number):
sum += number %
number = number // 10
return sum

Rationale and Code Solution: (code fix is wrong
 )
The problem spec asks to convert a tuple to a list and add a given string after every element.
Now let 's look at the program. The program first converts the tuple to a list, which is good. Then it iterates
from 1 to the length of the list, and inserts the given string at index `i∗2−1`. This seems correct at the
first glance, but the problem is that it will not add the string after the last element. For example, when
‘test_tuple=(5, 6, 7, 4, 9)‘, the length of the list is 5, and the for loop will iterate from 1 to 4. Thus the
string will be inserted at index 1, 3, 5, and 7, which corresponds to after the second, fourth, and sixth
element. The string will not be inserted after the last element (i.e., the ninth element).
Here is a simple fix:

NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution
The problem spec asks to find the difference between the highest and the least frequencies in a given array.
Now let 's look at the program. The program first creates a frequency array of length `n`, and then iterates
through the input array to count the frequency of each number. It then returns the difference between the
maximum and the minimum frequencies in the frequency array.
The program looks good at the first glance.
However, the problem is that the length of the frequency array is ‘n‘, which is the length of the input array.
However, the numbers in the input array can be larger than ‘n‘, and thus the frequency array will not be able
to accommodate all the numbers in the input array. For example, in the second assertion, the input array is
`[1, 7, 9, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3] `, and the length of the frequency array is also `9`. When `nums[i]=9 `, it will try
to access `freq_arr[9] `, which is out of bound, and thus an `IndexError `is thrown.
Here is a simple fix:
def find_Diff(nums, n):
freq_arr = {}
for i in range(len(nums)):
if nums[i] in freq_arr:
freq_arr[nums[i]] += 1
else:
freq_arr[nums[i]] = 1
max_freq = 0
min_freq = 0
for num, freq in freq_arr.items():
if freq > max_freq:
max_freq = freq
if freq < min_freq or min_freq == 0:
min_freq = freq
return max_freq −min_freq

Rationale and Code Solution: (code fix is wrong
 )
Now let 's look at the program. The program looks good at the first glance as `text.find(pattern) `is the
correct way to find the location of a literal string in a given string. But the problem is that it does not use
the `tuple() `function correctly. The `tuple() `function takes a single iterable as input, and returns a tuple
with the elements from the iterable. But in the program, it takes two arguments, which will throw a
‘TypeError‘ of ‘tuple expected at most 1 argument, got 2‘.
Here is a simple fix:
def search_literal(pattern, text):
match = tuple(text.find(pattern),)
match = match + (text.find(pattern) + len(pattern) −1,)
return match

51 The problem spec asks to find the similar elements in the two tuples, from the assertion we can
see that it essentially wants the common elements from the two tuples. It also seems that
the common elements should be returned in a tuple with ascending order.↩→
↩→
52
53 Now let 's look at the program. While it is correct and efficient to use `intersection() `to find
the common elements between two sets, it will also return a set. Take the first assertion as
an example, `s1`will first be converted to a set like `{3, 4, 5, 6} `and similarly for
`s2`, then the return value will be `{4, 5} `. Though the elements are right, the expected
return value is a tuple and not a set. Thus we only need to further convert the sets to
tuples using `tuple() `.↩→

130 The problem spec asks to write a Python function that identifies non-prime numbers. Non-prime
numbers are numbers that are divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself. Note that 0 and 1
are also non-prime numbers.↩→
↩→
131
132 Now let 's check the program. Let 's run the program through some examples. For the first
assertion, when `n=2`, it will enter the `else `branch, and then in the for loop, since the
condition is `i in range(2, n//2+1) `, which is `range(2, 2) `, it will actually not enter the
loop since the condition is not met in the first place. And then it will reach the end of
the function, and the return value will be `None `. And for the third assertion, when `n=35 `,
it also enters the `else `branch, and it then enters the loop with `i=2`as`n//2+1=18 > 2 `.
Then in the next step, since `n%↩→

134 While it is not obvious how to correct this program, another way to implement the
`is_not_prime() `function is just to first create a helper function to identify prime
numbers as `is_prime() `, and then simply `return not is_prime(x) `.↩→
