AUTOMATIC CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROMPTING
INLARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

ABSTRACT
Large language models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning
steps. Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.
CoT prompting has two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like “Let’s think step by
step” to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The other uses a few manual
demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an
answer. The superior performance of the second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-speciﬁc
demonstrations one by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging
LLMs with the “Let’s think step by step” prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one
by one, i.e., let’s think not just step by step, but also one by one . However, these generated chains
often come with mistakes. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we ﬁnd that diversity matters for
automatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT prompting method: Auto-
CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct demonstrations.
On ten public benchmark reasoning tasks with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently matches or exceeds the
performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations. Code is available

1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) [Brown et al., 2020, Thoppilan et al., 2022, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022]
have performed impressively on complex reasoning tasks by decomposing the multi-step problems into intermediate
steps before producing the answer. This reasoning process is elicited by a very recent technique: chain-of-thought
(CoT) prompting [Wei et al., 2022a].
CoT prompting can be categorized into two major paradigms. One adds a single prompt like “Let’s think step by step”
after the test question to facilitate the reasoning chains in LLMs [Kojima et al., 2022]. Since this prompting paradigm
is task-agnostic and does not need input-output demonstrations, it is called Zero-Shot-CoT (left of Figure 1). With
Zero-Shot-CoT, LLMs have shown to be decent zero-shot reasoners. The other paradigm is few-shot prompting with
manual reasoning demonstrations one by one [Wei et al., 2022a]. Each demonstration has a question and a reasoning
chain. A reasoning chain is composed of a rationale (a series of intermediate reasoning steps) and an expected answer.
With all the demonstrations being manually designed, this paradigm is referred to as Manual-CoT (right of Figure 1).
In practice, Manual-CoT has obtained stronger performance than Zero-Shot-CoT [Wei et al., 2022a, Kojima et al.,
2022]. However, this superior performance hinges on the hand-drafting of effective demonstrations. Speciﬁcally, the
hand-drafting involves nontrivial efforts in designs of both questions and their reasoning chains for demonstrations.
Moreover, human efforts for designing task-speciﬁc demonstrations are even more: different tasks, such as arithmetic
[Roy and Roth, 2015] and commonsense reasoning [Talmor et al., 2019], require different ways of demonstrations.
To eliminate such manual designs, we advocate another Auto-CoT paradigm to automatically construct demonstrations
with questions and reasoning chains. Speciﬁcally, Auto-CoT leverages LLMs with the “Let’s think step by step” prompt
to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one, i.e., let’s think not just step by step, but also one by one .

et al., 2022a] (using manually designed demonstrations one by one) with example inputs and outputs of an LLM.
However, we ﬁnd that this challenge cannot be effectively addressed by simple solutions. For example, given a test
question of a dataset, retrieving semantically similar questions and invoking Zero-Shot-CoT to generate reasoning
chains will fail. Although LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners, they are not perfect: Zero-Shot-CoT can still make
mistakes in reasoning chains.
To mitigate the effect of reasoning chain mistakes from Zero-Shot-CoT, our analysis shows that diversity of
demonstration questions is the key. Based on this insight, we propose an Auto-CoT method to automatically construct
demonstrations. Auto-CoT consists of two main steps. First, partition questions of a given dataset into a few clusters.
Second, select a representative question from each cluster and generate its reasoning chain using Zero-Shot-CoT with
simple heuristics.
We evaluate Auto-CoT on ten benchmark reasoning tasks including: (i) arithmetic reasoning (MultiArith [Roy and Roth,
2015], GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021], AQUA-RAT [Ling et al., 2017], SV AMP [Patel et al., 2021]); (ii) commonsense
reasoning (CSQA [Talmor et al., 2019], StrategyQA [Geva et al., 2021]); (iii) symbolic reasoning (Last Letter
Concatenation, Coin Flip) [Wei et al., 2022a]. Experimental results show that with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently
matches or exceeds the performance of Manual-CoT that requires manual designs. This indicates that LLMs can
perform CoT reasoning by automatically constructing demonstrations.
2 Related Work
This section reviews two lines of research that form the basis of this work: chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for
multi-step reasoning and in-context learning for inducing LLMs to learn from demonstrations.
2.1 Chain-of-thought Prompting
CoT prompting is a gradient-free technique of inducing LLMs to produce intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the
ﬁnal answer. Wei et al. [2022a] formally studied the topic of CoT prompting in language models. This technique elicits
LLMs to generate a coherent series of intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the ﬁnal answer to a question. Studies
have shown that LLMs can perform CoT reasoning with zero-shot prompting (Zero-Shot-CoT) [Kojima et al., 2022] or
manually written few-shot demonstrations (Manual-CoT) [Wei et al., 2022a].
Zero-Shot-CoT. Kojima et al. [2022] showed that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners whose generated rationales
have already reﬂected the CoT reasoning. This ﬁnding inspires our work to leverage the self-generated rationales for
demonstrations. Generating rationales by LLMs was shown to be practical in a recent work [Zelikman et al., 2022]. In
2

--- PAGE 3 ---
their work, an LLM is prompted to generate rationales and those rationales that lead to the correct answer are selected.
The selection requires a training dataset of questions with annotated answers. In contrast, our work considers a more
challenging scenario where only a set of test questions are given (without a training dataset), following CoT prompting
studies by Wei et al. [2022a] and Kojima et al. [2022].
Manual-CoT. Manual-CoT achieves stronger performance by eliciting the CoT reasoning ability with effective
manual demonstrations. The demonstrations for the reasoning process are manually designed. However, the human
efforts in designs of both questions and their reasoning chains are nontrivial. Instead of addressing this limitation, recent
studies mainly focus on hand-crafting more complex demonstrations or leveraging ensemble-like methods. One trend is
problem decomposition. In least-to-most prompting [Zhou et al., 2022], complex problems are reduced to sub-problems,
and then the sub-problems are solved sequentially. The other trend is to vote over multiple reasoning paths for a test
question. Wang et al. [2022a] introduced a self-consistency decoding strategy to sample multiple outputs of LLMs and
then took a majority over the ﬁnal answers. Wang et al. [2022b] and Li et al. [2022] introduced randomness in the input
space to produce more diverse outputs for voting. They used manually-designed demonstrations as the seed set and
generated additional rationales: leave one question from the seed set and use the remaining demonstrations to generate
rationales for this question by the LLM. Unlike the aforementioned research lines that rely on manually-designed
demonstrations, our work intends to eliminate manual designs with competitive performance.
2.2 In-Context Learning
CoT prompting is closely related to in-context learning (ICL) [Radford et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020]. ICL enables
LLMs to perform a target task by feeding a few prompted examples as part of the input. Without gradient update, ICL
allows a single model to perform various tasks universally. There are various research lines to improve the performance
of ICL: (i) retrieving related demonstrations to the test instance where the popular practice is dynamically retrieving
related training examples for a given test input [Rubin et al., 2022, Su et al., 2022]; (ii) augmenting with ﬁne-grained
information, such as incorporating task instruction [Mishra et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2022b, Sanh et al., 2022]; (iii)
manipulating output probabilities of LLMs instead of directly computing the likelihood of target labels [Holtzman et al.,
2021, Zhao et al., 2021, Min et al., 2022a].
Despite the success of ICL, studies [Liu et al., 2022a, Lu et al., 2022] have shown that the strength of ICL may vary
widely depending on the choice of in-context demonstrations [Liu et al., 2022b]. In detail, the formatting of the
prompt, such as wording or order of demonstrations, may lead to performance ﬂuctuations [Webson and Pavlick,
2022, Zhao et al., 2021]. A recent work [Min et al., 2022b] even questioned the necessity of ground-truth input-
output mapping: using incorrect labels in the examples only marginally lowers the performance. However, the
existing analysis of ICL is mainly based on standard classiﬁcation and multi-choice datasets that only have simple
<input!output> mappings. We discover that those ﬁndings may not be applicable to the CoT prompting scenario with
more complex <input !rationale!output> mappings. For example, mistakes in either the <input !rationale> mapping
or the <rationale!output> mapping will lead to a dramatic performance drop (Appendix A.1).
3 Challenge of Auto-CoT
As just discussed, the performance of ICL hinges on hand-crafted demonstrations. As reported in Manual-CoT [Wei
et al., 2022a], using demonstrations written by different annotators brings up to 28.2% accuracy disparity in a symbolic
reasoning task, while changing the order of demonstrations results in less than 2% changes in most tasks. This suggests
that the key challenge of Auto-CoT lies in automatically constructing demonstrations with good questions and their
reasoning chains.
Recall that Manual-CoT hand-crafts a few (e.g., 8) questions in demonstrations. With similarity-based retrieval methods
being widely adopted for prompting LLMs [Rubin et al., 2022, Su et al., 2022], a promising candidate solution is to
sample demonstration questions using similarity-based retrieval. We follow the more challenging assumption in CoT
studies [Wei et al., 2022a, Kojima et al., 2022] that only a set of test questions are given (without a training dataset).
Following Liu et al. [2022a], we use Sentence-BERT [Reimers and Gurevych, 2019] to encode questions. For each
question qtestin a test dataset, we sample demonstration questions qdemo
i (i= 1; : : : ; k ) from the rest of the questions.
We design a Retrieval-Q-CoT method to retrieve the top- k(e.g.,k= 8) similar questions based on cosine similarity.
To compare with this similarity-based method, we also test a relatively more diversity-based method: Random-Q-CoT ,
which randomly samples kother test questions for each test question.
Both Retrieval-Q-CoT and Random-Q-CoT invoke Zero-Shot-CoT [Kojima et al., 2022] to generate the reasoning chain
cdemo
i(rationale and answer) for each sampled question qdemo
i, as LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners [Kojima et al.,
2022]. We use GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020] with 175B parameters (text-davinci-002) for the LLM unless otherwise stated.

On a high level, both Retrieval-Q-CoT and Random-Q-CoT take the concatenation of qdemo
i; cdemo
ipairs ( i= 1; : : : ; k )
andqtestas input to predict the reasoning chain for qtest, which contains the answer in the end (like right of Figure 1).

Random-Q-CoT 86.2 47.6y36.2y
Retrieval-Q-CoT 82.8 48.0y39.7yTo our surprise, Retrieval-Q-CoT underperforms Random-Q-CoT
on the arithmetic dataset MultiArith [Roy and Roth, 2015] (Table
1). Note that the retrieval methods were originally proposed in
tasks with annotated labels [Rubin et al., 2022, Su et al., 2022],
however, invoking Zero-Shot-CoT does not guarantee entirely correct
reasoning chains. Thus, we hypothesize that the inferior performance
of Retrieval-Q-CoT is caused by incorrect reasoning chains by Zero-
Shot-CoT. To test this hypothesis, we experiment with Retrieval-Q-
CoT on two other datasets GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021] and AQuA
[Ling et al., 2017] that have training sets with annotated reasoning
chains. The results are shown with yin Table 1. Under the setting
with annotated reasoning chains, Retrieval-Q-CoT even outperforms
Manual-CoT. The result indicates that Retrieval-Q-CoT is effective
when human annotations are available.
Although human annotations are useful, such manual efforts are nontrivial. However, automatically generating reasoning
chains via Zero-Shot-CoT underperforms Manual-CoT, especially when the challenge of question sampling is not
addressed. To design more effective Auto-CoT, we need to understand its challenge better.
3.1 Retrieval-Q-CoT Fails due to Misleading by Similarity
Since Retrieval-Q-CoT uses a few prompting demonstrations like in Manual-CoT, Retrieval-Q-CoT is expected to
perform competitively as well. However, reasoning chains (both rationales and answers) in Retrieval-Q-CoT are
generated by Zero-Shot-CoT: they may have mistakes that lead to wrong answers. Let us simply call demonstrations
with wrong answers as wrong demonstrations . Intuitively, after similar questions to a test question are retrieved, wrong
demonstrations caused by Zero-Shot-CoT may mislead the same LLM to reason similarly with a wrong answer (e.g.,
replicating mistakes) for the test question. We refer to this phenomenon as misleading by similarity . We will investigate
whether misleading by similarity contributes to the inferior performance of Retrieval-Q-CoT.
Retrieval-Q-CoT Random-Q-CoT20304050Rate (%)
Figure 2: Unresolving Rate.To begin with, we invoke Zero-Shot-CoT on all the 600 questions
from the MultiArith dataset. Among them, we collect those 128
questions (denoted as Q) where Zero-Shot-CoT generates wrong
answers (error rate: 21:3% = 128 =600). As we mentioned, with
extra demonstrations, Retrieval-Q-CoT and Random-Q-CoT are
expected to perform more competitively than Zero-Shot-CoT. Among
Qwhere Zero-Shot-CoT fails, we call those where Retrieval-Q-CoT
or Random-Q-CoT still fail as their unresolved questions . We divide
the number of unresolved questions by 128 (number of questions in
Q) to calculate the unresolving rate . A higher unresolving rate means
that a method more likely still makes mistakes like Zero-Shot-CoT.
Figure 2 shows that the unresolving rate of Retrieval-Q-CoT (46.9%)
is much higher than Random-Q-CoT (25.8%). It indicates that with similar questions being sampled for test questions,
Retrieval-Q-CoT is negatively affected by misleading by similarity.
To show that unresolved questions of Retrieval-Q-CoT tend to be similar, we present a case study in Table 2. In the left
part, the retrieved demonstration questions are similar to the test question and ask “ how long will it take him to cook the
rest? ” The reasoning chains generated by Zero-Shot-CoT produce answers regarding “ the total of ” instead of “ the rest ”.
Following the demonstrations, Retrieval-Q-CoT also fails by misunderstanding the meaning of “ the rest ”. In contrast,
Random-Q-CoT correctly understands “ the rest ” better without making similar mistakes in the demonstrations, thanks
to relatively more diverse (random) demonstrations.
3.2 Errors Frequently Fall into the Same Cluster
Motivated by the observations in Table 2, we use k-means to partition all the 600 test questions into k= 8clusters,
where each cluster contains similar questions.2With these clusters and reasoning chains generated by Zero-Shot-CoT
2We use Sentence-BERT [Reimers and Gurevych, 2019] to encode questions and apply k-means for clustering.

the rest ?Q:Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. She put
44 pics into one album and put the rest into 5 different
albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A:Let’s think step by step. The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes.
That means it has taken him 7 * 3 minutes to cook those 7 potatoes.
That means it will take him 3 more minutes to cook each of the
remaining 2 potatoes. That means it will take him a total of 7 * 3 + 2
* 3 = 21 minutes to cook all 9 potatoes. The answer is 21. 7A:Let’s think step by step. Wendy uploaded 79 pictures
to Facebook. She put 44 pictures into one album. That
means she put the rest of the pictures into 5 different
albums. That means each album would have (79-44)/5 =
15 pictures in each album. The answer is 15. X
Q:A chef needs to cook 13 potatoes. He has already cooked 5. If
each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to

free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids,
how much would it cost for the group to eat?
A:Let’s think step by step. The chef has already cooked 5 potatoes.
That means it has taken him 30 minutes so far. There are 13 potatoes
in total. 5 have been cooked so far. That means there are 8 left to
cook. Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. That means it will take
the chef 48 minutes to cook the 8 remaining potatoes. In total, it will
take the chef 78 minutes to cook all 13 potatoes. The answer is 78. 7A:Let’s think step by step. There are 8 kids, so that
means there are 7 adults. Each adult meal costs $5, so
that means that the 7 adults will cost $5*7=$35. Now we
just need to add the two numbers together. $35+8=43$.
So it would cost $43 for the group to eat. The answer is
43.7
Q:A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes. He has already cooked 8. If
each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to
cook the rest ?Q:A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes. He has already
cooked 8. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, how
long will it take him to cook the rest ?
A:Let’s think step by step. The chef has already cooked 8 potatoes.
That means it has taken him 8 * 9 minutes to cook those 8 potatoes.
That means it will take him 9 minutes to cook each of the remaining
7 potatoes. That means it will take him a total of 8 * 9 + 7 * 9 = 135
minutes to cook all 15 potatoes. The answer is 135. 7A:Let’s think step by step. The chef needs to cook 15
potatoes. He has already cooked 8. That means he has to
cook 15-8=7 more potatoes. Each potato takes 9 minutes
to cook. That means it will take him 9*7=63 minutes to
cook the rest of the potatoes. The answer is 63. X
(in Section 3.1), now we are curious if certain clusters contain questions where Zero-Shot-CoT frequently fails. Thus,
we calculate the error rate (questions with wrong Zero-Shot-CoT answers / total questions) for each cluster.
123456780204060Error Rate (%)
Figure 3: Clusters of similar questions.As shown in Figure 3, there exists a cluster (Cluster 2) with frequent
Zero-Shot-CoT errors (52.3%). The phenomenon could be generic as
Zero-Shot-CoT may lack some skills to solve some common problems
in target tasks.3For convenience of descriptions, let us call the cluster
with the highest error rate as the frequent-error cluster (e.g., Cluster
2 in Figure 3). Therefore, the imperfect nature of generated reasoning
chains in a zero-shot fashion poses risks of retrieving multiple similar
questions inside a frequent-error cluster by using similarity-based
methods. For the test question in the frequent-error cluster, Retrieval-
Q-CoT more easily constructs demonstrations with multiple similar
mistakes. As a result, Retrieval-Q-CoT often makes similar mistakes
like Zero-Shot-CoT, reiterated by its higher unresolving rate in Figure
2.
3.3 Diversity May Mitigate Misleading by Similarity
The analysis so far compellingly shows that LLMs are still not perfect zero-shot reasoners; thus, we aim to mitigate the
effect of their Zero-Shot-CoT errors, especially to mitigate misleading by similarity in the design of Auto-CoT.
As we will show later (Section 5.5), presenting a small portion of mistakes (e.g., 1 or 2 wrong demonstrations out
of 8) would not harm the overall reasoning performance for test questions. Suppose that questions of all the wrong
demonstrations fall into the same frequent-error cluster; then sampling one question from every different cluster will
lead to a higher than 7=8 = 87 :5%chance to construct all the 8 correct demonstrations. Since different clusters reﬂect
diverse semantics of the questions, this clustering-based sampling method can be considered as diversity-based, which
is in sharp contrast to similarity-based Retrieval-Q-CoT. On one hand, sampling questions with diversity may mitigate
3We observe similar phenomena when changing the cluster number or using other datasets (Appendix A.2).
5

--- PAGE 6 ---
the effect of misleading by similarity (Section 3.1). On the other hand, if we took each demonstration as a kind of skill,
diverse demonstrations seem to cover more alternative skills for solving target questions: even though there still exists
a small portion (e.g., 1=8) of mistakes in the demonstrations, the performance will not be negatively affected (to be
shown in Figure 6).
Nevertheless, the clustering-based sampling method may still construct a small portion of wrong demonstrations, such
as from questions in the frequent-error cluster. As we will show later, some of these wrong demonstrations may be
eliminated with heuristics. For example, wrong demonstrations often come with long questions and long rationales.
Using simple and generic heuristics, such as only considering shorter questions with shorter rationales, further helps
mitigate the effect of imperfect Zero-Shot-CoT capabilities (Appendix C.2).
4 Auto-CoT: Automatic Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Based on the observations and considerations in Section 3, we propose an Auto-CoT method to construct demonstrations
with questions and reasoning chains automatically. Auto-CoT consists of two main stages: (i) question clustering:
partition questions of a given dataset into a few clusters; (ii) demonstration sampling: select a representative question
from each cluster and generate its reasoning chain using Zero-Shot-CoT with simple heuristics. The overall procedure
is illustrated in Figure 4.

Test Question
Figure 4: Overview of the Auto-CoT method. Different from Manual-CoT in Figure 1, demonstrations (on the right)
are automatically constructed one by one (total: k) using an LLM with the “Let’s think step by step” prompt.
4.1 Question Clustering
Since diversity-based clustering may mitigate misleading by similarity (Section 3.3), we perform cluster analysis for a
given set of questions Q. We ﬁrst compute a vector representation for each question in Qby Sentence-BERT [Reimers
and Gurevych, 2019]. The contextualized vectors are averaged to form a ﬁx-sized question representation. Then, the
question representations are processed by the k-means clustering algorithm to produce kclusters of questions. For
questions in each cluster i, sort them into a list q(i)= [q(i)
1; q(i)
2; : : :]in the ascending order of the distance to the center
of cluster i. This question clustering stage is summarized in Algorithm 1.
4.2 Demonstration Sampling
In the second stage, we need to generate reasoning chains for those sampled questions and then sample demonstrations
that satisfy our selection criteria.
6

--- PAGE 7 ---
More concretely, we construct a demonstration d(i)(concatenation of a question, a rationale, and an answer) for each
cluster i(i= 1; : : : ; k ). For cluster i, we iterate over questions in the sorted list q(i)= [q(i)
1; q(i)
2; : : :](obtained by
Algorithm 1) until satisfying our selection criteria. In other words, a question that is closer to the center of cluster i
is considered earlier. Say that the j-th closest question q(i)
jis being considered. A prompted input is formulated as:
[Q:q(i)
j. A:[P]], where [P]is a single prompt “Let’s think step to step”. This formed input is fed into an LLM using
Zero-Shot-CoT [Kojima et al., 2022] to output the reasoning chain consisting of the rationale r(i)
jand the extracted
answer a(i)
j. Then, a candidate demonstration d(i)
jfor the i-th cluster is constructed by concatenating the question,
rationale, and answer: [Q:q(i)
j;A:r(i)
ja(i)
j].
Similar to the criteria of the hand-crafting demonstrations in Wei et al. [2022a], our selection criteria follow simple
heuristics to encourage sampling simpler questions and rationales: set the selected demonstration d(i)asd(i)
jif it has a
question q(i)
jwith no more than 60tokens and a rationale r(i)
jwith no more than 5reasoning steps.4

[P]]. This input is fed to LLMs to obtain the reasoning chain with the answer in the end for qtest(right of Figure 4).
5 Experiments
We brieﬂy describe the experimental setup and present main experimental results. More experimental details and results
can be found in the appendices.
5.1 Experimental setup
Tasks and Datasets. Our method is evaluated on ten benchmark datasets from three categories of reasoning tasks:
(i) arithmetic reasoning (MultiArith [Roy and Roth, 2015], GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021], AddSub [Hosseini et al.,
2014], AQUA-RAT [Ling et al., 2017], SingleEq [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2015], SV AMP [Patel et al., 2021]); (ii)
commonsense reasoning (CSQA [Talmor et al., 2019], StrategyQA [Geva et al., 2021]); (iii) symbolic reasoning (Last
Letter Concatenation, Coin Flip) [Wei et al., 2022a].
Implementation. We use the public GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020] of the text-davinci-002 version with 175B parameters
for the LLM [Ouyang et al., 2022] unless otherwise stated. We select this LLM because it has the strongest CoT
reasoning performance among public LLMs, as reported in Kojima et al. [2022] and Wei et al. [2022a]. We also evaluate
the Codex model [Chen et al., 2021] (code-davinci-002) as the LLM. Following Wei et al. [2022a], the number of
demonstrations kis 8 except for AQuA and Letter (4), CSQA (7), and StrategyQA (6).
4Because Zero-Shot-CoT often uses “ nn” for separating the reasoning steps, the rule can be easily implemented by counting the
“nn” tokens in the generated rationales.

Baselines. We compare our methods with four baseline methods: Zero-Shot [Kojima et al., 2022], Zero-Shot-CoT
[Kojima et al., 2022], Few-Shot [Wei et al., 2022a], and Manual-CoT [Wei et al., 2022a]. Zero-Shot-CoT and Manual-
CoT are illustrated in Figure 1. The Zero-Shot baseline concatenates a test question with the prompt “The answer is” as
the LLM input. The Few-Shot baseline has the same LLM input as Manual-CoT except for removed rationales from all
the demonstrations.
5.2 Competitive Performance of Auto-CoT on Ten Datasets

categories of reasoning tasks. The Zero-Shot and Zero-
Shot-CoT results are taken from Kojima et al. [2022], the
Few-Shot and Manual-CoT results are taken from Wei
et al. [2022a], and the Auto-CoT results are averaged
over three random runs. Overall, Auto-CoT consistently
matches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm
that requires manual designs of demonstrations. Due to
the cost of manual designs, Manual-CoT may design the
same demonstrations for multiple datasets (e.g., 5=6of the
arithmetic datasets). In contrast, Auto-CoT is more ﬂexible and task-adaptive: every single dataset gets its own
demonstrations that are automatically constructed.
5.3 Visualization of Question Clustering
Figure 5 visualizes question clustering (with PCA projection) in ten datasets. The illustration indicates that there exist
generic patterns, where different patterns may be characterized by questions from different clusters. We present the
constructed demonstrations of Auto-CoT in Appendix D.

5.4 General Effectiveness Using the Codex LLM
To evaluate the general effectiveness of Auto-CoT using different LLMs, here we change the LLM to the Codex model
[Chen et al., 2021]. As in Table 4, the Codex LLM leads to performance improvement for Manual-CoT when compared
with Table 3 that uses the GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) LLM. Nonetheless, using the Codex LLM, the overall performance
of Auto-CoT is still competitive compared to Manual-CoT, providing additional empirical evidence for the effectiveness
of Auto-CoT.
5.5 Effect of Wrong Demonstrations
Recall our discussions in Section 3.3 that there can be wrong demonstrations (whose answers are wrong). To see if
diversity mitigates this effect, we design an In-Cluster Sampling baseline that constructs demonstrations by randomly
sampling questions from the same cluster that contains a test question. Figure 6 compares accuracy with varying
amounts of wrong demonstrations on MultiArith. Compared with In-Cluster Sampling, Auto-CoT (using diversity-based
clustering) is less affected by wrong demonstrations: its performance still does not degrade signiﬁcantly even when
presented with 50% wrong demonstrations.

5.6 More Challenging Streaming Setting
CoT studies commonly assume that a full dataset with test questions is given [Wei et al., 2022a, Kojima et al., 2022].
Based on the given dataset, Auto-CoT samples questions to construct the demonstrations. Nonetheless, now we consider
a more challenging streaming setting where a small batch of test questions (say mquestions) arrive at a time like in
data streams.
To address this challenge, we extend Auto-CoT to a bootstrapping version Auto-CoT*: (i) Initialize an empty set M0;
(ii) When batch 1of questions q(1)
1; : : : ; q(1)
marrive, invoke Zero-Shot-CoT (no clustering due to small m) for each
q(1)
ito obtain its reasoning chain c(1)
i. Add question-chain pairs (q(1)
1; c(1)
1); : : : ; (q(1)
m; c(1)
m)toM0and call the new set
M1; (iii) When batch b(b >1) of questions q(b)
1; : : : ; q(b)
marrive, construct demonstrations with existing questions and
reasoning chains in Mb 1(like Auto-CoT) and use the demonstrations for in-context reasoning for each q(b)
i. Add
question-chain pairs (q(b)
1; c(b)
1); : : : ; (q(b)
m; c(b)
m)toMb 1and call the new set Mb.
Figure 7 compares the accuracy on MultiArith at each batch ( m= 30 ) in this streaming setting (extended version:
Figure 11 in the Appendix). As expected, for batch 1, Auto-CoT* and Zero-Shot-CoT obtain equal accuracy. From
batch 2, Auto-CoT* performs comparably with Manual-CoT. This result indicates that our method is still effective in
the more challenging streaming setting.
6 Conclusion
LLMs have shown reasoning capabilities with CoT prompting. The superior performance of Manual-CoT hinges on the
hand-crafting of demonstrations. To eliminate such manual designs, we proposed Auto-CoT to automatically construct
demonstrations. It samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct demonstrations.
Experimental results on ten public benchmark reasoning datasets showed that with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently
matches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.

the demonstration components to see how the performance changes. According to the results in Table 5, shufﬂing
questions has the least performance reduction ( 91:7%!73:8%). A possible reason for the decent performance is that
the model may capture the rationale-answer mapping patterns. The pattern is expected to reﬂect how the intermediate
reasoning steps can lead to the ﬁnal answer. This ﬁnding shows that it is possible to leverage the generated rationales
by Zero-Shot-CoT because those rationales are often logically correct even though they may lead to wrong answers
[Kojima et al., 2022].
Table 5: Impact of different components in the demonstrations.
Method Accuracy
Manual-CoT 91.7
Shufﬂe Questions 73.8
Shufﬂe Rationales 43.8
Shufﬂe Answers 17.0
In contrast, shufﬂing either rationales or answers reduces the accuracy signiﬁcantly ( 91:7%!43:8%=17:0%). The
observation indicates that the rationale-answer consistency is critical. This kind of mismatch actually happens in
Zero-Shot-CoT. An example is shown in Table 6. Using such demonstrations might teach the model illusion—predicting
answers without basis.

used for the test question in the second block.
Q:For the school bake sale Wendy made pastries. She baked 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies. After the sale she had 24 to take back
home. How many pastries did she sell?
A:Let’s think step by step. Wendy made 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies. She sold some pastries. She had 24 to take back home.
How many pastries did she sell?We can set up an equation to solve this problem. Wendy made 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies. She
sold some pastries. She had 24 to take back home. How many pastries did she sell?We can set up an equation to solve this
problem. 4 cupcakes + 29 cookies - pastries sold = 24 past. The answer is 29. 7
Q:A chef needs to cook 13 potatoes. He has already cooked 5. If each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, how long will it take
him to cook the rest?
A:Let’s think step by step. A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes. He has already cooked 8. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook,
how long will it take him to cook the rest?We can set up an equation to solve this problem. A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes.
He has already cooked 8. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?We can set up an
equation to solve this problem. 8 potatoes + (15-8) potatoes = 15 potatoes. The answer is 72 minutes. 7
A.2 Observation of frequent-error clusters
To verify if Zero-Shot-CoT fails at similar problems, we cluster the questions into a few clusters and calculate the
error rate of the answers to the questions in each cluster. As shown in Figure 8, the mistakes tend to gather in one
or more clusters across different datasets. We observe a similar phenomenon when the cluster number changes, as
shown in Figure 9. The phenomenon has shown to be generic that Zero-Shot-CoT may lack some skills to solve
some common problems in target tasks. We call the cluster with the highest error rate as a frequent-error cluster.
Therefore, the imperfect nature of generated reasoning chains poses risks of retrieving a set of similar questions inside
the frequent-error cluster for similarity-based retrieval.
B Experimental Details
B.1 Tasks and Datasets
Our method is evaluated on ten benchmark datasets that cover arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and
symbolic reasoning tasks. The statistics of the datasets are shown in Table 7.

Arithmetic Reasoning. For arithmetic reasoning, we consider the following six datasets: (i) MultiArith [Roy and
Roth, 2015], (ii) GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021], (iii) AddSub [Hosseini et al., 2014], (iv) AQUA [Ling et al., 2017], (v)
SingleEq [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2015], and (vi) SV AMP [Patel et al., 2021]. The ﬁrst three are from the classic
Math World Problem Repository [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016], and the last three are from more recent benchmarks.
Commonsense Reasoning. For commonsense reasoning, we use (i) CommonsenseQA (CSQA) [Talmor et al., 2019]
and (ii) StrategyQA [Geva et al., 2021]. CommonsenseQA asks questions with complex semantics that often require
reasoning based on prior knowledge [Talmor et al., 2019]. StrategyQA requires models to infer an implicit multi-hop
reasoning to answer questions [Geva et al., 2021].
Symbolic Reasoning. For symbolic reasoning, we use (i) Last Letter Concatenation [Wei et al., 2022a] and (ii) Coin
Flip tasks [Wei et al., 2022a]. Last letter Concatenation requires the model to concatenate the last letters of each word.
The goal of Coin Flip is to answer whether a coin is still heads up after people either ﬂip or do not ﬂip the coin.

B.2 Implementation Details
We use GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020] of the text-davinci-002 version with 175B parameters for the LLM [Ouyang et al.,
2022] unless otherwise stated. We select the model because it is public and is widely used to assess the ability of CoT
14

--- PAGE 15 ---
reasoning in LLMs [Wei et al., 2022a, Kojima et al., 2022]. The model is accessed via the OpenAI API.5Greedy
decoding is used to generate the output. We set max_tokens = 256 and temperature = 0. Following Wei et al. [2022a],
the number of demonstrations kused for in-context learning is 8 in most tasks, except for 4 in AQuA and Last Letter
Concatenation, 7 in CSQA, and 6 in StrategyQA.
C Analysis
C.1 Comparisons of criteria for sorting questions
We compare different ways of sorting questions in each cluster, including: (i) minimal distance to the cluster center
(In-Cluster Min Dist, as adopted in Auto-CoT), (ii) maximal distance to the cluster center (In-Cluster Max Dist), and
(iii) random sampling inside the cluster (In-Cluster Random). To alleviate the inﬂuence of wrong demonstrations, we
only sample the demonstrations with correct answers for this analysis.
Table 8: Inﬂuence of demonstration sampling.
Method MultiArith
Auto-CoT 93.7
In-Cluster Min Dist 93.7
In-Cluster Random 89.2
In-Cluster Max Dist 88.7
Comparing the results in Table 8, we see that the demonstrations are generally better if they are closer to the cluster
center.
C.2 Effectiveness of the simple heuristics
In Section 4, we apply simple heuristics to encourage the model to use simple and accurate demonstrations. Similar to
the criteria of the hand-crafting demonstrations in Wei et al. [2022a], our selection criteria follow simple heuristics to
encourage sampling simpler questions and rationales: set the selected demonstration d(i)asd(i)
jif it has a question q(i)
j
with no more than 60tokens and a rationale r(i)
jwith no more than 5reasoning steps.6For arithmetic reasoning tasks
except for AQuA (because it is a multiple-choice problem), we require that a(i)
jis not empty and appears in r(i)
j7to
mitigate the risk of rationale-answer mismatches (as we ﬁnd that such mistakes are harmful in Appendix A.1). If the
question, rationale, and the answer satisfy the conditions above, then a candidate demonstration d(i)
jfor the i-th cluster
is constructed by concatenating the question, rationale, and answer: [Q:q(i)
j;A:r(i)
ja(i)
j].
Table 9: Average mistakes in three runs of demonstration construction.

w/o heuristics 1.3 5 3 2.7 2 3.3 3.3 2.3 3 1
We run the demonstration construction process three times before and after using simple heuristics to quantify its effect.
Table 9 shows the comparison. The simple heuristics reduce the average number of wrong rationales in constructing
demonstrations. Figure 10 further depicts the error rate with and without the simple heuristics. The error rate is
computed by the average number of wrong rationales divided by the number of demonstrations. We see that our method
can keep the error rate below 20% in most tasks ( 7=10).
5Our experiments are run between July-2022 and September-2022 by using OpenAI API.
6Because Zero-Shot-CoT often uses “ nn” for separating the reasoning steps, the rule can be easily implemented by counting the
“nn” tokens in the generated rationales.
7In arithmetic reasoning tasks, rationales often infer their answers at the last few tokens, as demonstrations examples shown in
Appendix D.

C.3 Extended: More Challenging Streaming Setting
In Section 5.6, we discussed the application of Auto-CoT in a more challenging streaming setting where a small batch
of test questions (say mquestions) arrive at a time like in data streams.
Due to page space limits, we only showed the results of the ﬁrst 10 batches (300 test questions in total) in Section 5.6.
In Figure 11, we illustrate the accuracy of each batch on all the 600 test questions in MultiArith. As expected, for batch
1, Auto-CoT* and Zero-Shot-CoT obtain equal accuracy. From batch 2, Auto-CoT* quickly performs comparably with
Manual-CoT. This result indicates that our method is still effective in the more challenging streaming setting.

Q:For Halloween Katie and her sister combined the candy they received. Katie had 8 pieces of candy while her
sister had 23. If they ate 8 pieces the ﬁrst night, how many pieces do they have left?
A:Let’s think step by step. Katie and her sister have a total of 8 + 23 = 31 pieces of candy. If they eat 8 pieces the
ﬁrst night, they have 31 - 8 = 23 pieces left. The answer is 23.
Q:A pet store had 78 puppies. In one day they sold 30 of them and put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage.
How many cages did they use?
A:Let’s think step by step. There are 78 puppies. 30 are sold, so that means there are 48 left. 48 divided by 8 is 6,
so that means there are 6 cages with 8 puppies in each. The answer is 6.
Q:A waiter had 14 customers to wait on. If 3 customers left and he got another 39 customers, how many customers
would he have?
A:Let’s think step by step. The waiter had 14 customers to wait on. If 3 customers left, that means he would have
11 customers left. If he got another 39 customers, that means he would have 50 customers in total. The answer is
50.
Q:Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it. If she had 5
shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
A:Let’s think step by step. There are 5 shelves of mystery books. Each shelf has 8 books. So that’s 40 mystery
books. There are 4 shelves of picture books. Each shelf has 8 books. So that’s 32 picture books. 40 + 32 = 72
books. The answer is 72.
Q:Wendy uploaded 45 pictures to Facebook. She put 27 pics into one album and put the rest into 9 different
albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A:Let’s think step by step. First, we know that Wendy uploaded 45 pictures in total. Second, we know that Wendy
put 27 pictures into one album. That means that Wendy put the remaining 18 pictures into 9 different albums. That
means that each album would have 2 pictures. The answer is 2.
Q:A trivia team had 7 members total, but during a game 2 members didn’t show up. If each member that did show
up scored 4 points, how many points were scored total?
A:Let’s think step by step. There were 7 members on the team, but 2 members didn’t show up. That means that
there were 5 members that did show up. Each member that showed up scored 4 points. So if 5 members each
scored 4 points, then the total number of points scored would be 5*4=20. The answer is 20.
Q:Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how
many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A:Let’s think step by step. Mike made $69 from mowing lawns. He spent $24 on new mower blades. That means
he has $45 left. Each game costs $5, so he could buy 9 games. The answer is 9.
Q:The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 42 students
wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A:Let’s think step by step. The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples for students lunches.
This means that they ordered a total of 51 apples. But, if only 42 students wanted fruit, This means that the school
cafeteria would have 9 apples leftover. The answer is 9.

Q:Sally picked 7 lemons and Mary picked 9 lemons from the lemon tree . How many lemons were picked in total
?
A:Let’s think step by step. Sally picked 7 lemons and Mary picked 9 lemons. So we can say that Sally picked 7
lemons and Mary picked 9 lemons. So we can say that 7 + 9 = 16 lemons were picked in total. The answer is 16.
Q:Gordon bought 3.42 pounds of fruit for a class party . The class ate 2.2 pounds of the fruit . How much fruit is ?
A:Let’s think step by step. Gordon bought 3.42 pounds of fruit. The class ate 2.2 pounds of the fruit. That means
that there is 3.42 - 2.2 = 1.22 pounds of fruit left. The answer is 1.22.
Q:Mary had 21 dimes and 38 pennies in her bank . Her dad borrowed 18 pennies from Mary . How many pennies
does she have now ?
A:Let’s think step by step. Mary had 21 dimes and 38 pennies in her bank. Her dad borrowed 18 pennies from
Mary. So now, Mary has 21 dimes and 20 pennies in her bank. The answer is 20.
Q:Joan found 72 seashells and 12 starﬁshes on the beach . She gave Alyssa some of her seashells . She has 28
seashell . How many seashells did she give to Alyssa ?
A:Let’s think step by step. Joan found 72 seashells and 12 starﬁshes. She gave Alyssa some of her seashells. So
we need to ﬁnd out how many seashells she gave to Alyssa. Joan has 28 seashells. So she gave Alyssa 44 seashells.
The answer is 44.
Q:Last year , 90171 people were born in a country , and 16320 people immigrated to it . How many new people
began living in the country last year ?
A:Let’s think step by step. First, 90171 people were born in the country. Then, 16320 people immigrated to the
country. That means there were 90171 + 16320 = 106491 new people living in the country last year. The answer is
106491.
Q:A construction company is repaving a damaged road . So far , they have repaved a total of 4938 inches of the
road . Today , they repaved 805 inches of the road . How many inches of the road had they repaved before today ?
A:Let’s think step by step. The company has repaved a total of 4938 inches of the road. Today, they repaved 805
inches of the road. So before today, they had repaved 4938 - 805 = 4133 inches of the road. The answer is 4133.
Q:There are 5 scissors and 3 pencils in the drawer . Jason placed 4 scissors in the drawer . How many scissors are

Q:Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The
next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. What’s the distance covered by each train in the two days?
A:Let’s think step by step. On the ﬁrst day, both trains travel 80 miles. So the ﬁrst train covers 80 miles, and the
second train covers 80 miles. On the second day, both trains travel 150 miles. So the ﬁrst train covers 150 miles,
and the second train covers 150 miles. In total, the ﬁrst train covers 230 miles, and the second train covers 230
miles. The answer is 230.
Q:A tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water. On Wednesday,
the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. What is the tank’s water depth on Wednesday?
A:Let’s think step by step. On Monday, the depth was 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth was 7 feet more than on
Monday, so the depth was 24 feet. On Wednesday, the depth was two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the
depth was 16 feet. The answer is 16.
Q:While at the dollar store, Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store. The next day, she counts 50 more
customers than the ﬁrst day. If the total number of customers by the third day was 500, how many customers did
she count on the third day?
A:Let’s think step by step. On the ﬁrst day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50
more customers than she did on the ﬁrst day. So, she counted 150 customers on the second day. On the third day,
she counted 500 customers. Therefore, on the third day, Sloane counted 500 customers. The answer is 500.
Q:Laurel’s friend gave her 24 baby outﬁts that her child no longer needed. At her baby shower, Laurel received
twice the amount of new baby outﬁts. Then, Laurel’s mom gifted her with another 15 baby outﬁts. How many
outﬁts does she have for her baby?
A:Let’s think step by step. Laurel’s friend gave her 24 baby outﬁts. So she has 24 baby outﬁts. At her baby
shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outﬁts. So she has 48 baby outﬁts. Then, Laurel’s mom
gifted her with another 15 baby outﬁts. So she has 63 baby outﬁts. The answer is 63.
Q:Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times while Fred rode it 4 times. After that, each
of them decided to ride the luge 2 times. If each ride cost 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?
A:Let’s think step by step. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times. So, that’s 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. Fred rode the roller
coaster 4 times. So, that’s 4 * 6 = 24 tickets. Pam rode the luge 2 times. So, that’s 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. Fred rode the
luge 2 times. So, that’s 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. In total, they used 12 + 24 + 12 + 12 = 60 tickets. The answer is 60.
Q:The eighth-grade class held a bake-off. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Josh made one-fourth
the number of cookies that Suzanne made. If Suzanne made 36 cookies, how many did Kelsie make?
A:Let’s think step by step. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. So if Suzanne made
36 cookies, Josh made 9 cookies. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So if Josh made 9 cookies,
Kelsie made 18 cookies. The answer is 18.
Q:Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. If she continues to save the same amount
each week, how many more weeks will it take for her to have saved a total of $60?
A:Let’s think step by step. Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. That means she
has $32 in savings so far. $60 - $32 = $28 $28 / $4 = 7 It will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60.
The answer is 7.
Q:Mia and Emma are currently 16 years apart in age. If Mia, who is younger than Emma, is 40 years old, what’s
the average of their ages?
A:Let’s think step by step. Mia is currently 16 years old. Mia is younger than Emma. Mia is 40 years old.
Therefore, Emma must be 40 + 16 = 56 years old. The average of their ages is (40 + 56)/2 = 48 years old. The
answer is 48.

Q:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet.
What is the length of the other side of the yard? Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E)
60 feet
A:Let’s think step by step. We know that the yard is rectangular, so it has four sides. We also know that one side
of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. We can set up the equation: 3,000 =
100x x = 30 So, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet. The answer is A.
Q:In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green
sweets, how many red sweets are there? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 80 (C) 95 (D) 100 (E) 85
A:Let’s think step by step. There are 3 red sweets for every 4 green sweets. That means that for every 12 sweets,
there are 9 red sweets. That means that for every 120 green sweets, there are 90 red sweets. The answer is (A). The
answer is A.
Q:A car ﬁnishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours,
how much speed does the car gain? Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E)
80 kmph
A:Let’s think step by step. The car is currently travelling at 60 km/hr. In order to travel the same distance in 10
hours, the car would need to travel at 6 times the speed, or 360 km/hr. Therefore, the car would need to gain 300
km/hr. The answer is C. The answer is C.
Q:Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your
money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 60 (C) 28 (D) 26 (E)
18
A:Let’s think step by step. If Mark has Rs.75, then John has Rs.75 as well. If Mark gives John half his money,
then Mark will have Rs.37.50 and John will have Rs.112.50. However, this isn’t one of the answer choices. If
Mark gives John one third of his money, then Mark will have Rs.50 and John will have Rs.100. This is one of the
answer choices, so John must have had Rs.100 to begin with. The answer is D.

Q:Mark’s father gave him $85. Mark bought 10 books, each of which cost $5. How much money does Mark have
left?
A:Let’s think step by step. Mark’s father gave him $85. Mark bought 10 books, each of which cost $5. That
means that Mark spent $50 on books. So Mark has $85 - $50 = $35 left. The answer is 35.
Q:Tim has 44 books. Sam has 52 books. How many books do they have together ?
A:Let’s think step by step. Step 1: How many books does Tim have? Step 2: How many books does Sam have?
Step 3: How many books do they have together? Tim has 44 books. Sam has 52 books. They have 96 books
together. The answer is 96.
Q:There are 22 walnut trees currently in the park. Park workers will plant more walnut trees today. When the
workers are ﬁnished there will be 55 walnut trees in the park. How many walnut trees did the workers plant today ?
A:Let’s think step by step. There are currently 22 walnut trees in the park. The workers will plant more walnut
trees today. When the workers are ﬁnished, there will be 55 walnut trees in the park. The workers planted 33
walnut trees today. The answer is 33.
Q:Karen added 0.25 of a cup of walnuts to a batch of trail mix. Later, she added 0.25 of a cup of almonds. How
many cups of nuts did Karen put in the trail mix in all?
A:Let’s think step by step. Karen added 0.25 of a cup of walnuts to a batch of trail mix. This is the ﬁrst step, and
so far, she has added 0.25 cups of walnuts. Later, she added 0.25 of a cup of almonds. This is the second step, and
so far, she has added 0.5 cups of nuts (0.25 cups of walnuts + 0.25 cups of almonds). Therefore, in total, Karen has
added 0.5 cups of nuts to the trail mix. The answer is 0.5.
Q:Sara, Keith, Benny, and Alyssa each have 96 baseball cards. How many dozen baseball cards do they have in
all?
A:Let’s think step by step. There are 12 dozens in a gross, so we need to divide 96 by 12. 96/12=8 Therefore, they
have 8 dozens of baseball cards in all. The answer is 8.
