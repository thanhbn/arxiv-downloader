Abstract
The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks depends
heavily on prompt design, with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and self-consistency
being critical methods that enhance this ability. However, these methods do not
fully exploit the answers generated by the LLM to guide subsequent responses.
This paper proposes a new prompting method, named Progressive-Hint Prompting
(PHP), that enables automatic multiple interactions between users and LLMs by
using previously generated answers as hints to progressively guide toward the
correct answers. PHP is orthogonal to CoT and self-consistency, making it easy
to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve performance. We
conducted extensive and comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks. The
results show that PHP significantly improves accuracy while remaining highly
efficient. For instance, with text-davinci-003, we observed a 4.2% improvement on
GSM8K with greedy decoding compared to Complex CoT, and a 46.17% reduction
in sample paths with self-consistency. With GPT-4 and PHP, we achieve state-of-
the-art performances on SV AMP (89.1% →91.9%), GSM8K (92% →95.5%),
AQuA (76.4% →79.9%) and MATH (50.3% →53.9%).
1 Introduction
While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various
NLP tasks [ 1–3], their ability to reason is often perceived as a limitation that cannot be overcome
merely by increasing the scale of the model [ 4,5]. Prompt engineering in large-scale models has
shown comparable or superior performance to full training set fine-tuning in enhancing reasoning
ability, while also being significantly more sample-efficient [ 6,7]. One area of research that aims
to address this limitation is the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches to promote intermediate
reasoning steps [ 8–10]. Other works in this area, such as Least-to-Most [ 9] and Complex CoT [ 10],
have also explored this direction. Another area of research is self-consistency-related approaches. In
comparison to CoT-related work that focuses on designing better prompts, self-consistency proposes
to sample multiple answers from the LLMs and arrive at the correct answer through a majority
vote [ 10]. This approach is further improved upon by complex-based selection [ 10]. CoT-related and
self-consistency-related works can be seamlessly combined without any conflict.
Prior research has not explored the potential of leveraging the outputs of LLM to refine reasoning
paths iteratively. It stands to reason that similar to human cognition, LLM could benefit from
reevaluating and adjusting its generated reasoning paths in order to correct errors and enhance overall
performance. In this paper, we propose a new method named Progressive-Hint Prompting (PHP) that
involves sequentially interacting with LLM to approach the correct answer gradually. The method
operates as follows: (1) given a question, we ask the LLM to provide a Base Answer; (2) we combine

Progressive -Hint PromptingFigure 1: Our proposed Progressive-Hint Prompting method combines the generated answers and
questions for double-checking purposes, which is divided into two stages. In the first stage, we
generate a base answer by passing to the LLM a concatenation of the current question and a base
prompt , such as CoT or Complex CoT. In the second stage, we generate the subsequent answers via
the corresponding progressive-hint prompt , such as Progressive-Hint Prompting CoT (PHP-CoT)
or Progressive-Hint Prompting Complex CoT (PHP-Complex CoT), for the subsequent interaction.

the question and answer to re-ask the LLM and obtain the Subsequent Answer; (3) we repeat the
operation in (2) until the answer is stable and does not change over the last two answers. PHP follows
a human-like thought process where previous answers are leveraged as hints to arrive at the correct
answer after re-evaluating the question.
Figure 1 illustrates the proposed PHP framework. We use the base prompt to obtain the initial base
answer, and then employ the PHP prompt for subsequent questions. If the current answer matches the
previous answer, it is more likely to be correct, and we terminate the LLM inquiry. With Complex
CoT and GPT-4, after adding PHP, the performance achieves SOTA with 91.9% on SV AMP [ 11],
95.5% on GSM8K [12], and 79.9% on AQuA [13] and 53.9% on MATH [14].
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
•We propose a new method, Progressive-Hint Prompting (PHP), alongside CoT and self-
consistency, for improving LLM reasoning abilities.
•We demonstrate the effectiveness of PHP through extensive experimentation, including
baseline comparisons and ablation studies, using four LLMs, text-davinci-002 and text-
davinci-003, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 [15–17].
•The experiment results show that our method can also improve performance with self-
consistency.
•We believe that progressive-hint prompting represents an important step towards automatic
sequential interaction with LLMs and hope that it inspires future research in this field.
2 Related Work
Emergent Abilities and Multi-Step Reasoning. LLMs are particularly skilled at in-context learning,
which involves adhering to the structure of prompts (typically few-shot) and completing corresponding
2

--- PAGE 3 ---
tasks [ 15,18–20]. Among the diverse range of language comprehension tasks, we are particularly
interested in multi-step reasoning because it exhibits two unique features. Firstly, LLMs significantly
outperform smaller models on multi-step reasoning tasks [ 8], whereas their performance gains on
tasks like sentiment classification can be limited [ 19]. Secondly, few-shot prompting outperforms full
training set fine-tuning in multi-step reasoning tasks, even when conducted on LLMs [7].
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [ 8] is a prominent work that
demonstrates the multi-step reasoning capacities of LLMs. This approach suggests that the reasoning
ability can be elicited through a chain of thoughts, where an answer directly follows a question
without intermediate reasoning steps. Least-to-Most prompting [ 9], which follows the same research
direction, divides reasoning into problem breakdown parts and problem answer parts and describes
the reasoning steps in more detail. Similarly, the complex CoT [ 10] highlights the importance of
prompt complexity and selects the most complex questions and their answers as prompts. To reduce
the human workload, the Auto-CoT is proposed [ 21]. Other works have found that using specific
phrases like "Let’s think step by step" [6] can improve performance.
Reasoning Path Extraction. Previous research has investigated various task-specific methods for
identifying reasoning paths, including constructing semantic graphs [ 22], developing Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) models to retrieve reasoning paths from a Wikipedia graph [ 23], using
human-annotated reasoning paths on math problems for fine-tuning [ 12], or training an extractor with
heuristic-based pseudo reasoning paths [ 24]. A novel research work, named Self-Consistency [ 25],
couples the generation of reasoning paths and a final answer by sampling from the decoder and
using aggregation to retrieve the most consistent answer without extra modules. This approach has
shown great promise, and it has the potential to outperform existing methods in terms of accuracy.
Furthermore, the vote complex [ 10], rank and select samples via complexity, is proposed to improve
the self-consistency performance. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex
reasoning problems.

Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are
done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
A: There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after the Grove workers planted some more.
So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6 trees that were planted. The answer is 6.
Progressive-Hint Prompting 1: Hint is the correct answer
Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are
done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today? (Hint: The answer is
near to 6).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 6. With the Answer Hints: 6, we will answer the question. There are
15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after the Grove workers planted some more. So there
must have been 21 - 15 = 6 trees that were planted. The answer is 6.
Progressive-Hint Prompting 2: Hint is the incorrect answer
Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are
done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today? (Hint: The answer is
near to 10, 8).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 10, 8. With the Answer Hints: 10, 8, we will answer the question.
There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after the Grove workers planted some more.
So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6 trees that were planted. The answer is 6.
One salient aspect of humanity is our ability to not only think once, but to also double-check
our answers. In this paper, we propose that this process can be simulated in language models by
sequentially employing previous answers. In other words, a model can generate an answer and then
3

--- PAGE 4 ---
combine this with the question for the next round of thinking. If the current answer is the same as the
previous one, we can have confidence that the current answer is correct.
We have shown the Proposed Interaction in Figure 1 and Prompt Design in Table 1. We demonstrate
the process of generating PHP-CoT prompts for a given CoT prompt in Table 1 and provide the
complete prompt in the Appendix. Our pipeline is divided into two stages: (i) base answer & base
prompt : the generation of the base answer via base prompts such as CoT or Complex CoT and
(ii)subsequent answer & PHP : the subsequent interaction with the LLMs through corresponding
progressive-hint prompts like Progressive-Hint Prompting CoT (PHP-CoT) or Progressive-Hint
Prompting Complex CoT (PHP-Complex CoT). We propose a two-sentence structure for the PHP,
consisting of a phrase indicating the proximity of the answer at the question part followed by a
sentence rehearsing hints at answer part. For instance, to create a PHP prompt from a CoT prompt,
we first add the phrase "The answer is near to A1, ..., A p" after the initial question, where A1, ..., A p
represent possible answers. Next, we introduce the hints in the beginning sentence of the potential
answers: "We know the Answer Hints: A1, ..., A p. With the Answer Hints: A1, ..., A p, we will
answer the question.".
PHP Design Principle : we should consider various situations of hints. When we ask LLM questions,
we do not know what the answer will be so the hints are unknown. In this prompt design, we consider
the following two potential situations: 1) The hints are the same as the correct answer: to be sure that
the model can still get the correct answer when the hint is correct; 2) hints are not the same as the
correct answer: to be sure that the model can jump out of the incorrect answer.
Adhering to the above guidelines, we utilize the Standard prompt, CoT prompt, and Complex CoT
prompt to generate initial base answers, from which we can then develop the subsequent answer
generation prompts, namely, PHP-Standard prompt, PHP-CoT prompt, and PHP-Complex CoT
prompt, respectively. The stopping criterion in PHP is reached when two consecutive responses are
identical, signaling the end of the interactive exchange.
Overall, this method represents a pipeline for improving the quality of responses and enhancing
communication during question-answer scenarios.
4 Experiments
Datasets and Models. We evaluate PHP on seven datasets (AddSub [ 26], MultiArith [ 27], Sin-
gleEQ [ 28], SV AMP [ 11], GSM8K [ 12], AQuA [ 13]) and MATH [ 14]. We choose the datasets
because we focus on the reasoning ability of the model. The utilized for both the Standard and CoT
prompts are sourced from the original CoT paper [ 8], whereas the prompt utilized for the Complex
CoT [ 10] prompt is derived from the corresponding Complex CoT publication. Also, to validate
our proposed method performance, we employ four models: text-davinci-002 and text-davinci-003,
GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 [15–17]. All models are employed via OpenAI API key.
Prompts. We have shown the proposed process pipeline in the Method part. We show all the prompts
in the Appendix and supplementary materials.
4.1 Main Results
The main results of our study are presented in Table 2, with all methods using greedy decoding (i.e.
temperature = 0). Our findings indicate that the proposed PHP improves performance, particularly
when working with powerful prompts and models.
PHP works better when the LLM is more powerful . In terms of model power, our analysis indicates
that PHP is most effective when applied with powerful models. Specifically, when examining CoT
and Complex CoT prompts, we found that while text-davinci-002 generally yielded a performance
improvement after adding hints, there were occasions when performance would decline. However,
when we replaced text-davinci-002 with text-davinci-003, performance improvement became more
consistent and significant. For example, PHP-Complex CoT using text-davinci-002 improved perfor-
mance by 3.6%, but then increased further to 4.6% with text-davinci-003. Similarly, on AQuA dataset,
using PHP-Complex CoT resulted in a performance drop of 0.4% with text-davinci-002 but a 1.2%
improvement with text-davinci-003. The text-davinci-002 is finetuned with supervised instruction tun-
ing, while the text-davinci-003 is finetuned with reinforcement learning. The improved performance

Figure 2: The Interaction Number refers to the frequency at which we need to consult the LLM

observed that: 1) A stronger model leads to a decreased interaction number; 2) An improved prompt
results in an increased interaction number.
with text-davinci-003 can be attributed to its enhanced power, making it better at understanding and
employing the given hint.
PHP works better when the prompt is more powerful. After analyzing our data, it was determined
that the prompt’s power has a significant impact on the performance of the system. Our experimental
results revealed that while the inclusion of PHP produced modest improvements with standard
prompts, CoT and Complex CoT prompts demonstrated substantial gains in performance. Particularly
noteworthy is the fact that the most potent prompt, Complex CoT, exhibited the most substantial
performance improvement in comparison to the Standard prompt and CoT prompt. This finding
provides compelling evidence that a superior prompt leads to greater effectiveness of the system.
The Interaction Number decreases when the model is more powerful and the prompt is less
powerful. The number of interactions refers to how many times the agent engages with the LLMs.
The interaction number is one when the agent receives the first answer and increases to two for the
second answer. In Figure 2, we illustrate the interaction number of various models and prompts. Our
findings indicate that: 1) The interaction number for text-davinci-003 is typically lower than that
of text-davinci-002 when given the same prompt. This is primarily due to the higher accuracy of
text-davinci-003, resulting in a higher probability of the base answer and subsequent answers being
correct, thus requiring fewer interactions to obtain the final correct answer; 2) When using the same
models, the interaction number generally increases as the prompt becomes more powerful. This is
because the LLMs achieves better reasoning ability when the prompt becomes more potent, allowing
5

--- PAGE 6 ---
them to leverage the hints to jump out of the incorrect answers, and ultimately leading to a higher
number of interactions required to reach the final answer.
4.2 Impact of the Hint Quality

to the model and PHP generates the subsequent answers. The results are from text-davinci-003 with

The quality of the hint significantly affects the performance. Shown in Table 3, to enhance the
PHP-Standard, replacing the base prompt Standard with Complex CoT or CoT leads to a significant
improvement in the final performance. For PHP-Standard, we observe that GSM8K performance
amplifies from 16.0% with base prompt Standard to 50.2% with base prompt CoT and 60.3% with
base prompt Complex CoT. Conversely, replacing the base prompt Complex CoT with Standard will
reduce the final performance. For example, after replacing base prompt Complex CoT with Standard,
the performance of PHP-Complex CoT drops from 71.6% to 65.5% on GSM8K dataset.
Performance may further improve if PHP is not designed from the corresponding base prompt.
The results indicate that the CoT with PHP-Complex CoT achieved a high accuracy rate of 96.8%
on the MultiArith dataset, surpassing the performance of the CoT with PHP-CoT. Similarly, the
Complex CoT with PHP-CoT demonstrated a notable accuracy rate of 95.6% on the same dataset,
outperforming the Complex CoT with PHP-Complex CoT. The rationale behind these findings is
twofold: 1) the performance of CoT and Complex CoT are similar on all six datasets, and 2) since
the Base answer is provided by CoT (or Complex CoT) and the subsequent answer is based on
PHP-Complex CoT (or PHP-CoT), it is comparable to having two individuals collaborating to solve
a problem. Therefore, in such circumstances, the system’s performance may be further enhanced.
4.3 Ablation Study
Furthermore, we conducted an ablation study to verify the criticality of the two sentences in answers:
1) P1: We know the Answer Hints A1, ..., A p; 2) P2: With the Answer Hints A1, ..., A p, we will
answer the question. Moreover, we introduced a new type of prompt called CoT-Merge and Complex
CoT-Merge. Firstly, we combined the original prompt with the PHP prompt into a single file.
Subsequently, we utilized the same Merge Prompt for both the base answer and subsequent answers.
Also, we prove that both correct and incorrect hints are necessary in prompt design.
The Proposed P1 and P2 are necessary. Incorporating the sentences P1 and P2 resulted in better
performance for CoT with PHP across three of the six datasets. However, the significance of these
two sentences became particularly apparent when we employed Complex CoT. With this method,
better performance was achieved on five of the six datasets after adding P1 and P2. For instance,
Complex CoT improved its performance from 78.0% to 80.0% on the SV AMP dataset, and from
68.3% to 71.6% on the GSM8K dataset. This highlights that sentences P1 and P2 can exhibit more
potent abilities, particularly when the model’s logical capacity is superior. Consequently, we can
conclude that P1 and P2 will likely enhance model performance to a greater extent, particularly with
more powerful prompts and models.
Non-Merge based PHP is better than merge based PHP when prompts are more powerful. Re-
garding the CoT with PHP-CoT, the initial answer is derived from the CoT prompt, and subsequently,

experiment results, we see that both the proposed P1 and P2 are necessary. Meanwhile, non-merge
based method is better than merge based method when prompts are more powerful. The results are
from text-davinci-003 with greedy decoding.

the answer is obtained from the PHP-CoT. Notably, compared to other CoT-base methods, CoT-
Merge achieves the best performance. However, compared to other Complex CoT-based methods,
we observe that non-merge PHP-Complex CoT with both P1 and P2 achieves the best performance.
Hence, when prompts are better, the performance of non-merge based method will be better than
merge-based method.
Both correct and incorrect hints are needed in the prompt design. Table 5 demonstrates that the
use of PHP was superior to its absence when the designed prompt included both correct and incorrect
hints. Specifically, the provision of a correct hint in the prompt promoted the generation of answers
that matched the given hint. Conversely, the provision of incorrect answers in the prompt encouraged
the generation of alternative answers, with the aid of the given hint.
4.4 Performance with Self-Consistency
As we discussed before, our proposed method can combine with CoT and self-consistency to further
improve the model performance. The results are shown in Table 6. Following the self-consistency
paper, we sample paths with numbers 5, 10, 20 and 40, and the model temperature 0.7.
PHP further improves performance. By utilizing similar prompts and sample path numbers, we
discovered that our proposed PHP-CoT and PHP-Complex CoT always achieve superior performance
when compared to CoT and Complex CoT, shown in Table 6 and Figure 3. For instance, CoT with
self-consistency was able to attain a 96.5% accuracy on the MultiArith dataset with a sample path of
10, 20 and 40. Therefore, we can conclude that the best performance by CoT with self-consistency is
96.5% with text-davinci-003. However, after implementing PHP, the performance skyrocketed to

adding self-consistency. Meanwhile, PHP may reduce the cost of self-consistency.

Figure 3: We show the results: 1) CoT of MultiArith; 2) CoT of SV AMP; 3) Complex CoT of
GSM8K. According to 1) and 2), we can see that PHP could further improve performance. With
result 3), we found that the PHP could even reduce the cost of self-consistency.
97.1%. Similarly, we observed CoT with self-consistency on SV AMP, achieving the best accuracy
of 83.3% with 20 sampled paths, and further improved to 83.7% upon implementing PHP. This
illustrates that PHP could break the performance bottleneck and further improve performance.
PHP could reduce the cost of self-consistency. Incorporating the PHP can also lead to cost reduction.
It is widely acknowledged that self-consistency involves an increased number of reasoning paths,
resulting in a higher cost. The Table 6 illustrates that PHP can be an effective approach for reducing
this cost, while still preserving performance gains. As shown in Figure 3, using Complex CoT
with self-consistency, a 78.1% accuracy can be reached with 40 sample paths, while incorporating
PHP reduces the required sample amount to 10 ×2.1531=21.531 paths, and results in an even better
accuracy of 78.2%.
4.5 Performance with Chat Model

our experiments. With the release API of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, we validate the performance of

Complex CoT with PHP on the same six datasets. We use greedy decoding (i.e. temperature = 0) and
Complex CoT as prompt for both models.
Analyze GPT-3.5-Turbo. As depicted in Table 7, the proposed PHP enhances performance, improv-
ing 2.3% on GSM8K and 3.2% on AQuA. However, GPT-3.5-Turbo exhibits a reduced ability to
adhere to prompts compared to text-davinci-003. We provide two examples to illustrate this point: a)
In cases where the given hints are absent, GPT-3.5-Turbo fails to answer the question and responds
with a statement such as, "We cannot answer this question as the answer hint is missing. Please
provide the answer hint to proceed.". In contrast, text-davinci-003 autonomously generates and fills in
the missing answer hint before addressing the question (as demonstrated in the Appendix); b) When
more than ten hints are provided, GPT-3.5-Turbo may respond with "We cannot determine the correct
answer as multiple answer hints are given. Please provide only one answer hint for the question.".
Analyze GPT-4. After deploying the GPT-4 model, we were able to achieve the new SOTA per-
formance on the SV AMP, GSM8K, AQuA and MATH benchmarks. Our proposed PHP method
consistently improves the performance of GPT-4. Furthermore, compared to the GPT-3.5-Turbo
model, we observed a reduction in the number of interactions required by GPT-4, which aligns with
the finding that "The Interaction Number decreases when the model is more powerful."
5 Conclusion
This paper introduces a novel approach named Progressive-Hint Prompting (PHP) for interacting with
LLMs, which offers multiple advantages: 1) PHP achieves substantial performance improvements on
math reasoning tasks, leading to state-of-the-art results on several reasoning benchmarks; 2) with
more powerful models and prompts, PHP can better and consistently benefit the LLMs; 3) PHP can
be easily combined with CoT and self-consistency to further improve performance.
To better enhance the progressive-hint prompting approach, future research endeavors can focus on
improving the design of handcrafted hints in the question phase and prompt sentences in the answer
9

--- PAGE 10 ---
part. Additionally, novel hints that aid the LLMs to reconsider the questions can be identified and
extracted beside the answer.

6 Implementation Details
We have provided the code in our supplementary materials.
7 Limitation and Further Work
In this paper, we will explore the limitations of our proposed progressive-hint prompting technique
and discuss possible avenues for further improvement.
The Progressive-Hint Prompt is handcrafted. Our proposed progressive-hint prompts are hand-
crafted by humans, similar to other related techniques such as Chain-Of-Thought and Complex Chain
of Thought. As such, we aim to design Auto Progressive Hint in the future to improve its efficiency.
For instance, we could continuously build and update the progressive hint during testing.
The hint is defined as the answer. In this paper, we defined the hint as the answer. However, we
acknowledge that the concept of hint encompasses other possibilities generated by models. These
hints may include model confidence, reasoning path, and even interaction number.
The interaction number is at least two. Our design requires at least two interactions to determine
the final answers. Therefore, using greedy decoding (where the sample path is always 1) as opposed
to self-consistency can increase costs. Going forward, we plan to employ a powerful model initially
to obtain the base answer then rely on cheaper models for subsequent answers. This approach could
help us reduce the overall cost.
8 Broader Impacts
Progressive-Hint Prompting aims to enhance the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs)
by utilizing previous answers. We believe that the integration of PHP with LLM can be applied
in a variety of areas, including: 1) Assisting students, particularly those from low-income areas,
in learning more effectively and obtaining accurate answers with the help of LLM and PHP; 2)
Aiding mathematicians in solving complex mathematical problems; 3) and other reasoning-related
applications. By leveraging PHP with LLM, we hope to improve the performance of these models
and enable their use in various practical scenarios.
9 Model Response with Different Hints
Model Response with different hints. When presented with the hint 100, the model accurately
solves the question. Conversely, the model can be misled if the provided hint strays too far from the
correct answer. For instance, when the hint is 0, the model calculates the amount of not used carrots
is 80 pounds, outputs an answer of 0.
10 Interaction Cases
In this section, we provide more interaction cases.
14

--- PAGE 15 ---
Table 9: A GSM8K example of text-davinci-003 response with greedy decoding, and the prompt
is PHP-Complex CoT. Based on our analysis, it appears that a hint that is too far from the correct
answer has the potential to mislead LLMs and lead to an incorrect final answer. Conversely, a more
effective hint can result in a more precise outcome.
Question: 200 pounds of carrots will be distributed to 40 restaurants in a certain city. Each restaurant
is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots will not be used?
Hint: 0 .We know the Answer Hints: 0. With the Answer Hints: 0, we will answer the question. Let’s
think step by step We know that 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants. Each
restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. Therefore, 40 restaurants x 2 pounds of carrots = 80
pounds of carrots. The total amount of carrots used is 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds. The
amount of carrots not used is 200 pounds - 120 pounds = 80 pounds. The answer is 0
Hint: 100 . We know the Answer Hints: 100. With the Answer Hints: 100, we will answer the
question. Let’s think step by step We know that 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40
restaurants. Each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrots, so 40 restaurants x 2 pounds = 80
pounds of carrots. This means that 200 pounds of carrots - 80 pounds of carrots = 120 pounds of
carrots will not be used. The answer is 120
10.1 Success Case
Question: James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many
total meters does he run a week?
A: Let’s think step by step
James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs 3*3 = 9 sprints a week.
Each sprint is 60 meters, so he runs 9*60 = 540 meters a week.
The answer is 540.
Question: James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many

A: We know the Answer Hints: 540. With the Answer Hints: 540, we will answer the question. Let’s
think step by step James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters, so he runs 3 x 60
= 180 meters each time. He runs 3 times a week, so he runs 180 x 3 = 540 meters each week. The
answer is 540.
Question: Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where
each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.
One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in
precisely 55 seconds. The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter
leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.
Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?
A: Let’s think step by step
The first team will take 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds to complete the race.
The second team will take 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds to complete the race.
The first team will win by 220 - 222 = -2 seconds.

10.2 Failure Case
Question: Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing
seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy. She gives the chickens their feed in
three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon,
she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. How many cups of feed does she need to give her
chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi’s flock is 20 chickens?
A: Let’s think step by step
In the morning, Wendi gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed,
so 15 cups of feed is for 5 chickens.
In the afternoon, Wendi gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed,
so 25 cups of feed is for 8 chickens.
So, in total, Wendi has fed 5+8=13 chickens.
Since Wendi’s flock is 20 chickens, she needs to feed 20-13=7 more chickens.
Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed, so Wendi needs to give her chickens 7*3=21 cups of feed in the
final meal of the day.
The answer is 21.

--- PAGE 18 ---
In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.
This means that 15 cups of feed is enough for 5 chickens.
In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.
This means that 25 cups of feed is enough for 8 chickens.
So, she has already fed 13 chickens in the morning and afternoon.
She has 20 chickens in total, so she needs to feed 20-13 = 7 more chickens.
Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed, so she needs to give 7 chickens x 3 cups of feed = 21 cups of feed
in the final meal of the day.
The answer is 21.

rest are good. How many oranges are good?
A: Let’s think step by step
There are 25 oranges in the basket, of which 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour.
This means that 1 + 20% + 2 = 23 oranges are not good.
Therefore, 25 - 23 = 2 oranges are good.
The answer is 2.
Question: A basket contains 25 oranges among which 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, 2 are sour and the

A: We know the Answer Hints: 2. With the Answer Hints: 2, we will answer the question.
Let’s think step by step
There are 25 oranges in the basket.
1 is bad, so there are 24 oranges left.
20% of the oranges are unripe, so 20% of 24 = 4.8 oranges are unripe.
2 oranges are sour, so there are 24-4.8-2 = 17.2 oranges left.
The rest of the oranges are good, so the number of good oranges is 17.2.
The answer is 17.2.
Question: A basket contains 25 oranges among which 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, 2 are sour and the

Let’s think step by step
There are 25 oranges in the basket.
1 is bad, so there are 24 oranges left.
20% of 24 oranges are unripe, so 20% of 24 = 4.8 oranges are unripe.
2 oranges are sour, so there are 24-4.8-2 = 17.2 oranges left.
These 17.2 oranges are good.
The answer is 17.2.

10.3 Response when Miss Hint for GPT-3.5 Text-Divinci-003
Question: Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago,
the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much
water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now? (Hint: The answer is near
to ).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 16. With the Answer Hints: 16, we will answer the question.
Let’s think step by step
4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
This means that the small pool had 4 gallons of water.
In 4 minutes, the big pool has lost 4 gallons x 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water.
The small pool has also lost 4 gallons x 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water.
Therefore, the small pool now has 4 gallons - 16 gallons = -12 gallons of water.
Since it is impossible to have negative gallons of water, the small pool must have 0 gallons of water.
The answer is 0.

Base Complex Chain-Of-Thought
Question: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study
together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to
memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and
1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days
should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include
3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?
A: Let’s think step by step. Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2
chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.
For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6
hours total.
Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.
However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute
break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.
They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.
And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for
snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.
So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total. They
want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75 They will need to
plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.
The answer is 4
Question: Mark’s basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws. Their
opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws. What’s the total number
of points scored by both teams added together?
A: Let’s think step by step
Mark’s team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers.
His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers
They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free
throws.
All together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points
Mark’s opponents scored double his team’s number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100
points in 2 pointers.
His opponents scored half his team’s number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24/2= 12 points in 3
pointers.
They also scored half Mark’s team’s points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2=5 points in free
throws.
All together Mark’s opponents scored 100+12+5=117 points
The total score for the game is both team’s scores added together, so it is 84+117=201 points
The answer is 201
Question: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck
cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will
have if she currently has 60 marbles?
A: Let’s think step by step
When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she’ll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 =
24
The total number of marbles she’ll have is 60+24 = 84
If Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 =
30 frisbees.
If Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she’ll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.
The total number of frisbees she’ll have will increase to 30+12 = 42
Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards
If she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she’ll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards.
The total number of deck cards she’ll have is 10+4 = 14
25

--- PAGE 26 ---
Together, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items
The answer is 140
Question: A group of 4 fruit baskets contains 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three
baskets and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket. How many fruits are there?
A: Let’s think step by step
For the first three baskets, the number of apples and oranges in one basket is 9+15=24
In total, together with bananas, the number of fruits in one basket is 24+14=38 for the first three
baskets.
Since there are three baskets each having 38 fruits, there are 3*38=114 fruits in the first three baskets.
The number of apples in the fourth basket is 9-2=7
There are also 15-2=13 oranges in the fourth basket
The combined number of oranges and apples in the fourth basket is 13+7=20
The fourth basket also contains 14-2=12 bananas.
In total, the fourth basket has 20+12=32 fruits.
The four baskets together have 32+114=146 fruits.
The answer is 146
Question: You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly
split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1
apple cost if your total bill was $66?
A: Let’s think step by step
If 36 fruits were evenly split between 3 types of fruits, then I bought 36/3 = 12 units of each fruit
If 1 orange costs $0.50 then 12 oranges will cost $0.50 * 12 = $6
If my total bill was $66 and I spent $6 on oranges then I spent $66 - 6 =60 on the other 2 fruit types.
Assuming the price of watermelon is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price
and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A
If we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for $60, then we know that $60 = 12W + 12A
Knowing that 1W=4A, then we can convert the above to $60 = 12(4A) + 12A
60 = 48 A+ 12A
60 = 60A
Then we know the price of one apple (A) is $60/60= $1
The answer is 1
Question: Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with
only 300 students. At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers. She gained
40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in
the third week. Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90
new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.
After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have?
A: Let’s think step by step
After one week, Susy has 100+40 = 140 followers.
In the second week, Susy gains 40/2 = 20 new followers.
In the third week, Susy gains 20/2 = 10 new followers.
In total, Susy finishes the three weeks with 140+20+10 = 170 total followers.
After one week, Sarah has 50+90 = 140 followers.
After the second week, Sarah gains 90/3 = 30 followers.
After the third week, Sarah gains 30/3 = 10 followers.
So, Sarah finishes the three weeks with 140+30+10 = 180 total followers.
Thus, Sarah is the girl with the most total followers with a total of 180.
The answer is 180
Question: Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He
rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package.
He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. How much profit did he
make in total, in dollars?
A: Let’s think step by step
Sam bought 12 boxes x 10 = 120 worth of highlighters.
He bought 12 * 30 = 360 highlighters in total.
Sam then took 5 boxes × 6 highlighters/box = 30 highlighters.
He sold these boxes for 5 * $3 = $15
26

--- PAGE 27 ---
After selling these 5 boxes there were 360 - 30 = 330 highlighters remaining.
These form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.
He sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $220 from them.
In total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $235.
Since his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $115 in profit.
The answer is 115
Question: In a certain school, 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, but only 1/5 of the
female students like to play basketball. What percent of the population of the school do not like to
play basketball if the ratio of the male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students?
A: Let’s think step by step
The students are divided into 3 + 2 = 5 parts where 3 parts are for males and 2 parts are for females.
Each part represents 1000/5 = 200 students.
So, there are 3 x 200 = 600 males.
And there are 2 x 200 = 400 females.
Hence, 600 x 2/3 = 400 males play basketball.
And 400 x 1/5 = 80 females play basketball.
A total of 400 + 80 = 480 students play basketball.
Therefore, 1000 - 480 = 520 do not like to play basketball.
The percentage of the school that do not like to play basketball is 520/1000 * 100 = 52 The answer is 52

should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3
10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day? (Hint: The answer is near to 4).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 4. With the Answer Hints: 4, we will answer the question.
Let’s think step by step.
Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters
= 6 hours total.
For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6
hours total.
Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.
However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute
break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.
They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.
And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for
snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.
So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.
They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75
They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.
The answer is 4
Question: Mark’s basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws. Their
opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws. What’s the total number
of points scored by both teams added together?(Hint: The answer is near to 201).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 201. With the Answer Hints: 201, we will answer the question.
Let’s think step by step
Mark’s team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers.
His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers
They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free
throws.
All together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points
Mark’s opponents scored double his team’s number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100
points in 2 pointers.
His opponents scored half his team’s number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24/2= 12 points in 3

pointers.
They also scored half Mark’s team’s points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2=5 points in free
throws
All together Mark’s opponents scored 100+12+5=117 points
The total score for the game is both team’s scores added together, so it is 84+117=201 points
The answer is 201
Question: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck
cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will
have if she currently has 60 marbles? (Hint: The answer is near to 160,145).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 160, 145. With the Answer Hints: 160, 145, we will answer the
question.
Let’s think step by step
When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she’ll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 =
24
The total number of marbles she’ll have is 60+24 = 84
If Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 =
30 frisbees.
If Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she’ll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.
The total number of frisbees she’ll have will increase to 30+12 = 42
Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards
If she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she’ll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards.
The total number of deck cards she’ll have is 10+4 = 14
Together, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items
The answer is 140
Question: A group of 4 fruit baskets contains 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three
baskets and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket. How many fruits are there? (Hint: The answer is
near to 93, 141).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 93, 141. With the Answer Hints: 93, 141, we will answer the
question.
Let’s think step by step
For the first three baskets, the number of apples and oranges in one basket is 9+15=24
In total, together with bananas, the number of fruits in one basket is 24+14=38 for the first three
baskets.
Since there are three baskets each having 38 fruits, there are 3*38=114 fruits in the first three baskets.
The number of apples in the fourth basket is 9-2=7
There are also 15-2=13 oranges in the fourth basket
The combined number of oranges and apples in the fourth basket is 13+7=20
The fourth basket also contains 14-2=12 bananas.
In total, the fourth basket has 20+12=32 fruits.
The four baskets together have 32+114=146 fruits.
The answer is 146
Question: You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly
split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1
apple cost if your total bill was $66? (Hint: The answer is near to 1, 5).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 1, 5. With the Answer Hints: 1, 5, we will answer the question.
Let’s think step by step
If 36 fruits were evenly split between 3 types of fruits, then I bought 36/3 = 12 units of each fruit
If 1 orange costs $0.50 then 12 oranges will cost $0.50 * 12 = $6
If my total bill was $66 and I spent $6 on oranges then I spent $66 - $6 = $60 on the other 2 fruit
types.
Assuming the price of watermelon is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price
and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A
If we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for $60, then we know that $60 = 12W + 12A
Knowing that 1W=4A, then we can convert the above to $60 = 12(4A) + 12A
$60 = 48A + 12A
$60 = 60A

Then we know the price of one apple (A) is $60/60= $1
The answer is 1
Question: Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with
only 300 students. At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers. She gained
40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in
the third week. Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90
new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.
After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have?
(Hint: The answer is near to 180, 160).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 180, 160. With the Answer Hints: 180, 160, we will answer the
question.
Let’s think step by step
After one week, Susy has 100+40 = 140 followers.
In the second week, Susy gains 40/2 = 20 new followers.
In the third week, Susy gains 20/2 = 10 new followers.
In total, Susy finishes the three weeks with 140+20+10 = 170 total followers.
After one week, Sarah has 50+90 = 140 followers.
After the second week, Sarah gains 90/3 = 30 followers.
After the third week, Sarah gains 30/3 = 10 followers.
So, Sarah finishes the three weeks with 140+30+10 = 180 total followers.
Thus, Sarah is the girl with the most total followers with a total of 180.
The answer is 180
Question: Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He
rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package.
He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. How much profit did he
make in total, in dollars? (Hint: The answer is near to 120).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 120. With the Answer Hints: 120, we will answer the question.
Let’s think step by step
Sam bought 12 boxes x $10 = $120 worth of highlighters.
He bought 12 * 30 = 360 highlighters in total.
Sam then took 5 boxes × 6 highlighters/box = 30 highlighters.
He sold these boxes for 5 * $3 = $15
After selling these 5 boxes there were 360 - 30 = 330 highlighters remaining.
These form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.
He sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $220 from them.
In total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $235.
Since his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $115 in profit.
The answer is 115
Question: In a certain school, 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, but only 1/5 of the
female students like to play basketball. What percent of the population of the school do not like to
play basketball if the ratio of the male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students? (Hint:
The answer is near to 45).
A: We know the Answer Hints: 45. With the Answer Hints: 45, we will answer the question.
Let’s think step by step
The students are divided into 3 + 2 = 5 parts where 3 parts are for males and 2 parts are for females.
Each part represents 1000/5 = 200 students.
So, there are 3 x 200 = 600 males.
And there are 2 x 200 = 400 females.
Hence, 600 x 2/3 = 400 males play basketball.
And 400 x 1/5 = 80 females play basketball.
A total of 400 + 80 = 480 students play basketball.
Therefore, 1000 - 480 = 520 do not like to play basketball.
The percentage of the school that do not like to play basketball is 520/1000 * 100 = 52
The answer is 52

Question: there were 35 students in a hostel . due to the admission of 7 new students the expenses of
the mess were increased by rs . 84 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1
. what was the original expenditure of the mess ? Options: (a) rs 450 (b) rs 920 (c) rs 550 (d) rs . 630
(e) none of these
A: Let’s think step by step let the original average expenditure be rs . x then , 42 ( x - 1 ) - 35 x = 84 7
x = 126 x = 18 therefore original expenditure = rs . ( 35 * 18 ) = rs . 630. The answer is (d), rs . 630

Question: solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of
material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in
the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ?
Options: (a) 40 % (b) 60 % (c) 80 % (d) 100 % (e) 110 %
A: Let’s think step by step
we can assume the total weight of the mixture = 100
conc of a in the final mixture = 22
let weight of a in the mixture be x.
conc given = 20% = 0.2
therefore , weight of b = 100 - x.
conc given = 30% = 0.3
now , accordding to the problem, 0.2 x + 0.3 ( 100 - x ) = 22
solving , we get x = 80
since we assumed the weight of the mixture = 100, therefore presence of a in the mixture = 80%.
The answer is (c), 80%
Question: a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how

Options: (a) rs . 950 (b) rs . 1500 (c) rs . 1000 (d) rs . 1400 (e) none of these
A: Let’s think step by step
price of 1 metre cloth = 8200 / 40 = rs 205
cost of 1 metre cloth = rs 205 – 35 = rs 170
cost on 40 metres = 170 x 40 = rs . 6800
profit earned on 40 metres cloth = rs . 8200 – rs . 6800 = rs . 1400
The answer is (d), rs . 1400
Question: if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is
the least possible value s of z - x ?
Options: (a) 6 (b) 7 (c) 8 (d) 9 (e) 10
A: Let’s think step by step
We know x < y < z
to find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to
each other.
if x is some even number, then what could be minimum possible odd z.
if x is some even number, y - x > 5 ; y > x + 5
minimum value for y = x + 5 + 2 = x + 7
(note : x + 5 is as even + odd = odd and nearest odd greater than x + 5 is x + 5 + 2)
minimum value for z = y + 2 = x + 7 + 2 = x + 9
(note : z = y + 2 because both z and y are odd, difference between two odd numbers is 2)
s = z - x = x + 9 - x = 9
The answer is (d), 9
