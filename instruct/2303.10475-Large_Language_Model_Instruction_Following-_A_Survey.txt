Abstract
Task semantics can be expressed by a set of
input-output examples or a piece of textual in-
struction. Conventional machine learning ap-
proaches for natural language processing (NLP)
mainly rely on the availability of large-scale
sets of task-specific examples. Two issues arise:
first, collecting task-specific labeled examples
does not apply to scenarios where tasks may
be too complicated or costly to annotate, or
the system is required to handle a new task
immediately; second, this is not user-friendly
since end-users are probably more willing to
provide task description rather than a set of
examples before using the system. Therefore,
the community is paying increasing interest in
a new supervision-seeking paradigm for NLP:
learning to follow task instructions, i.e., instruc-
tion following . Despite its impressive progress,
there are some unsolved research equations that
the community struggles with. This survey pa-
per tries to summarize andprovide insights to
the current research on instruction following,
particularly, by answering the following ques-
tions: (i) What is task instruction, and what in-
struction types exist? (ii) How to model instruc-
tions? (iii) What are popular instruction follow-
ing datasets and evaluation metrics? (iv) What
factors influence and explain the instructions’
performance? (v) What challenges remain in
instruction following? To our knowledge, this
is the first comprehensive survey about instruc-
tion following.1
1 Introduction
One goal of AI is to build a system that can uni-
versally understand and solve new tasks. Labeled
examples (Figure 1 (a)), as the mainstream task
representation, are costly to obtain at scale or even
do not exist in some cases. Then, is there any
other task representation that can contribute to task

comprehension? Textual instructions provide an-
other dimension of supervision for expressing the
task semantics, which often contains more abstract
and comprehensive knowledge of the target task
than individual labeled examples. As shown in
Figure 1 (b), with the availability of task instruc-
tions, systems can be quickly built to handle new
tasks. Such efficiency is highly desirable in real-
world applications, especially when task-specific
annotations are scarce. More importantly, instruc-
tion following leans toward human intelligence in
terms of learning new tasks—a little child can well
solve a new mathematical task by learning from
its instruction and a few examples (Fennema et al.,
1996; Carpenter et al., 1996). As a result, this new
learning paradigm has recently attracted the main
attention of the machine learning and NLP commu-
nities (Wang et al., 2022b; Longpre et al., 2023).
When talking about “instruction”, most of usarXiv:2303.10475v8  [cs.CL]  25 May 2024

will first think of “prompt”—using a brief template
to convert a task input into a new format (e.g., cloze
question) that caters to the language modeling ob-
jective of large language models (LLMs) (Brown
et al., 2020). Despite the prevalence of prompts
in text classification, machine translation, etc., we
argue that prompts are merely a special case of in-
structions. This paper takes a comprehensive and
broader view of instruction-driven NLP research.
Particularly, we try to answer the following ques-
tions: (i) what is task instruction, and what instruc-
tion types exist? (§ 4) (ii) given a task instruction,
how to encode it to assist the model generaliza-
tion on the target task? (§ 5) (iii) what are popular
instruction following datasets and the mainstream
evaluation metrics? (§ 6) (iv) what factors (e.g.,
model size, task numbers) impact the instruction-
driven systems’ performance? (§ 7) (v) what chal-
lenges exist in instruction following, and what are
future directions? (§ 8)
To our knowledge, this is the first paper that
surveys the instruction following. In contrast to
some existing surveys that focused on a specific in-
context instruction, such as prompts (Liu et al.,
2023a), input-by-output demonstrations (Dong
et al., 2023), or reasoning (Huang and Chang, 2023;
Qiao et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023a), this work pro-
vides a more comprehensive overview of the in-
struction following. Our contributions are three-
fold:
•Going beyond prompts, we analyze prompt
constraints via a user-centric lens, with a focus on
discerning the disparity between current instruction
following research and real-world needs.
•Weinterpret different task instructions from
the unified perspective of indirect supervision , and
summarize their advantages, limitations, and scope
of applications;
•We regard current ever-growing LLMs and in-
struction datasets as an effort of dual-track scaling;
additionally, we point out current notable research
issues and promising directions in the future.
2 Related Work
There are basically two topics that highly relate to
this paper, namely instruction following (2.1) and
Surveys on In-context Instructions (2.2).
2.1 Instruction Following
As illustrated in Figure 1, unlike traditional
example-driven supervised learning, the essenceof instruction following is to train the LLMs to un-
derstand various instructions and produce the cor-
responding responses. Since this capacity can be
extended to any unseen downstream tasks, instruc-
tion following has become an efficient learning
paradigm for solving few/zero-shot tasks (Radford
et al., 2019; Schick and Schütze, 2021c; Yin et al.,
2022; Li et al., 2023a; Gupta et al., 2023; Sun et al.,
2024; Xie et al., 2024b, inter alia ). However, the
performance of instruction following highly relies
on both model and task scale: a larger LLM (or pre-
training with more tokens) tuned on more diverse
tasks can achieve significantly better few/zero-shot
performances on the downstream tasks (Chung
et al., 2022; Iyer et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023c,
inter alia ). As scaling model size is unrealistic
for most of us, numerous recent studies worked on
collecting high-quality instruction-tuning datasets,
either employing human labors (Khashabi et al.,
2020; Ye et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al.,
2022b; Longpre et al., 2023; Conover et al., 2023;
Köpf et al., 2023) or distilling supervision from
the powerful LLMs (Wang et al., 2023d; Honovich
et al., 2023a; Taori et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023;
Xu et al., 2023b; Geng et al., 2023; Chiang et al.,
2023; Xu et al., 2023a; Köksal et al., 2023; Kim
et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2023; Lou
et al., 2024), e.g., utilizing ChatGPT or GPT-4 to
develop creative task instructions (OpenAI, 2022,
2023).
Despite the popularity, the current instruction fol-
lowing still suffers challenges and has considerable
room for evolution. This work not only surveys the
extensive existing literature on instruction follow-
ing but also goes beyond: we trace the development
of instruction following back to the early days of
semantic parsing based machine learning, and for-
mulate our story from an indirect supervision per-
spective. We hope this survey can systematically
introduce this popular yet challenging area.
2.2 Surveys on In-context Instructions
Several existing surveys (Dong et al., 2023; Huang
and Chang, 2023; Qiao et al., 2023; Yu et al.,
2023a) share similar motivations with us while fo-
cusing on merely some sub-area of instruction fol-
lowing, such as prompt, few-shot demonstrations,
chain-of-thoughts reasoning, etc. For example, Liu
et al. (2023a) provided a comprehensive overview
of prompt learning and LLMs, where the prompt
can be regarded as one specific type of textual in-

struction (as categorized in § 4). Some other stud-
ies surveying “soft instruction”, namely parameter-
efficient fine-tuning methods (Lialin et al., 2023),
also differ from our scope of “textual instruction”.
Notably, Zhang et al. (2023b) also proposed a sur-
vey on instruction tuning, however, they mostly
focused on the existing datasets and models; while
we present a more complete and consistent story of
the instruction following, including the instruction
categories, modeling strategies and so on, which
previous works have never introduced. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides
a comprehensive and high-level story of instruction
following.
3 Preliminary
For instruction following, we target driving the sys-
tems to reach the corresponding output of the input
by following the instruction. Thus, we assume that
a dataset usually consists of three items:
•Input (X): the input of an instance; it can be a
single piece of text (e.g., sentiment classification)
or a group of text pieces (e.g., textual entailment,
question answering, etc.).
•Output (Y): the output of an instance; in clas-
sification problems, it can be one or multiple prede-
fined labels; in text generation tasks, it can be any
open-form text.
•Template (T): a textual template that either
tries to express task intent or is used for bridging
X and Y.2T may not be an instruction yet.
In § 4, we will elaborate that a task instruction I

T on its own in some cases.
4 What is Task Instruction?—A Unified
Perspective from Indirect Supervision
This section first summarizes three main instruc-
tion types constructed by different combinations
ofT,X, and Y(as illustrated in Figure 2), then
presents our interpretation of them via an indirect
supervision perspective.
4.1 Three Types of Instructions
4.1.1 NLI-oriented Instructions (i.e., I=T+Y)
A conventional scheme to handle the classification
tasks is to convert the target labels into indices and
let models decide which indices the inputs belong
to. This paradigm only encodes the input semantics
while losing the label semantics. To let systems
recognize new labels without relying on massive
labeled examples, Yin et al. (2019) proposed con-
verting the target classification tasks into natural
language inference (NLI) by building a hypothesis
for each label—deriving the truth value of a label
is then converted into determining the truth value
of the hypothesis. As exemplified in Figure 2 (a),
this approach builds instructions ( I) by combining
a template ( T) with a label ( Y) to explain the task
semantics. Table 1 further provides more detailed
examples for NLI-oriented Instructions .
The advantages of NLI-oriented Instructions
learning are four-fold: (i) it keeps the label se-
mantics and makes it possible to encode the input-
output relations; (ii) it unifies various classification
problems into an NLI task; (iii) by making use of

classification tasks, the intermediate answers may require further mapping (i.e., verbalizer).
the indirect supervision from existing NLI datasets,
a model trained on NLI tasks is expected to work
on other tasks in a zero-shot manner; (iv) it extends
the original close-set indices classification problem
into an open-domain label recognition paradigm.
Therefore, it has been widely used in a variety of
few/zero-shot classification tasks (Xu et al., 2023d),
such as classifying topics (Yin et al., 2019), sen-
timents (Zhong et al., 2021), stances (Xu et al.,
2022b), entity types (Li et al., 2022a), entity rela-
tions (Murty et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2021; Sainz
et al., 2021, 2022), etc.
4.1.2 LLM-oriented Instructions (i.e.,
prompts; I=T+X)
As shown in Figure 2 (b) and Table 2, the prompt is
a representative of the LLM-oriented Instructions ,
which is usually a brief utterance prepended with
the task input (prefix prompt), or a cloze-question
template (cloze prompt). It is basically designed
for querying the intermedia responses (that can
be further converted into the final outputs) fromthe LLM. Since the prompted input conforms to
the pre-training objectives of LLM (e.g., the cloze-
style input satisfies the masked language modeling
objective (Devlin et al., 2019a)), it helps get rid
of the reliance on the traditional supervised fine-
tuning and greatly alleviates the cost of human
annotations. Thus, prompt learning achieved im-
pressive results on a multitude of previous few/zero-
shot NLP tasks, like question answering (Radford
et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022), machine transla-
tion (Li et al., 2022c), sentiment analysis (Wu and
Shi, 2022), textual entailment (Schick and Schütze,
2021a,b), entity recognition (Cui et al., 2021; Wang
et al., 2022a), etc.
Despite the excellent performance of prompt
techniques, there are still two obvious shortcom-
ings with LLM-oriented Instructions in real-world
applications. (i) Not User-Friendly . As the prompt
is crafted for serving LLMs, it is encouraged to
design the prompt in a “model’s language” (e.g.,
model-preferred incoherent words or internal em-
bedding). However, this LLM-oriented style is

hard to be understood by users and often violates
human intuitions (Gao et al., 2021; Li and Liang,
2021; Qin and Eisner, 2021; Khashabi et al., 2022).
Meanwhile, the performance of prompts highly de-
pends on the laborious prompt engineering (Bach
et al., 2022), but most end-users are not LLM
experts and usually lack sufficient knowledge to
tune an effective prompt. (ii) Applications Con-
straints . The prompt is usually short and simplistic,
whereas many tasks cannot be effectively formu-
lated with solely a brief prompt, making prompt
hard to deal with the diverse formats of real-world
NLP tasks (Chen et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2023a).
4.1.3 Human-oriented Instructions (i.e., I=T+
optional {Xi,Yi}k
i=1)
Human-oriented Instructions essentially denotes
the instructions used for crowd-sourcing on
the human-annotation platforms (e.g., Amazon
MTurk). Unlike LLM-oriented Instructions ,
Human-oriented Instructions (Figure 2 (c)) are
usually some human-readable, descriptive, and
paragraph-style information consisting of various
components, such as “ task title ”, “category ”,
“definition ”, and “ things to avoid ”, etc. (cf.
Mishra et al., 2022b) Thus, Human-oriented In-
structions are more user-friendly and can be ideally
applied to almost any complex NLP task. Table 3
further shows some representative task examples.
Accordingly, Human-oriented Instructions have
attracted much more attention in recent years (Hu
et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2022,
inter alia ). However, due to the complex nature,
Human-oriented Instructions are more challeng-ing to encode by vanilla LLMs. For example,
off-the-shelf GPT-2 was found to work poorly on
following MTurk instructions (Wolf et al., 2019;
Efrat and Levy, 2020). To tame the LLMs bet-
ter understand the Human-oriented Instructions ,
follow-up works began to collect large-scale in-
struction datasets (Mishra et al., 2022b; Wang et al.,
2022b). All the previous results showed that, af-
ter fine-tuning with various task instructions, the
text-to-text LLMs, like T5 (Raffel et al., 2020),
OPT (Zhang et al., 2022a) and Llama (Touvron
et al., 2023), achieved remarkable few/zero-shot
generalizations by following these complex instruc-
tions (Wang et al., 2023c; Ivison et al., 2023b).
4.2 An Indirect Supervision Perspective
Although the three types of instructions are very
different from each other, they are essentially seek-
ing the same thing— indirect supervision —to cope
with target tasks that have limited annotations.
Specifically, NLI-oriented Instructions trans-
form target NLP problems into a source task—
NLI—so that the rich supervision from existing
NLI datasets can act as indirect supervision for
those target problems. LLM-oriented Instruc-
tions reformat target problems into the source
task—language modeling, so that the rich generic-
purpose knowledge in those LLMs can be directly
utilized to get the output. Whether it is NLI-
oriented Instructions orLLM-oriented Instructions ,
both try to solve unseen tasks with a generaliz-
able system. However, both of them have lim-
ited application scope, e.g., they cannot efficiently
deal with some structured prediction tasks (Chen

et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2023a). Instead of seek-
ing supervision from a single source task (NLI
or language modeling), Human-oriented Instruc-
tions learn indirect supervision from a large set
of training tasks, the resulting system, therefore,
can ideally generalize to any unseen textual tasks.
Table 4 further compares them from different di-
mensions.
5 How to Model Instructions?
Since both NLI-oriented Instructions andLLM-
oriented Instructions are associated with either
the input Xor the output Y, these types of in-
structions do not require specific system design
to encode them. NLI-oriented Instructions can be
handled by regular systems for the NLI task, and
LLM-oriented Instructions are mostly fed to auto-
regressive LLMs. In contrast, Human-oriented In-
structions are the most challenging type since it is
independent of any labeled instances.
Therefore, this section mainly presents several
mainstream modeling strategies for the Human-
oriented Instructions , as illustrated in Figure 3.
5.1 Semantic Parser
At the early stage of machine learning, to help the
systems understand natural language instructions, a
great number of works employed semantic parsing
to convert the instruction into the formal language
(logical formula), which can be more easily exe-
cuted by the systems (Goldwasser and Roth, 2011,
inter alia ). As exemplified in Figure 3 (a), a game
instruction “ Move any top card to an empty
free cell ” can be processed into an executable
formula: “ card(x) ∧freecell(y) ”.
Previous research spent extensive efforts on this
strategy, among which most are used for human-
computer interaction tasks, e.g., playing soccer
games (Kuhlmann et al., 2004). To alleviate la-
borious human annotations, the follow-up works

leveraged indirect or weak supervision from the
grounded environments (e.g., knowledge base) to
train the semantic parser (Kim and Mooney, 2012).
Limitations Semantic parser-based approaches
mainly apply to individual tasks rather than uni-
versal cross-task generalization, because building a
versatile semantic parser for all NLP tasks is over
challenging. By contrast, the approach introduced
in the next subsection aims at cross-task generaliza-
tion with limited supervision for the target tasks.
5.2 Flatten-and-Concatenation
In contrast to the semantic parser approach, which
considers the instructions’ structure and the target
problems, methods based on the neural networks
take more brutal treatment: as illustrated in Fig-
ure 3 (b)—instructions, regardless of their length,
structure, task types, etc., are flattened as a long

--- PAGE 7 ---
token sequence and concatenated with the input X
as a new input sequence for the models, which has
been widely adopted by the prior research (Wang
et al., 2022b; Wei et al., 2023, inter alia ). How-
ever, this naive strategy constantly results in un-
satisfactory performances when using vanilla mod-
els (Weller et al., 2020), leading to its reliance on
large-scale instruction fine-tuning, well-known as
“instruction tuning”.
Limitations (i) Flattening and concatenating ev-
erything into a long sequence tends to ignore some
key information that humans can often capture in
the instruction (Mishra et al., 2022a; Jang et al.,
2022), such as negation (e.g., “ do not generate
outputs longer than 5 tokens ”), warning
(e.g., “ generate ‘D’ if the question is
not answerable or you’re not sure ”),
output constraints (e.g., “ your answer should
be in one of ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’ ”),
and so on. (ii) To let models understand the
instruction, a large number of training tasks have
to be prepared. This is similar to what happened in
the early years of deep learning in NLP: to improve
the performance of deep neural networks for a
particular task, we collect more labeled examples;
back to the instruction following, the system’s
comprehension of the instruction, unfortunately,
still exhibits a high degree of dependence on the
scale of training tasks (Chung et al., 2022).
5.3 HyperNetwork
Unlike the conventional modeling strategy that en-
codes the input sequence into the dense represen-
tation (i.e., language-to-representation), hypernet-
work follows a language-to-parameter paradigm:
as shown in Figure 3 (c), this scheme converts tex-
tual instruction into a block of model parameters
that can be further plugged into the underlying mod-
els (Ha et al., 2017; Houlsby et al., 2019; Jin et al.,
2020). As a result, hypernetwork-based instruction
modeling can better leverage the structured input
sequence by encoding the instruction and task input
separately (i.e., instruction-to-parameter, input-to-
representation), achieving stronger generalization
compared with the flatten-and-concatenation ap-
proach (Ye and Ren, 2021; Deb et al., 2022). It can
also significantly improve inference efficiency, as
concluded by recent works (Ivison et al., 2023a).
Limitations Despite the attractive attributes of
hypernetwork, its training instability and the re-
liance on architecture design (suiting the underly-ing models) are the stumbling blocks in real-world
applications (Brock et al., 2018; Ortiz et al., 2023).
5.4 Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback
The loss function for training LMs significantly
impacts the resulting LMs’ instruction-following
performance (Tay et al., 2023). However, almost
all the aforementioned modeling strategies (except
the semantic-parser-based method) adopt a con-
ventional next token prediction loss (e.g. cross
entropy) to train the models, which tries to cap-
ture the human preference by simply comparing
the model’s generation text with the ground truth
reference. In order to directly optimize the LMs
with the supervision of human preference, recent
works utilized reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) to train the LMs (Stiennon et al.,
2020; Bai et al., 2022a; Ouyang et al., 2022).
Initial and tuned LM The first step of RLHF is
to obtain an initial LM, which is usually trained
with the flatten-and-concatenation-based modeling
strategy — concatenate instruction, input and all
other resources (if they exist) into one input se-
quence, and train the LM to generate the ground-
truth output (as we have introduced before). With
the initial LM as a starting point, we can copy it
to another independent parameter, which is the tar-
get LM will be continually updated in RLHF (i.e.,
tuned LM).
Prediction shift penalty As shown in Fig-
ure 3 (d), given the initial LM and its copy (the
target tuned LM), for each input sequence (e.g.,
instruction and task input), these two different LMs
will generate two outputs. After getting the gen-
eration texts of the initial and tuned LM, we can
further calculate the textual difference penalty be-
tween them:
y=θ(I, x)
y∗=θ∗(I, x)
rKL=KL(y, y∗)
Here, the θandθ∗represent the parameters of
initial and tuned LM, respectively. Iandxdenote
the instruction and task input; While yandy∗are
the outputs of the initial and tuned LM. rKLis the fi-
nal reward (loss) of prediction shifting, and the KL
means the calculation of Kullback–Leibler (KL) di-
vergence. KL divergence is a widely adopted strat-

--- PAGE 8 ---
egy for measuring the textual difference, which can
be used as a part of the loss to penalize the tuned
LM on shifting the output substantially away from
the initial LM’s generation. This prediction shift
penalty can prevent the tuned LM from fooling the
reward function to get a high reward but loses the
coherence of the generation text.
Reward function Besides the prediction shift
penalty, another part of the final reward comes
from the reward function. A reward function is
used for directly measuring how well the model’s
output aligns with human preference — the higher
rewards mean the output better aligns with human
preference.
A reward function is another model tuned on
human preference data, which is usually smaller
than the initial LM. It receives the instruction, task
input and models’ outputs, and tries to predict a
reward scalar to reflect the alignment:
ralignment =rθ(I, x, y∗)
Therθis the reward model, which is usually a
regression model.
For training a reward model, previous works
collected a bunch of human preference data. For
example, Bai et al. (2022a) collected different out-
puts for each input instruction, and asked human
annotators to decide which output more aligned
with their preference. The training loss of reward
model can be formulated as follows:
l=−log 
σ 
rθ 
I, x, y+
−rθ 
I, x, y−
Where the σis the activation function that scales
the reward into (0,1],y+is the output preferred
by human, y−otherwise. By training on these
pairwise preference comparison data, the reward
model can directly learn to capture the human pref-
erence and make alignment reward estimation for
the RLHF.
The final training reward and inference To this
end, the final reward for RL update rule is:
r=ralignment −λrKL
Theλhere is the controlling factor.
After training with the above RL policy, the final
tuned LM can better align with human preference.
While the inference procedure of the tuned LM isactually similar to the aforementioned flatten-and-
concatenation modeling, where it receives instruc-
tion and input, and then generates the correspond-
ing output.
Limitations Compared with other modeling
strategies, RLHF requires much more expensive
human efforts because of collecting the preference
data, especially when the preference comparison
outputs are all written by humans (Ouyang et al.,
2022). Meanwhile, the performance of RLHF
highly relies on the quality of its human prefer-
ence annotations. More importantly, in some cases,
such as some open-ended creative writing tasks, dif-
ferent humans often hold high disagreement on the
preference decision due to the lack of ground-truth
output.
6 Instruction Following Dataset and
Evaluation
In this section, we shed light on an important
topic related to the instruction following, i.e., the
instruction-following datasets and the evaluation
settings for the instruction-tuned models.
6.1 Dataset
The essence of instruction following is to tame
the models by following various task instruc-
tions and responding with the corresponding de-
sired outputs. Therefore, the instruction-tuning
dataset (high-quality instruction-output pairs) is
the critical part (Wang et al., 2023c; Zhou et al.,
2023a). The current instruction-tuning datasets
can be divided into two categories according
to different annotation categories: 1) human-
annotated datasets (§ 6.1.1); 2) LLM-synthetic
datasets (§ 6.1.2).
We summarize the existing instruction-following
datasets in Table 6 of Appendix A for a better
overview.
6.1.1 Human-annotated datasets
The conventional way to create instruction-tuning
datasets is by employing human annotators, es-
pecially for those early-stage datasets, as shown
in Table 6. For example, PUBLIC POOL OF
PROMPTS (P3) (Sanh et al., 2022) and FLAN
(Wei et al., 2022a) collected multi-task instruction-
tuning datasets, where they employed human exper-
tise to design various prompts for each task. Mishra
et al. (2022b) proposed NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS ,
in which they collected more than 60 NLP tasks

--- PAGE 9 ---
with the corresponding human-written instructions;
Wang et al. (2022b) further extended this collection
into a 1.6k cross-lingual tasks scale contributed
by 88 NLP experts, namely SUPER -NATURAL IN-
STRUCTIONS .
Human-created datasets are mostly high-quality
(with minimum annotation errors) but require labo-
rious human efforts and expensive time consump-
tion. More importantly, humans suffer from limited
diversity — it’s really challenging for humans to
brainstorm diverse and novel tasks; thus, the task
scale of human-annotated datasets is usually lim-
ited by human annotators (e.g., expertise level and
collaboration scheme of humans).
6.1.2 LLM-synthetic datasets
Since LLMs have shown their superior annotation
quality on various NLP tasks (He et al., 2023;
Pan et al., 2023), tons of recent works tried to
employ LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4) in-
stead of humans on instruction-tuning dataset cura-
tion. For instance, SELF-INSTURCT (Wang et al.,
2023d) and UNNATURAL INSTRUCTIONS (Hon-
ovich et al., 2023a) utilized human-annotated in-
structions as demonstrations to guide LLMs in de-
vising novel tasks and increasing task diversity.
WIZARD LM (Xu et al., 2023a) employed an in-
struction evolution paradigm to increase instruction
complexity. DYNOSAUR (Yin et al., 2023) repur-
posed existing input-output pairs in NLP datasets
to stimulate new instructions and reduce annota-
tion costs. MUFFIN (Lou et al., 2024) prompted
the LLMs to gather different task instructions for
the same input and obtained an impressive general-
ization capacity of the tuned smaller models. Be-
sides single-turn instruction-output datasets, some
works also collected multi-turn dialogue data from
ShareGPT3, where the instructions are created by
humans (users of OpenAI API), and the responses
are from LLMs (Geng et al., 2023; Chiang et al.,
2023).
Though these LLM-synthetic datasets contained
considerable noise (e.g., incoherent instructions
and hallucination outputs), the diverse task distribu-
tion and model-preferred output patterns still ben-
efit the smaller models on instruction-following,
achieving comparable even better generalization
performance compared with human-annotated
datasets (Wang et al., 2023d,c).
In a word, the choice between human-annotated
3https://sharegpt.com/and LLM-synthetic datasets can also be regarded as
a trade-off between data quality and diversity. Pre-
vious works have concluded that both factors affect
the performance of the resulting models (Chung
et al., 2022; Longpre et al., 2023) — mixing human
and machine data can lead to better results (Wang
et al., 2023d; Yin et al., 2023), while there is no
concrete conclusion about which factor outweighs
the other, which highly depends on the downstream
tasks and application situations.
6.2 Evaluation
6.2.1 Different evaluation schemes
How to evaluate an instruction-tuned model is also
a crucial topic. Most traditional NLP tasks usually
have concrete criteria on the task objective, while
for instruction following, the key objective is to
tame the model to follow instructions — how well
the model follows instructions is highly subjective
and depends on various preferences. Therefore,
different works tend to utilize various evaluation
strategies. In this section, we list several common
evaluation settings.
Automatic metrics When testing the model’s
instruction-following performance on an evalu-
ation dataset, if this dataset has “ground-truth”
outputs, then a conventional criterion is to use
those automatic evaluation metrics, such as EXACT -
MATCH (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and ROUGE (Lin,
2004), that have been widely used for evaluating
the generation models (Mishra et al., 2022b; Wang
et al., 2022b; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022;
Lou and Yin, 2023; Yin et al., 2022). However,
this naive evaluation strategy suffers from several
drawbacks: 1) it has been widely committed that
the automatic generation metrics are not perfect
and have significant biases (e.g., BLUE score has
text length bias); 2) all of these metrics are used
for showing how well the model’s prediction aligns
with pre-annotated answers, however, most real-
world user tasks are highly open-ended, and there
are probably no official ground-truth labels to cal-
culate the metrics; 3) the essence of instruction
following is to follow user’s instructions and pro-
vide desired responses that can well address user’s
requirements, while automatic metrics more focus
on some superficial textual patterns and lacking the
reflection on how well the response satisfies the
instructions.

--- PAGE 10 ---
Human evaluation A more reliable evaluation
method is to employ humans to decide whether a
model’s response satisfies the instruction or not.
For example, given a task instruction and a cor-
responding model output, the human evaluator
should read the instruction and decide whether this
model output is acceptable or not (reporting an ac-
ceptance ratio for the target model) (Wang et al.,
2023d,c; Lou et al., 2024); or ask humans to com-
pare two models’ outputs and decide which one
better satisfies the instruction (pairwise compar-
ison between two models) (Chiang et al., 2023;
Geng et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023). Since instruc-
tions are mostly complicated and contain a lot of
explicit or implicit constraints, human evaluation is
more flexible and accurate than automatic metrics
in reflecting the instruction-following capacities of
different models.
However, human evaluation is also much more
expensive, slower than automatic evaluation, and
unreproducible. Thus, most of the works only con-
duct human evaluation on a small subset of the
whole evaluation benchmark. Meanwhile, it is
mostly based on human evaluators’ personal pref-
erences and can result in high variance between
different evaluators.
Leading LLMs as evaluators To address the
aforementioned issues of human evaluation, recent
works also tried to use LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) rather
than humans to evaluate the models’ instruction fol-
lowing capacity, such as VicunaEval (Chiang et al.,
2023) and AlpacaEval (Taori et al., 2023). Nev-
ertheless, although LLMs are cheaper and faster,
they were found to have serious preference bias on
some superficial textual patterns or hallucinations,
e.g., GPT-4 prefers the longer texts and those re-
sponses with diverse tokens (Wang et al., 2023c).
Meanwhile, only a final preference score is usually
insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation.
In order to improve reliability, instead of letting
LLMs simply provide a preference decision, other
works tend to ask LLMs to generate comprehensive
analyses besides the final decision, such as gener-
ating the error types, locations and explanations
before concluding with the final scores (Fernandes
et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023e). Some other works
also predefined several explainable criterion ques-
tions for the various evaluation tasks (e.g., for an
instruction “ Please generate at least 25 sentences ”,
define a criterion “ is the model’s generation at least
25 sentences? ”), that can be further verified by hu-mans or LLMs easily (i.e., doing binary classifica-
tion on these predefined criteria) (Liu et al., 2023e;
Zhou et al., 2023b). Saha et al. (2023) also asked
LLMs to first generate the criteria questions au-
tomatically according to the instructions and then
evaluate the model’s response.
6.2.2 Two branches of evaluation
Despite the various evaluation choices in the in-
struction following, they can be summarized into
two branches from our view.
Task-centric evaluation Most evaluation
datasets in this branch are based on conventional
multi-task learning, where the evaluation tasks
are mostly traditional NLP tasks, such as natural
language inference (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al.,
2022). This branch aims to test LLMs’ instruction-
following and problem-solving capacity, and the
main criterion here is whether the models can
correctly solve the given textual task. Therefore,
most of the evaluation settings in this branch adopt
conventional automatic metrics to reflect the task
ground-truth label alignment. Representative
benchmarks are MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021),
BBH (Suzgun et al., 2023), SuperNI-Test (Wang
et al., 2022b), T0-Eval (Sanh et al., 2022),
InstructEval (Chia et al., 2023), etc.
Human-centric evaluation The evaluation in-
structions in this setting are user-oriented or
dialogue-like user queries, mainly used to test how
well the models’ responses align with human pref-
erence, especially for the safety and usefulness
of the responses (e.g., harmlessness and honesty).
Unlike the task-centric evaluation, human-centric
evaluation cares less about the ground-truth labels
since most user tasks are open-ended. Thus, this
evaluation setting is more subjective and requires
more high-level human or LLM efforts. Represen-
tative benchmarks are AlpacaFarm (Dubois et al.,
2023), VicunaEval (Chiang et al., 2023), HHH (Bai
et al., 2022b), etc.
To our knowledge, since instruction following
is a pretty wide topic that can be related to various
downstream tasks and real-world scenarios, there
is still a lack of a comprehensive evaluation setting
that can be applied to all of the target scenarios. A
more practical choice is to adopt different evalua-
tion settings according to the objectives of different
works (i.e., task-centric or human-centric).

7 Factors that Influence Instruction
Following Performance
Instruction following is proven to be effective in
a lot of few/zero-shot NLP tasks, but how to ex-
plain the impressive performance of instruction?
And which aspects make a successful instruction
following procedure? We categorize the factors
affecting instruction following performance into
five dimensions: model ,instruction ,demonstration ,
model-instruction interaction , and dataset . Table 5
displays a roadmap for this section, where we also
conclude the takeaways to make it easy to refer to.
7.1 Model-related Factors
7.1.1 Update model or not
As shown in Figure 1 (b), to drive LLMs to under-
stand and follow task instructions more smoothly,
a widely-adopted practice is fine-tuning LLMs
on multi-task datasets, where each task input is
equipped with a task instruction. This procedure isalso well-known as “instruction tuning”. A lot of
works demonstrated that instruction-tuned LLMs
could better follow the instructions of unseen tasks
compared with frozen LLMs (Wei et al., 2022a;
Sanh et al., 2022).
Besides the performance gains on unseen tasks,
instruction tuning has many other benefits, such as
learning faster on the downstream tasks (Longpre
et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2023), being more robust
to the tiny instruction perturbations (e.g., paraphras-
ing) (Weller et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2022; Gu et al.,
2023), becoming more user-friendly (Chung et al.,
2022), and being better at following soft instruc-
tions (Wei et al., 2022a), etc.
7.1.2 Model scale
Recent works demonstrated that the model scale
significantly impacts the generalization perfor-
mance of instruction following (Chung et al., 2022;
Longpre et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c, inter
alia). As shown in Figure 4, the generalization
performances of each model consistently increase
when scaling up the model size. More interestingly,
when the model scale is large enough, even vanilla
LLMs can significantly outperform smaller LLMs
tuned on extensive tasks (see Flan-PaLM; vanilla
540B >8B + 1836 tasks), which probably implies
that the benefits of scaling up the model size can
outweigh dataset scaling.
However, the super-large model scale is usually
unaffordable for most research groups, and it also
leads to huge carbon emissions, making it unreal-
istic in most real-world scenarios (Strubell et al.,
2019; Schick and Schütze, 2021c). Accordingly,
recent works began to investigate a more efficient
way to address the model scale problem, e.g., the
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2022a;
Liu et al., 2022a; Lialin et al., 2023; Jang et al.,
2023).
7.2 Instruction-related Factors
7.2.1 Instruction engineering
A common problem in instruction following is that
the pre-trained models are usually sensitive to some
subtle modifications in the instruction (Weller et al.,
2020; Efrat and Levy, 2020; Bach et al., 2022;
Mishra et al., 2022a; Gu et al., 2023) — even a
minor edition on instruction, such as paraphrasing
or word replacement, can lead to huge performance
variance. Therefore, modifying the wording of in-
struction before usage, namely instruction engineer-
ing, is critical for the models’ performance.

--- PAGE 12 ---
(a) Flan-T5(b) Flan-PaLMFigure 4: The scaling trends of instruction following, including scaling model size and task numbers. We report
the cross-task generalization performances of two widely-adopted instruction-tuned LLMs, namely Flan-T5 and
Flan-PaLM (Chung et al., 2022), where the source scores mainly come from (Wei et al., 2022a; Chung et al., 2022;
Longpre et al., 2023). It is worth noting that different papers may utilize distinct evaluation benchmarks with
various metrics. To clearly summarize the scaling trends, instead of simply copying the original scores, we report
thenormalized performances in each figure (that’s why the highest performance of each figure can reach 100%).
One straightforward solution is to manually
rewrite the instruction, i.e., human instruction en-
gineering. When humans perform instruction engi-
neering, the criteria of rewriting are mostly human
intuition. For example, Mishra et al. (2022a) con-
ducted error cases analysis on GPT’s instruction-
following outputs. Accordingly, they designed sev-
eral empirical rules on instruction writing and “re-
framed” the instructions. All of these proposed
rules are based on human intuition, e.g., itemiz-
ing instructions and task decomposition. In or-
der to avoid the preference bias introduced by a
small group of humans, Bach et al. (2022) pro-
posed community-driven instruction engineering,
where they collected instructions created by various
NLP experts with different writing styles, diversi-
fying the choices of instructions. However, human
instruction engineering is time-consuming and ex-
pensive. Moreover, the human intuition on instruc-
tion designing might be subjective and sometimes
sub-optimal for the models.
To this end, automatic instruction engineering
tries to let the model figure out the better instruc-
tions automatically. Prasad et al. (2023) proposed
an edition-based method to automatically modify
the instruction. For each iteration, they edited the
instruction in phrase level to generate multiple can-didates, and then employed the target model to pre-
dict the scores of the different candidates by using
a small labeled set (i.e., calculating the ground-
truth entropy and accuracy). In doing this, Prasad
et al. (2023) achieved better performance compared
with those manually-reframed instructions (Mishra
et al., 2022a). Besides using the ground-truth score,
Gonen et al. (2023) utilized the model’s prediction
likelihood as feedback to select instruction can-
didates, which even doesn’t require any labeled
instances. Deng et al. (2022) further proposed a re-
inforcement learning framework to conduct instruc-
tion engineering. Despite the superior performance,
the obvious drawback of automatic instruction en-
gineering is the poor explainability, where the re-
sulting instructions mostly violate human intuition
(e.g., some task-irrelevant sentences) (Khashabi
et al., 2022; Prasad et al., 2023), which is similar
to the soft instruction.
In a word, instruction engineering is a trade-off
procedure — lower explainability is the tax of bet-
ter performances. Meanwhile, instruction engineer-
ing is a highly empirical subject, and there are
no gold-standard rules/methods on it — different
models and tasks might require totally different in-
struction designing. Hence, we highly recommend
the community release the accompanying instruc-

--- PAGE 13 ---
tion manuals when releasing their instruction-tuned
models, thus ensuring stable and expected model
behaviours (e.g., OpenAI’s cooking book4).
7.2.2 Instruction consistency
This factor considers the instructions across the
training tasks and test tasks . Keeping the instruc-
tion paradigm (e.g., abstractiveness) consistent is
crucial in instruction following. Wei et al. (2022a)
first investigated the performance impact of chang-
ing the instruction paradigm. They found that
LLMs tuned on short instructions (i.e., task names)
cannot generalize to longer sentence-style instruc-
tions ( short ̸⇒long ). Similarly, Gu et al. (2023)
observed the performance dropping when chang-
ing paragraph-style instructions to shorter sentence-
style instructions at the test phase ( long̸⇒short ),
further indicating the importance of instruction con-
sistency.
Besides discrete instruction, maintaining the in-
struction paradigm is also critical for soft instruc-
tion, i.e., keeping the same-size prefix embedding
when testing on unseen tasks (Xu et al., 2022a).
Interestingly, similar results were also found in the
few-shot demonstrations (i.e., in-context learning),
where the combination of input-output pairs or the
number of demonstrations cannot be changed dur-
ing training and evaluation (Min et al., 2022a,b;
Iyer et al., 2022). These phenomena raise a con-
cern: although instruction-tuned LLMs are robust
to tiny perturbations of instructions, they are vul-
nerable when facing more significant alterations,
which is far behind human-level generalization .
7.2.3 Instruction diversity
To further improve the robustness of LLMs, espe-
cially when facing significant alterations of instruc-
tion paradigms, people try to promote instruction
diversity during the training phase —for the same
training task, writing multiple instructions in dif-
ferent textual expressions (e.g., different wordings
and lengths), then training LLMs on the mixture
of diverse instructions. Notably, Sanh et al. (2022)
showed that adopting instructions with diverse writ-
ing styles not only improved the model generaliza-
tion but also compensated for the limited model
scale to some extent.
Nevertheless, manually crafting instructions
with diversity is expensive and usually hard to
4https://platform.openai.com/
docs/guides/prompt-engineering/
six-strategies-for-getting-better-resultsachieve due to the human annotation bias (Huynh
et al., 2021; Parmar et al., 2023). Owing to the ex-
cellent annotation quality of LLMs (He et al., 2023;
Pan et al., 2023), a considerable number of works
began to employ models to compose innovative
instructions (Zhang et al., 2020, 2021; Honovich
et al., 2023b). Although the model-generated in-
structions have been proven to contain more noise,
benefiting from the diverse syntax structures (Ki-
taev and Klein, 2018), these instructions could
still show complementary effects with the human-
written instructions (Wang et al., 2023d). More
interestingly, Lou et al. (2024) proposed a new
instruction-following dataset paradigm, where they
employed LLMs to synthesize diverse task instruc-
tions for each input. Benefiting from this paradigm,
the tuned LMs were forced to focus more on the
instruction than the task input, achieving promising
instruction-following performance. All of these
results may imply the profitability of instruction
diversity, even at the expense of the correctness of
instructions .
7.2.4 Add demonstrations or not
Demonstrations, i.e., a couple of input-output ex-
amples, have been shown to be critical for the
expressiveness of task instructions. For example,
existing works found that adding a few positive
demonstrations in the textual instructions could re-
sult in a significant performance improvement on
the unseen tasks (Yin et al., 2022; Deb et al., 2022),
especially for the tasks occupying complex output
space (Mishra et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2022b).
Surprisingly, Gu et al. (2023) further found that
models highly relied on few-shot demonstrations
and even abandoned other useful resources (e.g.,
detailed task definition) when demonstrations were
available. This prominence is perhaps because the
LLMs prefer to exploit the more superficial pat-
terns of the demonstrations rather than the other
complex textual expressions (Min et al., 2022b).
In other words, at present, a comprehensive frame-
work for accurately encoding pure instructions in
the absence of demonstrations or task scaling re-
mains elusive (Lou and Yin, 2023).
7.3 Demonstration-related Factors
Since few-shot demonstrations can impact the
model’s instruction following performance a lot,
recent studies investigated different factors in the
demonstrations, which can further enhance the
model’s demonstration learning efficiency.

--- PAGE 14 ---
7.3.1 The selection of demonstrations
Given an unlabeled test instance (i.e., input-only
instance waiting for the answer from the model),
and a pool of labeled training instances (i.e., input-
output pairs), how to select the better demonstra-
tions from this pool for the test instance is a funda-
mental question for in-context learning.
Liu et al. (2022b) proposed an unsupervised
demonstration selection strategy, where they uti-
lized kNN (kNearest Neighbors) to retrieve the
demonstrations with the closed embedding distance
as the test instance. The key step in the clustering-
based selection methods is the distance metrics,
such as L2 distance, cosine-similarity or mutual
information (Sorensen et al., 2022). In addition to
the clustering-based methods, another branch of
methods used the output score of models as the
selection criterion (Gonen et al., 2023; Wu et al.,
2023; Li and Qiu, 2023). For example, Nguyen
and Wong (2023) tried to select a subset Afrom
the training pool as the demonstrations by mea-
suring the model’s average performance variance
between Aand the complement set A.
Beyond the above unsupervised or weak-
supervised selection strategies, some other works
also employed supervised methods. Wang et al.
(2023a) regarded the LMs as implicit topic models,
where the LMs can generate meaningful concept
representation based on the few-shot demonstra-
tions. By training the topic models, they selected
demonstrations that could maximize the likelihood
of the given concept. Meanwhile, Zhang et al.
(2022b) regarded the demonstration selection as
a Markov decision process (Bellman, 1957) and
proposed a reinforcement learning model via Q-
learning (Jang et al., 2019).
7.3.2 The order of demonstrations
Even with the same set of demonstrations, the dif-
ference in the example order can also impact the
model’s in-context learning performance. Zhao
et al. (2021) emphasized that the GPT-3 is sensitive
to the order of the demonstrations, and they conjec-
tured that this sensitivity potentially comes from
Recency Bias — the tendency to repeat answers
that appear towards the end of the prompt. Lu et al.
(2022) further conducted comprehensive experi-
ments and found that, along with GPT-3, various
models suffer from order sensitivity.
To this end, recent works proposed several meth-
ods to sort a “suitable” example order for the
LMs. For example, based on the Recency Bias ,Liu et al. (2022b) calculated the embedding sim-
ilarity between the demonstrations and the target
input, those more similar examples were put closer
(right more) to the input. Lu et al. (2022) proposed
several entropy-based metrics to search for the best
demonstration order.
7.3.3 Reasoning steps augmentation
Beyond the standard input-by-output demonstra-
tions, augmenting in-context examples with reason-
ing steps is found helpful for the model’s perfor-
mance, especially for the super-large models.
Wei et al. (2022b) proposed chain-of-thoughts
(CoT), where they inserted some human-written in-
termediate reasoning steps (i.e., rationale) between
input and output of in-context demonstration. By
doing so, when predicting the target output, the
models can generate intermediate reasoning steps
as well, thus enhancing the performance on rea-
soning tasks (e.g., math word problems) and the
explainability of LMs. In addition to the human-
written CoT, Xu et al. (2023c) also found that the
CoT synthesized by larger models can assist the
smaller models. Based on the promising results
of adopting CoT, more advanced variations were
proposed for more accurate reasoning, such as
program-of-thoughts (PoT) (Chen et al., 2022a),
tree-of-thoughts (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023), graph-of-
thoughts (GoT) (Besta et al., 2024), and CoT with
self-consistency decoding augmentation (Wang
et al., 2023b).
However, similar to the demonstration sensitiv-
ity, different CoT writing styles can also result in
performance variance. Therefore, in contrast to
the human-craft CoT (i.e., few-shot CoT), Zhang
et al. (2022c) proposed Auto-CoT (i.e., zero-shot
CoT), where they added a “Let’s think step by
step” into the prompt and let the models gener-
ate CoTs themselves. Afterwards, more and more
variations of Auto-CoT were proposed to address
more complicated reasoning tasks. For example,
Self-Ask (Press et al., 2023) asked the model to
first generate several questions regarding the input
and then answer these questions by the model itself
— these self-generated contexts were further used as
the reasoning rationales to help answer the original
input. Similarly, Least-to-Most (Zhou et al., 2022)
asked the model to decompose an origin complex
input into several sub-questions and answer them
subsequently, which can be used as the rationales
as well.

--- PAGE 15 ---
7.3.4 Emphasizing input-output mappings
For in-context learning, the model usually cannot
directly “learn” the input-output mapping from the
given examples because there is no parameter up-
date for the models. Therefore, one issue of in-
context learning is that, when conducting instruc-
tion following, the demonstrations are not necessar-
ily needed for the model to solve the task (i.e., even
without the few-shot demonstrations, the model
can still make predictions). Min et al. (2022b) also
found that the model is more likely to “copy” the
output candidate from the demonstrations, instead
of truly learning the underlying mapping.
To this end, Wei et al. (2023) proposed symbol
tuning. Different from conventional instruction fol-
lowing, which tunes the models to follow input-by-
output demonstrations to complete the target input,
symbol tuning uses some unrelated symbols to re-
place the origin outputs of the demonstrations. For
example, the origin output space of the demonstra-
tions might be “positive” and “negative”; symbol
tuning uses “Foo” and “Bar” instead. After losing
the semantics of the output spaces, there are no
prior label biases (Zhao et al., 2021) for the mod-
els to rely on to make the final prediction, so the
models are forced to figure out the input-output
mapping in the context.
7.4 Model-Instruction Alignment
This factor refers to making the procedure of in-
struction following better conform to the prefer-
ence of LLMs. One aspect is the training ob-
jective. Since the current instruction following
paradigm mainly employs the LLMs as the sys-
tem backbone, one of the potential explanations for
why LLM-oriented Instructions (i.e., prompt) can
work is that prompt aligns well with the pretrain-
ing objective—language modeling—and activates
the task-specific knowledge of the LLMs. Some
existing works demonstrated the importance of con-
forming to the pretraining objective of LLMs when
doing instruction following (Schick and Schütze,
2021c; Tay et al., 2023), such as recalling language
modeling objectives in fine-tuning phase (Iyer et al.,
2022). Another aspect of model preference align-
ment is the way of designing instructions: that
is, converting the instructions into model-oriented
styles (Deng et al., 2022). For example, using soft
instructions (i.e., continuous embedding) instead of
human-understandable discrete instructions (Lester
et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2022a). Itis consistent with the empirical guidelines estab-
lished in the field of prompt engineering, which em-
phasize the significance of model-oriented prompt
design.5Despite the performance profits, it is
still controversial whether it is worthwhile to con-
vert the original human-oriented instructions into a
LLM-oriented style, because it always impairs the
interpretability of instructions and is highly con-
trary to human intuition (Khashabi et al., 2022;
Webson and Pavlick, 2022; Prasad et al., 2023).
7.5 Data-wise Factor: Task Scale
The task scale often refers to the number of differ-
ent training task categories in the dataset. Since
“data-wise factor” also includes the scale of training
instances, Wang et al. (2022b) investigated the im-
pact of both task and instance scales. They found
that instance scale (fixed task number, increasing
the number of instances per task) can only bring a
limited performance boost, while task scale is the
key factor for instruction following, in line with
the observations of other works (Wei et al., 2022a;
Chung et al., 2022). As illustrated in Figure 4, the
same-size model with more tuning tasks usually
gains better performance. However, the perfor-
mance improvement of scaling up tasks is unstable,
especially when the model size is too small (e.g.,
0.08B Flan-T5). This phenomenon aligns with the
discussion in § 7.1, we can draw a similar conclu-
sion here: the profits of the task scale are highly
governed by the model scale.
7.6 Main Takeaway: Dual-Track Scaling
Among all the factors discussed in this section,
scaling is arguably the core factor that leads to the
success of instruction following. Prior to LLM-
based instruction following, scaling was mainly
for deep learning models: from single-layer neu-
ral nets to multi-layer perceptions, from convo-
lutional/recurrent neural networks to deep-layer
transformers (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997;
LeCun et al., 1998; Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin
et al., 2019b). Along with the pretraining of mas-
sive raw text data, the ever-increasing models are
expected to have encoded a vast amount of generic-
purpose knowledge (Zhou et al., 2023a). In the
era of instruction following, where the commu-
nity is more interested in cross-task generalization,
merely scaling LLMs seems not enough. Thus, re-
searchers take a parallel scaling: to collect more
5Using prefix prompts for the auto-regressive LMs, while
using cloze prompts for the masked LMs (Liu et al., 2023a).

--- PAGE 16 ---
and more training tasks and labeled examples for
each. We interpret this as a dual-track scaling .
Overall, this dual-track scaling jointly seeks super-
vision to solve new tasks—the supervision either
comes from LLMs’ pretraining or substantial train-
ing tasks. Despite its progress, some notable chal-
lenges remain in this area, which we will discuss
in the next section.
8 Challenges and Future Directions
Despite all the aforementioned benefits of instruc-
tion, tons of under-explored challenges remain in
this area. In this section, we list several chal-
lenges related to the instruction following, which
are worthwhile for future research to investigate.
8.1 The Tax of Instruction Alignment
The instruction following aims at taming the mod-
els to better assist humans in real-world tasks;
therefore, in addition to pursuing ultimate perfor-
mance, inference-time safety is also a crucial aspect
for the instruction-tuned models (i.e., instruction
alignment). Ouyang et al. (2022) defined “align-
ment” with three criteria — Helpful ,Honest , and
Harmless (HHH), which has been widely consid-
ered by the previous instruction tuning models and
datasets (Bai et al., 2022b; Yin et al., 2023; Wang
et al., 2023d; Lou et al., 2024). However, align-
ment can also bring “tax” to the instruction-tuned
models. For example, Bekbayev et al. (2023) found
that the well-aligned answers provided in the in-
struction following datasets can drop the model’s
performance a lot on various task benchmarks. This
implies a trade-off between performance and safety
for instruction following, which requires careful
consideration.
8.2 Learning Negated Information
Negation is the common linguistic property and has
been found to be crucial for various NLP tasks, e.g.,
NLI (Naik et al., 2018; Kassner and Schütze, 2020).
Specific to instruction following, negation denotes
anythings-to-avoid information of in-context in-
structions, including negated requirements (e.g.,
“avoid using stop words ”) and negative demon-
strations (i.e., some wrong examples). Although
humans can learn a lot from the negation (Dudschig
and Kaup, 2018), existing works found LLMs often
fail to follow the negated instructions; some nega-
tions can even drop models’ performance (Li et al.,
2022b; Jang et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2022a).Since negation has increasingly become a chal-
lenge in instruction following, we provide several
hints to inspire future work. One potential solu-
tion is unlikelihood training (Hosseini et al., 2021;
Ye et al., 2022b), which trains the LLMs to min-
imize the ground truth probability when negated
instructions are conditioned. Besides, Yin et al.
(2022) proposed pretraining the LMs on the neg-
ative demonstrations with maximizing likelihood
objective to exploit the useful information in the
negation. Some other methods, such as contrast-
consistent projection (Burns et al., 2023) and n-
gram representations (Sun and Lu, 2022), also pro-
vided insights into tackling this problem.
8.3 Adversarial Instruction Attacks
Though most of the instruction-tuned LMs can
align well with human preferences and provide
harmless responses, recent works found that they
could easily be attacked — the model’s response
can be manipulated by using simple prompting
strategies. Kang et al. (2023) designed several
prompts to trigger the LLMs to generate malicious
content. For example, instead of directly provid-
ing malicious instruction with obviously harmful
intentions, they split the instruction into several
pieces (each piece itself doesn’t trigger the LLMs’
defence mechanism). In doing this, those powerful
preference-aligned LLMs, such as ChatGPT and
InstructGPT, were successfully fooled and gener-
ated harmful content. Li et al. (2023b) also found
that the retrieval-augmented generation models can
be easily attacked by injecting adversarial ques-
tions into the retrieved context. Besides attacking
the instruction-tuned LLMs, Wan et al. (2023) con-
cluded that LLMs can also be attacked during in-
struction following. Based on the clean instances,
they automatically created a few poisoned exam-
ples to train the LLMs and found that the resulting
LLMs could be manipulated by using some trigger
words.
Since instruction-tuned LLMs have been applied
to various real-world scenarios, such as web agents
and search engines (Deng et al., 2023; Xie et al.,
2024a), the safety of LLMs’ generations is becom-
ing more urgent. Simply conducting preference
alignment or content filtering seems to be insuf-
ficient, especially for those super-strong LLMs.
Thus, developing efficient defence methods is nec-
essary for the current instruction-tuned models.
Meanwhile, further deep analyses of LLMs’ vulner-

--- PAGE 17 ---
ability are also critical, potentially providing more
insights into the defence.
8.4 Explainability of Instruction Following
As we have mentioned in § 7, to achieve a promis-
ing cross-task performance, one of the critical
factors is to convert the Human-oriented Instruc-
tions intoLLM-oriented Instructions , i.e., making
the instructions conform to the model’s preference.
Numerous previous works have verified the effec-
tiveness of catering to the model’s preference in
designing instructions, e.g., using the model’s per-
plexity in choosing appropriate instructions (Gonen
et al., 2023). Despite the performance gains, the
resulting instructions consistently violate human
intuitions and show worrying reliability, such as
some semantically incoherent, task-irrelevant, or
even misleading instructions (Khashabi et al., 2022;
Prasad et al., 2023). These results prove the con-
flict between performance profits and the human
interpretability of instructions, which is tricky to
trade-off.
Although Mishra et al. (2022a) demonstrated
that it is possible to maintain both the faithfulness
and effectiveness of instructions, manual rewriting
requires laborious human efforts. Therefore, one
of the future trends is to investigate how to auto-
matically rephrase the instructions, in a way that
matches both human and model preferences.
8.5 Learning to Follow Instruction rather
than Merely Generating Y
Multi-task instruction following is becoming a fun-
damental practice in the current instruction follow-
ing paradigm. However, there are two issues in
such a learning paradigm: (i) it relies on training
on massive labeled examples to learn the instruc-
tions, which is still expensive and unrealistic for
using large-scale LLMs; (ii) although the ultimate
goal of instruction following is learning to follow
instructions by observing various training tasks, the
current training objective is still the conventional
maximum likelihood of reference outputs. This
implicit instruction following objective can lead to
sub-optimal optimization (i.e., LLMs can learn to
generate YforXwithout really understanding the
meaning of instructions I).
To this end, one desired future direction is to
evolve a new learning objective to help LLMs ex-
plicitly learn to follow instructions, which might al-
leviate the reliance on large-scale labeled instances.
Moreover, a more ambitious and challenging ideais to drive the system to follow instructions without
additional tuning on the labeled examples of any
specific tasks (Ye et al., 2023), which is somehow
similar to semantic parser-based paradigm (§ 5).
8.6 Multi-Lingual Instruction Following
Intuitively, the instruction following is language-
agnostic capacity for the language models, which
means that it is also possible for the multi-lingual
language models to follow the same semantic in-
structions with different languages. For exam-
ple, Kew et al. (2023) found LLMs tuned with
more than three languages exhibit stronger instruc-
tion following capacity, implying the benefits of
multi-lingual instruction tuning. Unfortunately,
most of the current open-sourced instruction fol-
lowing datasets and foundation models are English-
centric (as shown in Table 6). Therefore, the re-
lease of high-quality multi-lingual instruction tun-
ing datasets (with pair translation) should be valu-
able for future research, as also mentioned by Peng
et al. (2023).
9 Instruction-related Applications
In addition to the main body of our paper, we also
survey some popular instruction-related application
directions to inspire future board-wide utilization
for instruction following.
9.1 Human-Computer Interaction
Textual instructions can be naturally regarded as a
human-computer interaction method. Numerous
previous works employed natural language instruc-
tions to guide the computer to perform various real-
world tasks.
For the non-NLP (multi-modal) tasks, most fo-
cused on environment-grounded language learn-
ing, i.e., driving the agent to associate natural
language instructions with the environments and
make corresponding reactions, such as selecting
mentioned objects from an image/video (Matuszek
et al., 2012; Krishnamurthy and Kollar, 2013; Puig
et al., 2018), following navigational instructions
to move the agent (Tellex et al., 2011; Kim and
Mooney, 2012; Chen, 2012; Artzi and Zettlemoyer,
2013; Bisk et al., 2016), plotting corresponding
traces on a map (V ogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen
and Mooney, 2011), playing soccer/card games
based on given rules (Kuhlmann et al., 2004; Eisen-
stein et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2011; Babe¸ s-
Vroman et al., 2012; Goldwasser and Roth, 2011),

--- PAGE 18 ---
generating real-time sports broadcast (Chen and
Mooney, 2008; Liang et al., 2009), controlling
software (Branavan et al., 2010), and querying ex-
ternal databases (Clarke et al., 2010), etc. Mean-
while, instructions are also widely adapted to help
communicate with the system in solving NLP
tasks, e.g., following instructions to manipulate
strings (Gaddy and Klein, 2019), classifying emails
based on the given explanations (Srivastava et al.,
2017, 2018), and text-to-code generation (Acqua-
viva et al., 2022).
Recently, a growing body of research tended to
design the human-computer communication proce-
dure in an iterative andmodular manner (Dwivedi-
Yu et al., 2022; Chakrabarty et al., 2022). For
example, Li et al. (2020) built a system to help
the users tackle daily missions (e.g., ordering cof-
fee or requesting Uber). Benefiting from a user-
friendly graphical interface, the system can iter-
atively ask questions about the tasks, and users
can continually refine their instructions to avoid
unclear descriptions or vague concepts. As it is
usually hard for non-expert users to write sufficient
instructions in one shot, adapting an iterative and
modular paradigm in designing instruction-based
AI systems can help guide the users to enrich the
task instruction step by step. Thus, this paradigm
efficiently relieves the thinking demands of users
and leads to a more user-oriented system (Mishra
and Nouri, 2023). Due to its practical values, we
emphasize the importance of this branch of work
in this paper.
9.2 Data and Feature Augmentation
Task instructions are regarded as indirect supervi-
sion resources where sometimes superficial and
assertive rules are embedded. These rules are also
known as labeling functions that can be directly
applied for annotations.6Therefore, some exist-
ing works also employed the instruction as a dis-
tant supervision to perform data or feature aug-
mentation (Srivastava et al., 2018; Hancock et al.,
2018; Ye et al., 2020). For instance, Srivastava
et al. (2017) used a semantic parser to convert nat-
ural language explanations into logical forms, and
applied them on all instances in the dataset to gen-
erate additional binary features. Wang et al. (2020)
utilized the label explanations to annotate the raw
corpus automatically and trained the classifier on
6For example, if “a very fair price” is sentiment-positive,
every sentence with a similar adj-noun collocation as “fair
price” will be positive as well.the resulting noisy data.
Besides the straightforward augmentation, Su
et al. (2023) further used the task instruction to en-
rich the model representation and achieved strong
cross-task generalization. Specifically, they trained
an embedding model (a single encoder) on the di-
verse instruction datasets with contrastive learning,
and then used this model to produce task-specific
representations based on the instruction for the
downstream unseen tasks.
9.3 Generalist Language Models
According to the definition of Artificial General In-
telligence (AGI), the “generalist model” is usually
a system that can be competent for different tasks
and scalable in changeable contexts, which shall
go far beyond the initial anticipations of its cre-
ators (Wang and Goertzel, 2007; Goertzel, 2014).
While specific to the NLP domain, a generalist lan-
guage model is supposed to be an excellent multi-
task assistant, that is skilled in handling a variety
of real-world NLP tasks and different languages, in
a completely zero/few-shot manner (Arivazhagan
et al., 2019; Pratap et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022a).
As numerous existing works demonstrated the in-
credible power of using instructions in cross-task
generalization (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022;
Mishra et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2022b; Chung
et al., 2022, inter alia ), the instruction is likely to
become a breakthrough in achieving this ultimate
goal.
Notably, the recent remarkable applications of
instructions, namely InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and
GPT-4, also indicated a big step towards building
generalist language models. For example, during
the pretraining of LLama-2, Touvron et al. (2023)
utilized the idea of context distilling to inculcate
instructions within LLMs, thus addressing the in-
consistency issue of instruction following in the
multi-turn dialogue situation. OpenAI GPT-series
adopt RLHF to align the model’s preference with
human instructions, where feedback supervision
plays a big role. Although the answer to “ Is instruc-
tion or human feedback, that contributes more to
the performance of ChatGPT? ” remains ambiguous
and needs further investigation, we introduce some
recent works highlighting the critical role of instruc-
tion following. For example, Chung et al. (2022)
conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the
human-preference alignments of PaLM (Chowdh-
ery et al., 2023). They found that, even without any

--- PAGE 19 ---
human feedback, the instruction following signifi-
cantly reduced the toxicity in the open-ended gen-
erations of PaLM, such as gender and occupation
bias. In addition, some other works also solely em-
ployed creative instructions instead of human feed-
back and achieved notable cross-task results (Bai
et al., 2022b; Honovich et al., 2023a; Wang et al.,
2023d). Furthermore, as the knowledge conflict
problem of LLMs has a significant impact on the
applications of instruction-tuned models (Xie et al.,
2024a), in order to make the LLMs more general-
ist and useful in the real world, recent works also
utilized the idea of the instruction following to en-
hance the retrieval-augmented language models,
and vice versa, improve the instructions by adopt-
ing retrieved knowledge (Lin et al., 2023).
10 Conclusion
This survey summarizes the existing literature on
instruction following, providing a comprehensive
overview of the field, including instruction tax-
onomies, modeling strategies, and key aspects of in-
struction utilization. It also addresses unique chal-
lenges and offers hints for future research. Unlike
previous works, we go beyond the limited scope of
modern instruction following—we trace the studies
of instruction following back to the early stage of
machine learning, and explore textual instruction
as an indirect supervision for LLMs. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first extensive survey on instruc-
tion following. Overall, we aim to offer valuable
insights and inspire further in-depth research in this
area.
