Abstract
In this work we explore recent advances in instruction-tuning language models on
a range of open instruction-following datasets. Despite recent claims that open
modelscanbeonparwithstate-of-the-artproprietarymodels,theseclaimsareoften
accompaniedbylimitedevaluation,makingitdifficulttocomparemodelsacross
the board and determine the utility of various resources. We provide a large set of
instruction-tunedmodelsfrom6.7Bto65Bparametersinsize,trainedon12instruc-
tion datasets ranging from manually curated (e.g., OpenAssistant) to synthetic and
distilled(e.g.,Alpaca)andsystematicallyevaluatethemontheirfactualknowledge,

abilities through a collection of automatic, model-based, and human-based metrics.
We further introduce TÜLU

Our experiments show that different instruction-tuning datasets can uncover or
enhance specific skills, while no single dataset (or combination) provides the best
performanceacrossallevaluations. Interestingly,wefindthatmodelandhuman

include tasks that test core reasoning and fact-recall skills of the model, in addition to testing model-
or human-annotated generation quality, which may be more open-ended and subjective.
This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuning resources: specifically, we
conduct a large number of instruction tuning experiments spanning a dozen public corpora, and
models ranging in scale from 6.7B to 65B. We evaluate both specific model capabilities (i.e., factual
knowledge, reasoning, multilinguality, coding, safety) and open-ended instruction-following abilities.
We report results based on automatic, model-based, and human-based evaluation metrics.
Our evaluation reveals that instruction tuning over different datasets appears to promote specific
skills, and no one dataset provides the best performance across all evaluations. We also find that
theunderlyingbasemodelisparamount,withbetterbasemodels(whetheritbemodelstrainedon
more tokens or larger models) performing better across the board. Surprisingly, we also find that the
best-performing models in model-based evaluation are not the same as those that perform best on
benchmark-based automatic evaluations, potentially partially due to GPT-4’s strong bias toward long,
diverse generations.
Building on our findings, we introduce TÜLU
, a suite of 7B to 65B LLAMAmodels finetuned on a
combination of data sources. TÜLU
65B is the largest publicly-released fully-instruction tuned
LLAMAvariantatthetimeofwriting,tothebestoftheauthors’knowledge. Itistrainedon7popular
available datasets, and yields the best average performance across most model sizes while remaining
within 29% of the best-performing model on each individual task. In summary, our key findings
include:
•Instruction datasets targeted at specific domains and/or capabilities are extremely effective at
improving model performance in those aspects.
•Larger or pretrained-for-longer base models consistently perform better than smaller ones after
instruction tuning.
•Ourmodel TÜLU

2 Background: Instruction Tuning and Resources
2.1 Instruction Tuning
Instruction tuning , in general, refers to the practice of finetuning pretrained language models to better
understandandrespondtoawidevarietyofhumanrequeststhatareexpressedinnaturallanguage
[32,49,35]. In particular, instruction tuning is concerned with requests that include some indication
of the task to be performed within the request itself (e.g., including task instructions in the input
prompt). Ithasarisenasacriticalstepforgeneralizingmodelstonewscenarioswithoutdedicated
training, and for letting non-experts naturally interact with these models. The training paradigms
of instruction tuning can vary from supervised learning using demonstrations [ 49,39,48,31] to
reinforcement learning from feedback data [ 35,3]. In this work, we focus on the supervised learning
setupconsideringthecurrentopenresourcesfortheRL-basedapproacharestillrare,andweleaveits
exploration for future work.
The success of instruction tuning requires at least two key components: 1) a powerful pretrained
language model that has grasped a vast amount of knowledge from web-scale pretraining, and 2) an
instruction dataset that is diverse and representative enough to adapt the LM to potential downstream
usage. We study these two factors in this work and introduce our studied open resources below.

3.3 TÜLU
: a Better Instruction-Tuned Model by Combining Resources
Existing studies [ 48,31] (and our own evaluation below) have shown that increasing the diversity of
instructions can effectively improve the performance of instruction tuning. Following this motivation,
we create two mixtures of datasets:
Humandatamixture ,whichcomprisesthebesthuman-authoreddatasets,includingFLANV2,CoT,
Dolly, and Open Assistant 1 (we exclude SuperNI as FLAN V2 includes most tasks in SuperNI);
Human+GPT data mixture , which comprises the human mixture and three additional datasets that
have generations by OpenAI GPT models, including GPT4-Alpaca, Code-Alpaca, and ShareGPT.
For both mixtures, we concatenate datasets and leave exploring more complex sampling mixtures to
future work. We name LLAMAmodels trained on the Human+GPT data mixture TÜLU
, after
a hybrid camel resulting from interbreeding between different species. We differentiate the TÜLU
models trained from the LL AMA-2 base models by versioning them as TÜLU-1.1.
4 Evaluation Setup
Evaluation of instruction-following models remains a challenging problem due to the enormous
scope of “generality” and its open-ended nature. However, we argue that general-purpose models
should be able to perform some core tasks before they can generalize to satisfy various practical
needs. As such, we set up a multi-faceted evaluation to cover several key aspects of capabilities
coveringcoreabilitiesandopen-endedinstructionfollowing. Ourevaluationscloselyfollowprior
work on evaluating instruction-tuned models [ 9,2,47,8,16], but serve as the first one to compile
them together for systematic evaluation.
4.1 Facets of Evaluation
Factualknowledge isessentialforlanguagemodelstoserveusers’informationneeds. Weusethe
Massive Multitask Language Understanding dataset (MMLU [ 22]) for measuring models’ factual
knowledge. MMLU consists of a set of questions about 57 subjects ranging in difficulty from
elementary levels to professional levels, and its multiple-choice format makes it suitable for probing
models’ knowledge without worrying about the open-endedness of generations.

Reasoning isanotherfundamentalabilityformodels,especiallyforsolvingcomplextasks. Weuse
the test split of Grade School Math dataset (GSM [ 11]) to evaluate models’ mathematical reasoning
capabilities. We also adopt Big-Bench-Hard (BBH [ 42]), which contains 23 challenging tasks from
Big-Bench [41], to evaluate models’ general reasoning capabilities.
Multilinguality actsasanimportantperspectiveofmodelsforservingpeoplefromdifferentback-
grounds. We use TyDiQA [ 10], a multilingual question answering benchmark covering 11 typo-
logicallydiverselanguagesfortestinghowmuchmodelscanprocessnon-Engishtext. Weusethe
gold-passage setup where one passage containing the reference answer is given.
Codingis a particular application that people have used language models for and might be important
forintegratingthesemodelswithexternaltools[ 5]. WeusetheHumanEvaldataset[ 7]toevaluate
the models’ capability to generate functionally correct programs from docstrings. To avoid ambiguity
with our human evaluation, we call this dataset Codex-Eval in this paper.
Open-ended instruction following. While the performance on the benchmarks above quantifies the
models’ ability at specific skills, it may not reflect how well the models can handle instructions from
realusers,whichcoverhighlydiverserequestsandareoftenopen-ended. Forexample,thepopular
ShareGPT dataset containsinstances of users asking for programminghelp, resume formatting tips,
educationalrole-playing,pronunciationsuggestion,fanfictionwriting,andmore. Weevaluatesuch
open-endedinstructabilityofmodelsusingbothmodel-basedevaluation(§4.2)andhumanevaluation
(§4.3), both of which consist of multiple test sets from existing studies [47, 8, 26, 3, 19].
Safetyisofparticularconcernregardingthefast-developinglanguagemodelstoensuretheethical
and proper use of them. Following LLAMA-2 [45], we employ ToxiGen [ 21] to measure the amount
of toxic language and hate speech generation across different groups when the models are prompted
todoso. WealsoadoptTruthfulQA[ 30]tomeasurehowwellmodelscanavoidgeneratingknown
falsehoods due to misconceptions or false beliefs while providing useful information.
For all the benchmark-based evaluations, we follow their standard metrics, while we subsample some
benchmarkstoareasonablesizetoimprovetheefficiencyofdoingchain-of-thoughtreasoning. We
refer the reader to Appendix §E for the setup details.
4.2 Model-Based Evaluation using GPT-4
To evaluate the open-ended instructability, we first adopt a model-based approach introduced in
AlpacaEval[ 27]. Thetestsetconsistsof805instructions,with252instructionsfromtheSelf-Instruct
evaluation [ 47], 188 from the Open Assistant evaluation [ 26], 129 from the helpful evaluation by
Anthropic [3], 80 from the Vicuna evaluation [8], and 156 from the Koala evaluation [19].
We use their simulated GPT-4 annotator, which computes the win rate of the testing model as judged
by GPT-4 when compared to the outputs produced by Davinci-003. We use the AlpacaEval codebase
andprompts[ 27]tomakeourscoresdirectlycomparabletothoseontheAlpacaEvalleaderboard4
When doing pairwise comparisons with GPT-4, the orders of model outputs are randomized to avoid
position bias during evaluation [ 46]. We do not evaluate vanilla LLAMAmodels due to them having
little instruction-following ability without further prompt engineering.
4.3 Human Evaluation

5 Results
5.1 Analysis of Instruction Tuning Datasets and Base Models
TounderstandhowtheinstructiondatasetslistedinTable1contributetomodelabilities,weevaluated
LLaMa 13B models trained on these datasets using our evaluation suite. Table 3 shows the results on
our benchmark evaluation set, with more extensive results in App. F. We find that:
There is not a single best instruction tuning dataset across all tasks . Different datasets enable
different capabilities in the model. Noteworthy examples include training on CoT being particularly
helpful for mathematical reasoning in GSM and Code-Alpaca being helpful for Codex-Eval. We
hypothesizethatsuccessonthesetasks,whicharesignificantlydifferentfromtherestoftheevaluation
tasks, calls for training sets where these tasks are well-represented. Apart from constructing task-
specificdatasetsmanually,distillingtask-specificdatafromlargemodelsalsoappearstobeaneffective
way to ensure this (e.g., CodeAlpaca is distilled from Davinci-003).
Combining datasets results in the best overall performance on the benchmark tasks. While

Thelateradditionof LLAMA-2confirmsthisfindingbyshowingasignificantimprovementcancome

Some datasets degrade vanilla model performance. Notably, most datasets we evaluate cause
degradation in performance on GSM and TydiQA over the vanilla base model. We hypothesise
thisisduetodatastyleandquality. Manyofthedatasetsweexaminecontainlittletonoexamples
ofchain-of-thought-stylereasoningandcontainlittletonomultilingualdata. Assuch,trainingon
these datasets likely results in some forgetting of the CoT or multilingual abilities previously held
by the model, resulting in degraded performance. Additionally, we note that self-instruct appears
tocausedegradationsacrossmosttasks,whichwehypothesiseisduetotherelativelypoorquality
of the original self-instruct data, being generated by a weaker model (base GPT-3) than the other
GPT-distilled datasets.
5.2 Pushing the Limits of Open Models
Having established that (a) using a broad mix of data is best, and (b) using LLAMAas the base
model is preferable to other open alternatives, we compare the performance of models trained on the
Human+GPT data mix (T ÜLUmodels) across all LL AMAsizes in Table 5. We find that:

LLAMAmodels improve considerably after instruction tuning.

to avoid forgetting the base model’s original capabilities.

possibility that either ChatGPT or GPT-4 was trained on significant portions of our evaluation
suite. However, the presence of asignificant gap between TÜLUmodels and ChatGPT matches our
findings in the model and human-based evaluations, which are less likely to be compromised.

SuperNI all perform extremely poorly in open-ended instruction following, despite these datasets
providing large improvements to the model capabilities tested in Table 3.

other tasks, we do not believe that GPT-4 evaluation is merely counting unique tokens, but this result
highlights how model preference scores do not necessarily reward only model capabilities.

ShareGPT performs best. We find that ShareGPT consistently performs best across all model
sizes, including models trained on data mixes that include ShareGPT. Models trained on ShareGPT
achievehigher win-ratesthanmodelsover twicetheirsize(e.g., 13BShareGPTvs65B TÜLU). We
hypothesizethisisduetoShareGPT’sdiversity,size,andthehighaverage #tokensoftargetresponses.
Overall, these results suggest that while model preference evaluation is important, it does not provide
aholisticevaluation of these models. Instead, model preference evaluation should only be included
as part of a larger, more comprehensive evaluation setup.

AlpacaEvalandbenchmark-basedevaluation : allevaluationsshowthat65B TÜLUoutperforms
7BTÜLU, suggesting making use of larger base models is important, and there is still a nontrivial
gap in performance between 65B TÜLUand ChatGPT. We also find that making use of distilled
datasets provides a large performance boost , suggesting that human-authored datasets are lacking
in comparison. These observations are also consistent with the acceptability scores in Figure 3.
However, we note that 7B TÜLUoutperforms the human-mix 65B TÜLUin the model preference
evaluation, but if we compare the acceptability scores in Figure 3, the opposite appears true. This is
furtherevidencethatmodelpairwiseevaluationmaynotalwaysrevealmodeldeficiencies. Inthis
case, the 65B human-mix model is more likely to yield acceptable (if not high-quality) responses
than the 7B model.

7 Conclusion
In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation of a wide variety of publicly-available resources for
instruction-tuning models, and compare them to the strongest proprietary models currently available.
We find that using strong base models is vital to performance, combining datasets works best on
average (but does result in slight performance drops compared to best performance in specific tasks),
andourstrongestopenmodelsdonotyetmatchChatGPTorGPT-4. Furthermore,webelievethat
our evaluation highlights the need for the continued development of strong base models and broader,
diverse datasets. Finally, we hope that our evaluation and released code and models enable more

A Limitations
Despite the comprehensiveness of our evaluations, we note that we did not exhaustively cover all
possible evaluations: for example, we do not explicitly evaluate models on their multi-turn dialogue
abilitiesnortheirsummarizationabilities. Instead,wefocusonacoresetofcapabilitieswebelieve
important, and cover broad open-ended tasks via our model and human preference-based evaluations.
We also note that we do not cover all possible instruction datasets and open models released re-
cently, due to the computational cost of doing this. Instead, we focus on a wide set of datasets we
believe are broadly representative of the type of open instruction datasets available (human-authored,
skill-targeted, GPT-distilled, etc), and focused on the strongest base model widely available when
performingexperiments. Futureworkcouldinvestigatewhethermorerecentstrongbasemodels(e.g.,
theFalconmodel[ 1]),orotherinstructiondatasets,performsignificantlybetterordifferentlyfrom
the models explored in this work.
Finally, we note that open-ended instruction-based evaluation is highly subjective and difficult due to
its extremely open-ended nature. There is likely no one answer that is definitively the best for any
given query, anddifferentannotators (whethertheybe humanormodel)will havedifferentbiases
and preferences. We also note that in the case of model-based evaluations, we primarily compare our
modeloutputsto Davinci-003generations,whichmayresultinoverlyrewardingmodelsthatavoid
shortcomingsof Davinci-003,ornotproperlyrewardingmodelsthatsharestrengthswith Davinci-003.
Despitenotbeingcompletelyexhaustiveinthiswork,webelievethatbycoveringabroadrangeof
models, it still serves as a useful and important contribution in showing what type of open resources
work,andwherefuturecommunityeffortsshouldgo(betterbasemodels,morediverseinstruction-
tuning datasets).
B Broader Impact
We believe that a rigorous evaluation of existing resources is broadly positive, exposing the strengths
anddeficienciesofcurrentlywidely-availableresources. Furthermore,asallresourcesusedarewidely
available, the harm posed by training these models is fairly small. We do note that training and
releasingespeciallylargeinstruction-tunedmodelswithoutwell-testedguidescarriesadegreeofrisk,
andsuchinitiallyreleaseourlargestmodelswithagatedsetup(requiringuserstoapplyforaccess
and be manually approved) to limit potential harms.

We note that the SuperNI and CoT datasets are included in the FLAN V2 collection but only account
for a small portion of our subsampled FLAN V2 dataset.
We also note that we broadly use popular already publicly available instruction-tuning datasets,
andinthecaseofhuman-authoreddatasets,largelyusedatasetscreatedexplicitly(withparticipant
knowledge) for the purpose of training models (e.g., Dolly, Open Assistant 1). As instruction-tuning

D Model Training Details and Compute
Wetrainallmodelsfortwoepochswithalearningrateof 2𝑒−5(1𝑒−5for30Band65Bmodels),with
no weight decay and a learning rate with linear decay and linear warmup for 3% of the total training
steps. Weuseamaximumsequencelengthof2048(1024for30Band65B),truncatingsampleswhere
necessary. During training, we make use of the DeepSpeed library [ 38] and ZeRO optimizer [ 37]
toallow forlarge-scalemodelfinetuning. Inallcases, wefullyfinetunemodels. Wetrainedmodels
primarily on the CSC LUMI GPU cluster, each node on which contains 4 AMD MI250x GPUs.
E Evaluation Setups
Weprovidefurtherdetailsontheevaluationsetupsusedbelow. Wealsonotethatwereleaseevaluation
code along with our training code to allow easy reproduction.
•MMLU: We use the official MMLU evaluation script and prompts available at https://github.
com/hendrycks/test , with modifications to allow for batch processing. We evaluate using 0
and 5 few-shot examples, following the original setup of MMLU.
•GSM: We evaluate models on the test set of GSM. Following Wei et al. [50], we evaluate with
andwithoutchain-of-thought(CoTvsDirect). Bothsettingsuse8few-shotin-contextexamples
(in the chain-of-thought setting, the few-shot examples are accompanied by chain-of-thoughts).
Because all answers in GSM are numbers, we extract the last number in the model response as the
finalanswer. Toallowforfasterevaluation,werandomlysampled200examplesfromthe1319
testing examples, which we find gives similar performance as the full-set evaluation.
•BBH:WefollowthesetupdescribedintheoriginalpaperSuzgunetal. [42],andevaluatewithand
without chain-of-thought (CoT vs Direct). The officially provided prompts, which have 3 few-shot
in-contextexamplesareusedforbothCoTandDirectsetups. FortheCoTsetup,weextractthefirst
word after the phrase ‘So the answer is’, or the entire response if there is no such substring present.

•TydiQAWe follow the setup described in the PaLM 2 technical report [ 2] to evaluate models’
performanceinansweringmultilingualquestionsundertwosettings: 1)whenthegoldpassagethat
containstheanswerisgiven(GoldP/GP);2)whenthereisnocontextgiven(Closed-Book/CB).
One in-context example is used to familiarize the model with the answering format.
•Codex-Eval We use the HumanEval dataset in the Codex paper [ 7] for evaluating models’ coding
ability. The dataset contains 164 programming problems, where models are prompted to complete
the Python function given its docstring. Following the original paper, we compute unbiased
estimates of pass@k to measure the functional correctness of models’ outputs. We report both
pass@1andpass@10. Thepass@1resultswereobtainedbysamplingwithatemperatureof0.1
and the pass@10 results with a temperature of 0.8.
•ToxiGen We follow the setup in Touvron et al. [45], but use the original set of prompts from
Hartvigsenetal. [21],whicharedesignedtoelicittoxicgenerationsforcertaingroups. Wetake
only the prompts designed to produce toxic language (‘hateful’ prompts) and use 500 prompts
pergroup toreduceevaluationcosts. Forbaselanguage models,wepassin theoriginalToxiGen

•TruthfulQA FollowingTouvronetal. [45],wemainlyusethegenerationsettingofTrutufulQA
[30]. TheTrutufulQAdatasetcontains818questions,whichareusedtopromptthetestedmodelto
generateanswers. WeusethedefaultQApromptformatwith6in-contextQAexamples. Wefollow
theofficialscriptintheirofficialimplemention6todogreedydecodingandanswerpostprocessing.
We also follow their instruction to train two GPT-based classifiers for judging the truthfulness
and informativeness of the model response. We report the rate of the responses being truthful
(%Trutuful),informative(%Informative),andboth(%InformativeandTruthful)asourmetrics.
Following Touvron et al. [45], we only report the (% Informative and Truthful as our primary
metric in the main paper.
•AlpacaEval We use the package provided by Li et al. [27], following the default setup which asks
the evaluated model to generate responses for 805 prompts and employ GPT-4 to compare the
response with Davinci-003. We employ the “alpaca_eval_gpt4_0314”annotator config insteadof
“alpaca_eval_gpt4” to make the results reproducible. We allow the evaluated model to generate up
to 8192 tokens, without specifying special stop sequences. The reported win-rate is the percentage
of model generations that GPT-4 reports as being preferred over the generations from Davinci-003.
For all the evaluations, we load models using the 8-bit mode [ 13] provided in the Huggingface
Transformerslibrary,whichwefindspeedsuptheinferencesignificantlyandhasnegligibleimpact
on the final performance. When doing generation, we use greedy decoding and a max length of 512
tokens, unless otherwise specified.
F Overview of All Automatic Evaluation Results
Table 8 presents a compilation of the results of all models trained as part of this work on all the
corecapabilityevaluationbenchmarks. Welistmultiplescenariosforallevaluationsettingsexcept

also calculate an average across benchmarks in Table 8. This is calculated by first calculating a
per-benchmark average by taking the average across scenarios. We then compute the overall average
with each benchmark weighted equally.
Additionally, for safety evaluation, we provide ToxiGen results broken down by group targeted in
Table9forallmodels,fromwhichwecanseesomegroupsarespeciallytargeted,evenafterinstruction

G Human Evaluation Details
G.1 Setup
Hereweprovidemoredetailsforthehumanevaluationdescribedin§4.3. Ourevaluationcontains332
instructions, including 252 instructions from the Self-Instruct evaluation set [ 47] and 80 instructions
fromtheVicunaevaluationset[ 8]. Ourevaluationisconductedforthreepairsofmodels: 1) TÜLU
65B vs ChatGPT, 2) TÜLU65B vsTÜLU7B, 3)TÜLU65B v.s. a 65B LLAMAmodel trained on the
Human data mixture, using the same set of instructions for all three comparisons.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we recruited 18 expert annotators, which are researchers at AI2 or
studentsatUW,fortheannotation. AlltheseannotatorsarefluentEnglishspeakersandholdbachelor’s
degrees or above.
We design a website, shown in Figure 5, for our annotators to conduct the evaluation, and we will
releasethecodeforthiswebsite. Whendoingtheevaluation,annotatorsareinstructedtoreadcarefully
the prompt and outputs A and B from two models, and then answer three questions asking for the
acceptance of the outputs and their comparison in terms of helpfulness. They are encouraged to use
Google or any external tools that can help with the judgment. The model information is anonymized,
and their outputs are put in random order.
Figure 5: The website interface for our human evaluation (see App. G for details). Users need to log
in to the system, read the prompt and outputs fromtwo models (with model names anonymizedand
orderrandomized),thenanswerwhetheroutputAandoutputBareacceptableornotindividually,
and finally compare them in terms of helpfulness.
G.2 Inter-Annotator Agreement
We measure the agreement of our annotators on a subset of 119 examples (63 instances randomly
sampledfromtheChatGPT3vs TÜLU65Bcomparison,and59instancesrandomlysampledfrom
theTÜLU65BvsTÜLU7Bcomparison). Weassigntwoannotatorsforeachoftheseexamplesand
compute their agreement for both the acceptance evaluation and pairwise comparison evaluation.

Theannotatorsachieve anagreementof0.84forwhetheramodeloutputshouldbeacceptedornot.
For the pairwise comparison, following Zhou et al. [56], we report a tie-discounted accuracy, which
assigns one point if both annotators agreed, half a point if either annotator (but not both) labeled a tie,
and zero point otherwise. We also merged “clearly better” and “slightly better” together, so our final
options will be simply comparing which of A and B is better, or a tie. Our annotators achieved an
agreement of 0.72 for this pairwise comparison.
Although these numbers show reasonable agreement, we also note that there is a large extent of
subjectivity in human evaluation. This noise level also indicates that some prior work [ 8,55] that
uses a small number of examples for human evaluation might not be reliable enough. We suggest
thatthecommunityneedstofurtherimprovethereliabilityandscalabilityofhumanevaluationfor
instruction-following models.
H Further Investigation of Figure 2
To furtherinvestigate the degreeto which thenumber ofunique tokens isbeing used byGPT-4 as a
markerofquality, wecreatedadummyevaluatorthatcomparestwomodeloutputs, andassignsawin
tothe outputwith moreuniquetokens. Weplotthe win-ratecalculated usingthisdummyevaluator
against the win-rate calculated using GPT-4 in Figure 6.
We find that while the dummy evaluator generally over-estimates the win-rate, the trend is still
strikingly linear. Wenote thatthe 𝑅2for thetrendline is.91, suggesting thatthe uniquetoken count
explains a large proportion of the variance in the win rates. Based on this, we believe that the number
of unique tokens is certainly a key preference that GPT-4 cares about in its evaluation, although it is
still not the only important feature.
