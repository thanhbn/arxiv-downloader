I've successfully translated the entire research paper from English to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact same structure, including:

- All sections and subsections 
- Tables with both headers and content translated
- Figure captions and descriptions
- Code examples and prompts in the appendix
- Mathematical notation and references
- Page numbering and formatting

The translation covers all 20 pages of the original document, preserving the academic tone and technical terminology while making it accessible in Vietnamese. Key technical terms are translated appropriately (e.g., "Chain of Thoughts" as "Chain of Thoughts", "Program of Thoughts" as "Program of Thoughts", etc.) while maintaining clarity for Vietnamese readers familiar with machine learning concepts.
