ABSTRACT
Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to solve varieties of
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including mathematical reasoning. In
this work, we present SkyMath, a large language model for mathematics with
13 billion parameters. By applying self-compare fine-tuning, we have enhanced
mathematical reasoning abilities of Skywork-13B-Base remarkably. On GSM8K,
SkyMath outperforms all known open-source models of similar size and has es-
tablished a new SOTA performance. On dataset MATH and out-of-domain dataset
CMath, SkyMath also achieves a high accuracy rate, showing remarkable gener-
alizability to varieties of math problems.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Nowadays, Large language models (LLMS) are increasingly being applied to all kinds of complex
tasks, including content creation (Gardner et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a; Zhu et al., 2023; Dai
et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a), code generation (Nijkamp et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023d; Fried et al.,
2023; Chen et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023b), multi-turn conversations (Thoppilan
et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023b; Bai et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023a; Zeng et al., 2023; Shu
et al., 2023), mathematical reasoning (Azerbayev et al., 2023; Yue et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023;
Luo et al., 2023a; Qiao et al., 2023; Chern et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023a), and knowledge-based
question answering (Cui et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023a; Zhu &
Wang, 2023), and they have the potential to revolutionize the fields of natural language processing
and natural language understanding (OpenAI, 2022, 2023). Moreover, compared to traditional AI
methods, LLMs gain unparalleled advantages in these landscapes. Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) fueled by LLMs is just around the corner.
Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs come with a series of challenges and issues. Math-
ematical reasoning is one of subfields worth exploring. In the context of evaluating the reason-
ing capabilities of LLMs, complex mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial benchmark. More-
over, mathematical reasoning tasks are considered to be one of the major gaps between closed-
source models like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) or GPT4 (OpenAI, 2023) and open-source models
like LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a,b). To achieve advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities,
numerous open-source models have made attempts: Kuaishou introduces the KwaiYiiMath by ap-
plying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforced Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and
constructed a small-scale Chinese primary school mathematics test set (named KMath) (Fu et al.,
2023a); Microsoft presentes wizardMath by applying their proposed Reinforcement Learning from
Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math (Luo et al., 2023a); Xiang et al. in-
troduce MAmmoTH by training the model on their self-developed dataset MathInstruct (Yue et al.,
2023); Zhangir et al. presente LLEMMA by continue pretraining Code Llama on Proof-Pile-2, a
mixture of scientific papers, web data containing mathematics, and mathematical code (Azerbayev
et al., 2023); Yu et al. (Yu et al., 2023) proposes MetaMath trained on a new dataset called Meta-
MathQA which is build by bootstrapping mathematical questions by rewriting the question from
multiple perspectives. Despite the great success, most existing open-source LLMs are still far away
from satisfactory for solving mathematical problems due to the complex reasoning procedures, and
preform poorly on GSM8K and MATH when compared to open-sourced models.

--- PAGE 2 ---
To bridge this gap, we propose SkyMath, a finetuned language model that specializes in mathe-
matical reasoning, by applying our improved data augmentation techniques and SFT process to the
finetuning of Skywork-13B-Base. The main process consists of three parts, as follows: 1. Fine-
tuning the Skywork-13B-Base model on open-source datasets; 2. Constructing a new dataset for
math by improved data augmentation techniques; 3. Reconstructing math dataset by applying our
proposed self-check techniques. Experimental results show that SkyMath outperforms many open-
source models in similar sizes on two mathematical benchmarks, namly GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021)
and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021).
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of related work including LLMs
and LLMs for mathematics. Section 3 introduces the methodology of Skywork-13B-Math including
sample construction methods and process of supervised fine-tuning . Then, the experimental vali-
dations and comparisons are made in Section 4 and Section 5. The conclusion is drawn in Section
6.
2 R ELATED WORK
Large Language Models Recently, LLMs have achieved substantial progress in natural language
processing tasks, benefiting from high-quality, diverse textual data, and enormous model parame-
ter counts. Researchers have found that LLMs perform better on downstream tasks (Kaplan et al.,
2020). LLMs, which pretrained on extensive textual data and fine-tuned for specific tasks, demon-
strate remarkable capabilities in numerous natural language processing tasks compared to smaller
models (Devlin et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2022b). The significant capabilities of large models mainly
lie in three aspects: 1. In-context learning. 2. Instruction following. 3. Step-by-step reasoning
(Zhao et al., 2023). The GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a language model that has tens of billions
parameter counts, exhibits significant performance improvements in few-shot, one-shot, and zero-
shot learning tasks through in-context learning. However, the effectiveness of in-context learning
capability depends on different downstream tasks. The open-source model Llama2 (Touvron et al.,
2023b), with a pre-trained context length of up to 4k, demonstrates robust contextual understanding
in tasks such as summarization, multi-turn dialogues, and reading comprehension. LLMs handle
different downstream tasks efficiently, but sometimes these pre-trained models still struggle to com-
prehend human instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022). It is highly challenging for LLMs to understand
and follow specific instructions in the complex natural language tasks. To overcome the challenge,
Instruction Tuning (IT) (Zhang et al., 2023b) and Chain of Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022c) have
been proposed. Specifically, IT aims to utilize the constructed pairs whose formats are [instruction,
output] to fine-tune the pre-trained language model. Moreover, the adoption of multitask instruction
blending in fine-tuning has demonstrated the effectiveness of IT techniques in unseen tasks (Sanh
et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a). Numerous studies show that high-quality, di-
verse instructions can effectively improve the performance of LLMs in natural language tasks (Wang
et al., 2023c; Zhou et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022a; Cao et al., 2023). CoT is a method that aims to
improve the performance of LLMs by providing detailed reasoning processes as training inputs. By
enabling the model to follow a step-by-step process, CoT helps LLMs to break down complex prob-
lems into smaller ones and accumulate small victories to achieve greater success (Wei et al., 2022c).
This approach has led to significant improvements in the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially
in mathematical reasoning and decision-making tasks. The success of CoT and IT technologies in
Self-Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has opened up new possibilities for enhancing the performance
of LLMs. Numerous models, including InstructonGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), BLOOMZ (Muen-
nighoff et al., 2023), WizardLM (Xu et al., 2023), ChatGLM2 (Du et al., 2022), and Vicuna (Chiang
et al., 2023), have acquired powerful reasoning abilities, allowing them to perform complex tasks
with remarkable accuracy. In addition, by training LLMs on data specific to a particular domain,
such as medical or legal, it is possible to obtain models that excel in that domain. Models obtained
in this way include InstructDial (Gupta et al., 2022), Radiology-GPT (Liu et al., 2023b), Goat (Liu
& Low, 2023), WizardCoder (Luo et al., 2023b).
Large Language Models for Mathematical reasoning Mathematical reasoning is one of the es-
sential abilities required for LLMs. To enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities of base LLMs,
a group of researchers conducted a comprehensive study. Based on CoT, a series of works are car-
ried out to optimize the reasoning paths (Wang et al., 2023b; Fu et al., 2023b; Huang et al., 2022).
2

--- PAGE 3 ---
Wang et al. introduces Self-Consistency, employing the results of multiple reasoning paths to en-
hance the accuracy of inference through consistent answers (Wang et al., 2023b). Fu et al. proposes
Complexity-based CoT, achieving improved performance in mathematical reasoning tasks through
a CoT involving multiple complex reasoning steps (Fu et al., 2023b). In terms of prompting engi-
neering, Zheng et al. combines CoT to generate answers, utilizing the answer from the previous step
as a prompt for the next step, gradually guiding LLMs to generate correct answers (Zheng et al.,
2023a). Luo et al. proposes reinforced evol-instruct, a method that combines evol-instruct with
reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs (Luo et al., 2023a). Madaan
et al. introduces Self-Refine, which a single LLM serves simultaneously as a generator, refiner, and
feedback provider, iteratively refining itself to enhance its capabilities in mathematical reasoning
(Madaan et al., 2023). Yu et al. constructs a new dataset, MetaMathQA, through data augmen-
tation of rewriting of mathematical problems from multiple perspectives (Yu et al., 2023). Fu et
al. enhances the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) (Fu et al., 2023a). Based on
Cot and Program of Thoughts (PoT) (Chen et al., 2022), Yue et al. constructs a new dataset namly
MathInstruct and uses it in SFT. PoT utilizes an external interpreter (e.g., Python interpreter) to
compute answers for complex mathematical problems (Yue et al., 2023). Azerbayev et al. continues
pretraining on Proof-Pile-2, a dataset containing mathematical web data and mathematical code, and
uses PoT to obtain an accurate answer (Azerbayev et al., 2023).
3 M ETHOD
In this section, we introduce SkyMath in detail. As shown in Figure 1, our method mainly contains
two steps:
1. Instruction boosting.
2. Self-compare fine-tuning.
Figure 1: The Overview Architecture of SkyMath
3.1 I NSTRUCTION BOOSTING
Previous work has shown math instructions with various complexities could make remarkable effect
on math LLMs training (Luo et al., 2023a). Therefore, the first step we do is constructing a dataset
of both high quality and diversity.
1. We first collect a math dataset from different sources, including different levels, in both Chinese
3

--- PAGE 4 ---
and English.
2. Then inspired by WizardLM (Xu et al., 2023) and MetaMath (Yu et al., 2023), we adapt instruc-
tion boosting, namely 1) concretizing, 2) adding constraints, 3) deepening and 4) rephrasing, to the
question augmentation process.
3. We use LLMs to generate responses for augmented questions.
4. Correctness check.
By now, we have got a dataset of high complexity.
3.2 S ELF-COMPARE FINE-TUNING
Progressive-Hint Prompting (PHP) (Zheng et al., 2023a) enables multiple interactions between users
and LLMs by using previously generated answers as hints to progressively guide LLMs toward the
correct answers. Inspired by this, we believe introducing previous answers to the training process
also has an effect. We hope the model can compare its previous answers with ground truth and
correct its specific errors through training.
Figure 2: Self-compare Fine-tuning
As shown in Figure 2, self-compare fine-tuning contains four steps:
1. For each question, ask the LLM to give an answer.
2. 2. Construct self-compare prompts, as shown in Figure 3.
3. Combine the data with the origin dataset.
4. Fine-tuning.
Like human beings, we believe LLMs tend to make different mistakes as their abilities improve.
Therefore, in practice we divide the origin dataset into several sub-datasets thus we can repeat self-
compare fine-tuning more than once.
4 E XPERIMENTS
4.1 E VALUATION BENCHMARKS
We mainly evaluate SkyMath on two popular mathematical reasoning benchmarks: GSM8k (Cobbe
et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021). In order to see the performance of SkyMath on
the out-of-domain dataset and in chinese, we also evaluate our model on CMath (Wei et al., 2023),
for completeness.

--- PAGE 5 ---
Figure 3: Self-compare Prompts
GSM8k contains 7,473 training data and 1,319 test data, mainly on grade school level English math
problems. Each problem takes between 2 and 8 steps to solve, and solutions primarily involve
performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations.
MATH is much more challenging. It contains 7,500 training data and 5,000 test data, spans seven
subjects including Prealgebra, Algebra, Number Theory, Counting and Probability, Geometry, In-
termediate Algebra, and Precalculus.
CMath is a Chinese Elementary School Math Word Problems (CMATH) dataset, which contains
1.7k elementary school-level math word problems with detailed annotations, sourced from actual
Chinese workbooks and exams. We use it as an out-of-domain dataset.
4.2 M ODEL AND BASELINES
We use SkyWork-13B as base model and correspondingly choose models of the same size and has
already been open source for comparison. Therefore we choose LLaMA1 (Touvron et al., 2023a),
LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023a), BaiChuan1 (Yang et al., 2023a), BaiChuan2 (Yang et al., 2023a),
WizardMath (Luo et al., 2023a), GAIRMath-Abel (Chern et al., 2023), and MetaMath (Yu et al.,
2023) as baselines.

--- PAGE 6 ---
Evaluating results are shown in Table 1. SkyMath outperforms all baselines on GSM8K, thus we
have established a new SOTA performance across open-source LLMs of similar size. On the MATH
dataset, which is highly challenging, SkyMath also achieves a high accuracy rate. Meanwhile, on
the out-of-domain dataset CMath, SkyMathâ€™s performance shows remarkable generalizability to
both unseen math problems and Chinese math problems.
6 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper introduces SkyMath, a mathematics model fine-tuned with self-compare. Evaluating re-
sults show SkyMath achieves SOTA performance across all existing open-source LLMs of similar
size on GSM8K and shows remarkable generalizability to out-of-domain math problems. Consider-
ing we didnâ€™t use tools or reward models, the result is even more difficult.
Future Work. Although our model achieves impressive performance on GSM8K, we still fall far
behind models like GPT-4. In the future, we will explore more methods to improve the abilities of
our model.
