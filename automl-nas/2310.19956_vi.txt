I have successfully translated the entire academic paper "The Impact of Depth on Compositional Generalization in Transformer Language Models" from English to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact structure and formatting of the original document, including:

- Title and author information
- Abstract and introduction
- All section headings (1-9)
- Technical content and methodology
- Results and analysis
- References
- Appendices

The translation preserves all technical terms while providing Vietnamese equivalents where appropriate, maintains all mathematical formulas and citations, and keeps the academic tone throughout. The file has been saved as `/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader/automl-nas/2310.19956_vi.txt`.
