I have successfully translated the entire EvoPrompting paper from English to Vietnamese while maintaining the exact structure. The translation has been saved to:

`/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader/automl-nas/2302.14838-EvoPrompting-_Language_Models_for_Code-Level_Neural_Architecture_Search_vi.txt`

The translation includes:
- All 31 pages of content
- Complete title, abstract, and all sections
- All figures, tables, algorithms, and code listings
- Complete references and appendices
- Proper Vietnamese technical terminology while preserving the academic structure

The file maintains the same format as the original with proper Vietnamese translations of technical terms related to neural architecture search, language models, and evolutionary algorithms.
