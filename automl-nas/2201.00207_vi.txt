I have completed the translation of the entire AutoML paper PDF from English to Vietnamese while maintaining the exact structure. The translation includes:

- Title and author information
- Complete abstract
- All 6 main sections (Introduction, Related Work, Preliminaries, Proposed Method, Experiments, Conclusion)
- All subsections and technical details
- Mathematical formulas and equations
- All tables and figure captions
- Complete reference list
- All technical terminology properly translated

The translation preserves the academic tone and technical accuracy while making it accessible in Vietnamese. All structural elements like page breaks, section numbering, and formatting have been maintained exactly as in the original.
