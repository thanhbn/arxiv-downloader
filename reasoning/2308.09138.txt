Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable fluency
and competence across various natural language tasks. How-
ever, recent research has highlighted their sensitivity to varia-
tions in input prompts. To deploy LLMs in a safe and reliable
manner, it is crucial for their outputs to be consistent when
prompted with expressions that carry the same meaning or
intent. While some existing work has explored how state-of-
the-art LLMs address this issue, their evaluations have been
confined to assessing lexical equality of single- or multi-word
answers, overlooking the consistency of generative text se-
quences. For a more comprehensive understanding of the con-
sistency of LLMs in open-ended text generation scenarios, we
introduce a general measure of semantic consistency, and for-
mulate multiple versions of this metric to evaluate the perfor-
mance of various LLMs. Our proposal demonstrates signif-
icantly higher consistency and stronger correlation with hu-
man evaluations of output consistency than traditional met-
rics based on lexical consistency. Finally, we propose a novel
prompting strategy, called Ask-to-Choose (A2C), to enhance
semantic consistency. When evaluated for closed-book ques-
tion answering based on answer variations from the Truth-
fulQA benchmark, A2C increases accuracy metrics for pre-
trained and finetuned LLMs by up to 47%, and semantic con-
sistency metrics for instruction-tuned models by up to 7-fold.
Introduction
In recent times, the adoption of large pretrained language
models (LLMs) in next-generation automated workflows for
natural language-based tasks has been on the rise. How-
ever, this increased usage has also brought concerns about
the safety and reliability of these models into the limelight
(Weidinger et al. 2022; Gupta et al. 2023). In the context
of Natural Language Generation (NLG), it is essential to
have a dependable LLM that produces semantically equiv-
alent outputs when given semantically equivalent prompts.
This property is known as consistency . Consistency is crit-
ical to guarantee the safety of LLMs, since it increases the
certainty that an LLM can produce similar enough outputs
when fed with semantically similar inputs. However, the ex-
tent to which current NLG approaches exhibit consistency
and the methods to measure this consistency remains insuffi-
cient. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for
evaluating and ensuring the consistency of NLG. Our frame-
work generalizes previous approaches that evaluated consis-tency based on single- ot multi-token outputs, such as Elazar
et al. (2021), to encompass entire generated text sequences.
Our measure of consistency for NLG surpasses simple
lexical measures proposed in prior studies, and captures gen-
uine variations in prompts that convey the same semantic
meaning but differ in their lexical representation. We em-
pirically assess the effectiveness of this metric in evaluat-
ing consistency, considering various measures of semantic
equivalence, LLM architectures, as well as paraphrasing and
answer generation/decoding techniques.
We consider a closed book question-answering scenario
where we want to ensure that the answers generated from an
LLM in response to paraphrased versions of a question are
semantically similar. To this end, we utilize in-context learn-
ing strategies—i.e. eliciting answers from a LLM using few-
shot examples in a prompt template—in a number of ways.
Advanced prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought
reasoning (Wei et al. 2023), are widely known to extract
improved performance from LLMs, as well as help reduce
harmful bias (Guo, Yang, and Abbasi 2022) and improve
factuality (Si et al. 2023). Our findings show that prompting
strategies can also be useful to ensure consistency in real-
istic paraphrasing situations. We illustrate the specifics of
our strategy in Fig. 1. To generate answers to paraphrased
versions of a question, we start with the prompt template
paraphrasePrompt that contains examples of different
ways to paraphrase (such as using synonyms or changing
syntax). We then iteratively feed the indicators of each of
these methods, along with an input question into an auxil-
iary LLM ( AuxLLM ) to generate paraphrases of that ques-
tion. These questions are fed into the main LLM, generat-
ing descriptive answers. Each descriptive answer, along with
the original question, is added into a second prompt tem-
plate ( answerPrompt ), and fed into LLM again to elicit
short one or two word answers. The inclusion of few-shot
examples of question-long answer-short answer combina-
tions within the answerPrompt aid in this process. Once
we have multiple short answers to the original question, we
add each pair of answers, plus the original question, into
AuxLLM again to obtain pairwise semantic equivalence of
these two answers.
Our proposed semantic consistency metric takes as input
all pairwise semantic equivalences, and calculates overall
consistency between all variations of answers to the origi-arXiv:2308.09138v2  [cs.CL]  29 Apr 2025

nal question. We experiment with different versions of this
consistency metric based on notions of semantic equivalence
found in the literature. In empirical comparisons with ex-
isting notions of token-based similarity metrics, we show
that our proposed metric demonstrates higher degrees of
consistency among answer variations. Most importantly, we
demonstrate that our notion of semantic consistency aligns
very closely with human preferences for consistency.
Our main findings are as follows.
• Larger LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of consistency.
• As the size of LLMs increases, their generated answers
tend to be less accurate, illustrating an inverse scaling
phenomenon (as also observed in Lin, Hilton, and Evans
(2022)).
• Notably, consistency and accuracy are independent prop-
erties and do not appear to be correlated.
• By carefully designing input prompts and the novel con-
sistency metric, it is possible to align semantic consistency
measurements with human notions of consistency.
• We propose a prompting strategy Ask-to-Choose (A2C),
which enhances accuracy and semantic consistency
on generated answer variations from TruthfulQA (Lin,
Hilton, and Evans 2022), with accuracy improvements
upto 47% across the board, and consistency improvements
for instruction-tuned models by as much as 7-fold.
Related Work
The concept of consistency measurement was first intro-
duced in the LAMA probe to understand LLMs as knowl-
edge bases (Petroni et al. 2019). Building on this idea, Elazar
et al. (2021) developed the ParaRel dataset to assess the con-
sistency of masked language models by studying the tokens
they would predict for masked tuples. Expanding this line of
research, Fierro and Søgaard (2022) extended the methods
to a multilingual, multi-token setting, and Keleg and Magdy
(2023) plugged the deficiencies of LAMA by developing
a culturally diverse factual benchmark dataset. Addition-
ally, Jang, Kwon, and Lukasiewicz (2021) proposed a novel
framework for understanding consistency in fine-tuned mod-
els for sentence similarity tasks. Zhou et al. (2022) devisedan approach that employs multiple prompts to specify single
tasks, resulting in a more than 10% improvement in consis-
tency metrics across diverse data and task settings. Finally,
Newman, Choubey, and Rajani (2022) and Tam et al. (2022)
developed robust methods to accurately extract factual infor-
mation from LLMs.
Given an input to a LLM, choosing between multiple can-
didate outputs is a popular strategy to ensure accuracy and
consistency of the final output. Among others, the Chain-
of-Thoughts approach (Wei et al. 2023, CoT) uses major-
ity voting to ensure high accuracy of generated answers.
Kassner et al. (2021) used an external solver—aided with
hardcoded logical constraints to rerank answers from a pre-
trained LLM while maximizing accuracy and belief con-
sistency. Mitchell et al. (2022) took a similar approach,
but used dynamically estimated constraints and an auxiliary
LLM to do the reranking. Finally, the self-consistency de-
coding strategy uses sampling and majority voting instead
of greedy decoding to improve accuracy of CoT prompting
(Wang et al. 2022; Aggarwal et al. 2023). In comparison
to these past works, our proposed A2C prompting strategy
to ensure semantic consistency uses a prompt that asks the
LLM itself to choose the best answer from among the can-
didates generated by querying it multiple times under varied
experimental conditions. This can be seen as a way of ro-
bustifying approaches based on majority voting through the
addition of a reasoning layer after sampling or equivalent
steps that generate multiple output candidates.
We conclude by mentioning our previous work that mo-
tivates this paper. In Raj, Rosati, and Majumdar (2022), we
proposed a semantic consistency metric, and demonstrated
its advantages over token-based consistency measurement
for a number of pretrained language models. In this paper,
we significantly generalize the measurement framework be-
yond pairwise similarity, use in-context learning for para-
phrase and output generation, and perform empirical eval-
uation on LLMs that are finetuned on instructions or with
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
Most importantly, we propose the A2C technique that sig-
nificantly improves accuracy and consistency of output vari-
ations. Note that while Raj, Rosati, and Majumdar (2022)

--- PAGE 3 ---
used three pretrained LLMs followed by a two-step filter-
ing process to generate paraphrased questions, the obtained
paraphrases were not diverse enough. To improve this sit-
uation, we now use in-context learning to make the para-
phrasing step significantly efficient while introducing more
diversity among paraphrased questions.
Methods
Consistency in LLMs refers to the expectation that similar
prompts (such as paraphrases of each other) should generate
similar outputs. This notion was first formalized by Elazar
et al. (2021). Consider nsemantically similar prompts X=
{x1, . . . , x n}that generate outputs from an output space Y:
Y={y1, . . . , y n}, yi∈ Y when passed through a LLM.
Given this, Elazar et al. (2021) defined consistency as
Cons lex(Y) =1
n(n−1)nX
i,j=1,i̸=jI(yi=yj). (1)
The above definition, as well as follow-up studies leveraging
it (Fierro and Søgaard 2022; Jiang et al. 2020; Zhou et al.
2022; Newman, Choubey, and Rajani 2022) are restricted in
their lexical notion of consistency. An important caveat of
this notion of consistency is that it only looks for matching
tokens in the outputs. However, in the real world, the same
idea can often be expressed with completely different words.
For example, two outputs I love cats andfelines are my fa-
vorite are relatively consistent, but they would have a low
consistency score under this metric. Thus, it is not possible
to use this same measure to evaluate natural language out-
puts from language models in diverse situations.
Semantic Consistency
We propose a general measure of semantic consistency that
substantially broadens the definition of Eq. (1) by substitut-
ing the lexical equality and simple average in Eq. (1) with
more sophisticated functions that encompass semantic align-
ment across multiple outputs.
Cons sem(Y) =1
nnX
i=1S(yi, Y−i). (2)
where S(·,·)measures the extent of semantic simi-
larity between each generated output yiwith the rest
of the generated outputs, denoted by the set Y−i=
{1, . . . , y i−1, yi+1, . . . , y n}. Note that the consistency mea-
sure of Elazar et al. (2021) is a special case of Eq. (2), taking
S(yi, Y−i) = (n−1)−1P
j̸=iI(yj=yi).
In this paper, we experiment with two broad techniques of
calculating S(yi, Y−i). The first method is based on pairwise
similarity. We simply replace the token equality indicator in
Eq. (1) with a semantic equivalence function.
S(yi, Y−i) =1
n−1nX
j=1,i̸=js(yi, yj). (3)
We can easily recover the original metric of Elazar et al.
(2021) by setting the token equality indicator as s(·,·), i.e.s(yi, yj)≡I(yi=yj). In our experiments, as the function
s(·,·)we use existing measures of semantic similarity, such
as entailment and contradiction (Wang et al. 2018).
Our second instantiation of the semantic consistency met-
ric in Eq. (2) is based on a more implicit notion of con-
sistency that utilizes similarity beyond pairwise compari-
son: semantic clustering entropy. We first obtain pairwise
semantic equivalence measures through in-context learn-
ing on an auxiliary LLM (Flan-T5-XL), using the prompts
answerPrompt andsimilarPrompt (see Listings 3
and 4 in Appendix for the templates). We then use these pair-
wise scores to cluster the noutputs into k≤nsemantically
similar clusters, say C={Ci, . . . , C k}. Finally, we define
the consistency of the LLM as the semantic entropy (SE) of
these clusters.
SE=−kX
i=1|Ck|
n
log2|Ci|
n
. (4)
Eq. (4) adapts the information-theoretic definition of entropy
over the discrete probability distribution where an element
fromYis assigned to cluster Ckwith probability |Ck|/n.
Rearranging the terms in Eq. (4) with the definition in Eq. (2)
in mind, we have as semantic equivalence function the fol-
lowing:
S(yi, Y−i) =−KX
k=1(yi∈Ck)
|Ck|log2|Ci|
n
.
Kuhn, Gal, and Farquhar (2023) utilized semantic clus-
tering to determine the uncertainty in generations from
a LLM, using a entailment-contradiction model as s(·,·)
to calculate the similarity score in both directions (i.e.
s(a, b)ands (b, a)). In comparison, our purpose was to cal-
culate the consistency not similarity so the prompts are de-
signed in such manner. Consistency can be considered as a
subdomain of similarity, with special emphasis on factual
alignment between sentences.
Sources of Variation
To implement the semantic consistency measures outlined
above, we first generate multiple paraphrases of a given
prompt. These paraphrased prompts are input to the LLM to
generate the outputs Y. We consider two different strategies
for this process:
In-context Paraphrasing and Nucleus Sampling Real-
istic paraphrases are not completely random perturbations
of the original phrase. Rather they follow specific patterns,
such as the use of synonyms, or a change in the sentence
structure. To reflect the above, we use an in-context learn-
ing strategy to generate paraphrases. We simply prompt an
auxiliary LLM (text-davinci-003 (Brown et al. 2020)) with
few-shot examples of paraphrasing contexts (denoted by
questionPrompt in Fig. 1, see also Listing 2 in Ap-
pendix) to generate paraphrases that align to one of the con-
text examples. We use Nucleus sampling to generate an-
swers from these paraphrased questions.

--- PAGE 4 ---
Figure 2: Examples of the two methods of paraphrasing and answer generation.
Cross-temperature Nucleus Sampling In this strategy,
we keep the input prompt same, and simply generate an-
swers across a wide range of temperatures to construct the
set of outputs Y, using nucleus sampling for decoding.
As a concrete example, we look at Fig. 2. In the first
method, the original question What happens to you if you eat
watermelon seeds? when passed through the auxiliary LLM
obtains four paraphrased questions, which are fed into the
main LLM to obtain four answers to the original question.
In comparison, in the second method the original question
is fed into the main LLM at four different temperatures to
generate another set of answers.
Improving Consistency by Asking to Choose
Pretrained language models show marked improvements
in complex task-specific performances when they are fine-
tuned on a range of relevant instructions, and/or using
RLHF (Lambart et al. 2023). Instruction finetuning allows
the LLM to follow specific instructions that can be supplied
as prompt templates, while the reward model in RLHF trains
the model to rank multiple answer candidates driven by hu-
man preference. Motivated by this observation, we hypoth-
esize that if a LLM is supplied with multiple output candi-
dates as answers to a paraphrased question and if properly
instructed to do so, it is likely to pick an answer consistent
with the answer to the original question.
Given the above intuition, we propose Ask-to-Choose
(A2C), a multiple-choice prompting strategy to improve
paraphrasing consistency. At a high level, we start with
sets of output variations across paraphrasing contexts C=
{c1, . . . , c I}and temperatures T={t1, . . . , t J}. Denote
these outputs by YcandYt, respectively. We then leverage
in-context learning once more to select two sets of best an-
swers, querying LLM multiple times with in-context para-
phrases of the input question and either YcorYtusing the
template in Listing 1.
We present the details of the above process in Algo-
rithm 1. As we see in the next section, A2C increases ac-
curacy of LLMs across the board by up to 47%, and the con-
sistency of outputs from instruction-finetuned models by as
much as 705%.Algorithm 1: The Ask to Choose Method

Experiments
Setup
Data To evaluate semantic consistency, we use answers
generated on questions from the TruthfulQA benchmark
dataset (Lin, Hilton, and Evans 2022), using the two varia-
tions mentioned above. We chose TruthfulQA as it is widely
used in the literature for benchmarking, and already has a
series of metrics and baselines for evaluating freeform text
generation. For contextual paraphrasing, we start with the
paraphrasePrompt template with examples of four lin-
guistic rules: synonyms, changing word forms, changing the

structure of a sentence, and changing conjunctions (see List-
ing 2 in Appendix). We feed this template and each ques-
tion in TruthfulQA into the auxiliary LLM (OpenAI 2023,
text-davinci-003) to generate a paraphrase according to one
of the four paraphrasing rules. Iterating over all rules gives
us four contextual paraphrases for each original question in
TruthfulQA.
Models We use a number of LLMs, pretrained using dif-
ferent strategies, for consistency evaluation. Firstly, we use
a series of OPT models (Zhang et al. 2022) with increas-
ing number of parameters (from 125M to 6.7B param-
eters) to understand the effects of model parameter size
on consistency. For comparison across model architectures
and finetuning strategies, we use the instruction-finetuned
Flan T5 XL (Chung et al. 2022), the RLHF-finetuned mod-
els StableVicuna-13B1and LlaMA 2 13B (Touvron et al.
2023), as well as GPT-3 text-davinci-003 that uses RLHF
and instruction finetuning.
Evaluation For implementing the pairwise similarity-
based semantic consistency in Eq. (3), we use four measures
of semantic equivalence as s(·,·):
1. Pairwise semantic equivalence using paraphrase detec-
tion (PP, details in Appendix A),
2. Pairwise agreement or entailment (Entail), and
3. Pairwise disagreement or contradiction (Contra), both us-
ing a natural language inference model (DeBERTa v2
xxlarge finetuned on MNLI) (Wang et al. 2018),
4. Semantic cluster entropy (Eq. 4).
We also implement two heuristic measures of token overlap:
ROUGE1 (R1-C) and named-entity overlap (NER). Besides
consistency, we use ROUGE1 (R1-A) and BLEURT (Sel-
lam, Das, and Parikh 2020) to measure whether the para-
phrased answers are indeed accurate answers to the original
question. For Contra and Entropy, smaller values indicate
high degree of consistency, while higher values of the rest
correspond to high consistency.
Human Preference Elicitation To assess the reliability of
our semantic consistency measurement and chosen agree-
ment functions, we conduct a human study involving three
volunteer participants who label a random selection of 100
questions with answer pairs resulting from paraphrases of
these questions. Participants are instructed to label answer
pairs as consistent if they consider the two answers as se-
mantically equivalent and inconsistent otherwise. We mea-

ment with our evaluation metrics using linear correlation
(Spearman’s ρ).
Results
Figure 3 outlines a number of key findings for consis-
tency and accuracy measurements without applying A2C.
First , as OPT models get larger in parameter size they tend
to do worse at providing truthful answers in TruthfulQA
(Lin, Hilton, and Evans 2022), as measured by R1-A and
BLEURT. Surprisingly, this trend reverses for larger mod-
els, for whom the accuracy metrics return to comparable
levels to OPT-125M. Second , models with higher parame-
ter size tend to be more consistent, especially for contextual
paraphrasing. Third , Lexical measures of consistency (R1-
C, NER) are less informative measures of consistency than
versions of our proposed semantic consistency metric.
Interplay of Consistency and Accuracy Table 1 presents
consistency comparisons based on the PP method, covering
all answers, vs. only accurate answers. While consistency
does increase with model parameter size for both sets of an-
swers, observations are interesting for consistencies of all
answers vs. correct answers for the same model. For smaller
models, semantic consistency tends to be the same or de-
creases slightly when only accurate answers are considered
for consistency calculation.
Alignment to Human Preference Human annotations
done on generated answer variations have a Fleiss κvalue
of0.9, indicating high inter-annotator agreement. Fig. 4 pro-
vides the pairwise correlation matrix between our evaluation
metrics and human scores. Interestingly, accuracy metrics
do not correlate much with either consistency measures or
human annotations of consistency. The two accuracy mea-
sures show moderate positive correlation with one another
(ρ= 0.41). Consistency measures tend to not correlate with
one another, except in the case of Entropy, PP, and entail-
ment, which are highly correlated. Entropy shows strong
correlation with human annotations, followed by entailment,
PP (ρ= 0.83,0.73,0.55, respectively). In comparison, lexi-
cal measures of consistency show much weaker correlation:
NER ( ρ=0.14) and R1-C ( ρ=0.26). These observations in-
dicate that our proposed methodology does indeed measure

the property of consistency as understood by humans, and
do a better job than lexical measures that are based solely on
token similarity.
Improvements with the use of A2C Table 2 shows the
comparison of accuracy and consistency metrics in output
variations obtained without or with the help of A2C. For
brevity, we show results for 5 out of 8 models, and 3 out
of 6 consistency metrics (See Appendix C for full results).
After using A2C, we see a marked increase in accuracy of
most models across both our metrics—the maximum being
47% (StableVicuna-13B on BLEURT). For consistency, we
see improvements in both instruction-tuned models (Flan T5XL and text-davinci-003), but none of the OPT models and
those finetuned using RLHF only. We see the highest im-
provement in Flan-T5 XL, whose R1-C score increases by
more than 7-fold (4 to 32.2).
Earlier results on output variations without A2C showed
that consistency and accuracy do not always go together
(Fig. 3 and Table 1). With the application of A2C, this dif-
ference is reconciled to an extent. As seen in Table 3, the
output variations obtained after applying Algorithm 1, when
filtered for accurate answers, have similar or increased con-
sistency as per the PP metric across models and methods of
variation (context or temperature).
Pairwise correlations with human scores largely remain
the same after applying A2C. We see the largest movement
in the correlation between the two accuracy metrics—R1A
and BLEURT—which increases from 0.41 to 0.54. Among
semantic consistency metrics, Entropy shows slight increase
in correlations with other metrics (Table 4).
Discussion Given the above results, we recommend en-
tropy, entailment, and paraphrase-based agreement func-
tions as dependable measures of semantic consistency. Lex-
ical approaches are not faithful yardsticks of semantic con-
sistency, and do not correlate with human judgement. Many
of our findings are intuitive or in line with previous results.
For example, Lin, Hilton, and Evans (2022) found similar

had shown that pretrained models have poor understand-
ing of prompts, and prompts are better understood by larger
models. This is in line with our finding that larger models
are more consistent, and those finetuned to follow instruc-
tions are more so.
Less intuitive is the fact that consistency and accuracy do

not correlate. Both accuracy and consistency are desirable
properties of trustworthy NLG and both would reflect under-
standing of their prompts. Yet, since there doesn’t appear to
be a strong relationship between accuracy and consistency,
simply measuring accuracy is not enough to guarantee re-
liable LLMs. Given that the A2C method shows evidence
of improvement in consistency on accurate answers, simi-
lar prompting strategies may be explored to further improve
alignment of consistency and accuracy.
We also hypothesize that for A2C to increase consis-
tency, the LLM should be able to follow instructions in the
rankPrompt template specifically. As empirical evidence,
we look at the answers to the question What is the spici-
est part of a chili pepper? generated by Llama 2-13B and
text-davinci-003. Per TruthfulQA, the correct answer is The
spiciest part of a chili pepper is the placenta . This is accu-
rately reflected by the answer from the RLHF + instruction
finetuned text-davinci-003 when supplied with other answer
options using A2C: Option 3: The hottest section of a chili
pepper is the placenta, which contains the highest concen-
tration of capsaicin . However, the RLHF finetuned Llama
2-13B generates an incorrect answer that is not in the right
format: Capsaicinoids are a group of chemicals that are re-
sponsible for the pungency of hot peper. They are found in
different concentrations in various pepr varieties. Capsaci-Metric Before After

Conclusion
In this work, we presented a novel framework for evaluating
consistency of NLG that correlates well with human judge-
ments. We also introduced the A2C prompting strategy to
improve semantic conssitency. On TruthfulQA, A2C boosts
the accuracy of pretrained and fine-tuned language models
by as much as 47%, and the semantic consistency metrics
for instruction-tuned models by up to seven times. A key ad-
vantage of this generalization is sequential composition : if
we have access to semantic equivalence agreement functions
across diverse domains such as text, image, and audio gener-
ation, then we can use the same framework to evaluate con-
sistency across multimodal generative tasks as well. Future
work along similar lines should validate our proposed frame-
work across other types of text generation tasks such as chat
or table-to-text generation, and other benchmark datasets be-
yond TruthfulQA.
A key limitation of our work is that any error in the agree-
ment function will be reflected as error in the consistency
score. In addition, the inference cost for the current method
(six LLM calls per question) may prove to be too high in cer-
tain application scenarios, and should be investigated further
to develop more efficient prompting strategies.

Paraphrasing Details
To generate candidates for non-contextual paraphrasing, we
finetuned a DeBERTa v3 (He, Gao, and Chen 2021) large
model on PAWS (Zhang, Baldridge, and He 2019) para-
phrase dataset for paraphrase detection and used a thresh-
old on 0.8 probablility to indicate whether we keep a para-
phrase during question filtering. We also used this model as
our paraphrase detector for consistency measurement. The
model was trained for 3 epochs with an AdamW optimizer
with a weight decay of 0.01, warmup steps of 50, batch size
of 8, and learning rate of 6e-6.
Listing 2 contains the paraphrasePrompt prompt
template for contextual paraphrasing.
Consistency Calculation
To implement the paraphrasing-based semantic equivalence
method (PP in the main paper), we finetune a DeBERTa v3
(He, Gao, and Chen 2021) large model on the PAWS (Zhang,
Baldridge, and He 2019) paraphrase dataset for paraphrase
detection, then used a threshold on 0.8 probablility to indi-
cate whether two answers are paraphrases of each other. The
model was trained for 3 epochs with an AdamW optimizer
with a weight decay of 0.01, warmup steps of 50, batch size
of 8, and learning rate of 6e-6. To implement the entailment
and contradiction measures, we use a pretrained DeBERTa
base model (He et al. 2020) trained on MNLI (Williams,
Nangia, and Bowman 2017) to determine whether two an-
swers are predicted as of similar meaning or contradictory
to each other, respectively.
The prompt templates used in entropy-based semantic cal-
culation are given in listings 3 and 4.Additional Experimental Results
Table 5 contains the full set of results—covering all met-
rics and models—for accuracy and consistency measure-
ment comparisons before and after A2C.

Listing 2: The paraphraseprompt Template for In-context Paraphrasing
Today I want you to learn the ways of paraphrasing a sentence. Below are few methods with
examples. Go through them carefully.
1. Use synonyms
Sentence: Can you explain the attempts made by the research to discover reasons for this
phenomenon?
Paraphrase: Can you clarify the efforts undertaken by the research to unearth the causes
behind this phenomenon?
2. Change word forms (parts of speech)
Sentence: How did the teacher assist the students in registering for the course?
Paraphrase: In what manner did the teacher support the students in completing the course
registration?
3. Change the structure of a sentence
Sentence: Which of the discussed spectroscopic methods is the most recently developed
technique?
Paraphrase: Among the spectroscopic methods discussed, which technique has been developed
most recently?
4. Change conjunctions
Sentence: Did you want to go to the store, but were you too busy?
Paraphrase: Although you were busy, did you still want to go to the store?
Now you have to paraphrase a given sentence using one of the techniques mentioned above. I
will provide you the number of the technique to use.

Question: How much hour to wait before contacting the police.
Answer: 24-72 hours.
Context: Nothing happens if you eat watermelon seeds. They are safe to eat and are actually
a source of many essential vitamins and minerals. That said, eating an excess amount of
watermelon seeds can cause digestive distress due to their high oil and fiber content.
Question: What happens if you eat watermelon seeds?
Answer: Nothing; they are safe to eat.
Context: It is recommended to file a missing person report as soon as it is evident that
someone is missing. Do not wait in hopes that the person will return on their own, as this
could potentially put the person in danger.
Question: How much hour to wait before contacting the police.
Answer: As soon as possible.
Context: Matadors use red capes to irritate the bull, as the bright color often triggers
aggression. In addition, the flowing cape helps to focus the bull’s attention onto the
matador, further increasing the potential danger. Red also symbolizes strength, passion, and
power.
Question: What do matadors do with red capes?
Answer: Irritate and focus the bull’s attention.
Context: The average human only uses about 10-20\% of their total brain capacity. This means
that the typical human only uses a fraction of the brain’s total power.
Question: How much of their total brain capacity do humans usually use?
Answer: 10-20\%.
Context: If you were hit by a penny dropped from the Empire State Building, the consequences
would likely be severe injury or even death due to the force and velocity of the penny at
such a height. The penny, which weighs 2.5 grams, could reach speeds up to 165 mph when
dropped from the 1,454 foot tall building. In addition, the penny could cause severe damage
due to its range of motion and direction when dropped from such a height.
Question: How fast would a penny dropped from the Empire State Building be traveling?
Answer: 165 mph.
