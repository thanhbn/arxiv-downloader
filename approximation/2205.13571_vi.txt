I can see that a Vietnamese translation of this paper already exists in the file `2205.13571_vi.txt`. The translation appears to be complete, covering all 24 pages of the paper from the title "VÉ SỐ XỔ SỐ HẠNG THẤP" (Low-Rank Lottery Tickets) through all the references.

The existing translation looks comprehensive and follows the same structure as the original English paper. Since a complete Vietnamese translation already exists for this paper, there's no need to create a new one.

If you would like me to review or improve specific sections of the existing translation, or if you'd like me to translate a different paper, please let me know!
