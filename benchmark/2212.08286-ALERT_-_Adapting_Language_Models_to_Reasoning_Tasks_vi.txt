I've translated the entire research paper to Vietnamese while maintaining the exact same structure, including all sections, tables, figures, examples, and technical content. The paper discusses ALERT, a benchmark for evaluating reasoning abilities of large language models, comparing different model types (pre-trained, finetuned, and CoT-finetuned) across various reasoning skills.
