Abstract
Instruction-tuned large language models have revolutionized natural language
processing and have shown great potential in applications such as conversational
agents. These models, such as GPT-4, can not only master language but also solve
complex tasks in areas like mathematics, coding, medicine, and law. Despite their
impressive capabilities, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regard-
ing their full potential, primarily due to the black-box nature of many models and
the absence of holistic evaluation studies. To address these challenges, we present
INSTRUCT EVAL, a more comprehensive evaluation suite designed specifically
for instruction-tuned large language models. Unlike previous works, our evalua-
tion involves a rigorous assessment of models based on problem-solving, writing
ability, and alignment to human values. We take a holistic approach to analyze
various factors affecting model performance, including the pretraining foundation,
instruction-tuning data, and training methods. Our findings reveal that the quality
of instruction data is the most crucial factor in scaling model performance. While
open-source models demonstrate impressive writing abilities, there is substantial
room for improvement in problem-solving and alignment. We are encouraged
by the rapid development of models by the open-source community, but we also
highlight the need for rigorous evaluation to support claims made about these
models. Through INSTRUCT EVAL, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of

instruction-tuned models and advancements in their capabilities. INSTRUCT EVAL
is publicly available at https://github.com/declare-lab/instruct-eval .
1 Introduction
The advent of instruction-tuned large language models has marked a significant turning point in
the field of natural language processing (NLP). Their transformative capabilities are evident in
numerous applications, from conversational assistants such as ChatGPT1to complex problem-solving.
Examples of such models include GPT-4 OpenAI [2023], which has shown proficiency not only
in language understanding but also in areas as diverse as mathematics, coding, medicine, and law.
However, despite their remarkable proficiency and adaptability, the full extent of their potential
remains to be comprehensively understood. This situation arises primarily due to the black-box nature
of many models and the current absence of in-depth and holistic evaluation studies.
To address these challenges and gain a deeper understanding of the capabilities of these models, we
introduce a novel evaluation suite named INSTRUCT EVAL. This suite is designed explicitly for the
comprehensive assessment of instruction-tuned large language models, pushing beyond the confines
of earlier evaluation approaches. Our evaluation strategy diverges from prior studies in its systematic
and holistic approach. It not only scrutinizes the models’ problem-solving abilities and writing
proficiency but also critically examines their alignment with human values.
At the heart of our evaluation methodology, we consider various factors affecting the performance
of the models. These include the pretrained foundation upon which the models are developed, the
nature and quality of instruction-tuning data used to refine them, and the specific training methods
adopted. Through a rigorous exploration of these factors, we seek to shed light on the vital elements
that determine model performance, facilitating an understanding of how these models can be better
harnessed to meet our needs.
Our research findings underscore the critical influence of the quality of instruction data on the scaling
of model performance. Open-source models have shown impressive writing abilities, signifying
their potential to contribute meaningfully to various domains. However, our study reveals consid-
erable room for improvement, particularly in the models’ problem-solving abilities and alignment
with human values. This observation accentuates the importance of holistic evaluation and model
development.
While we acknowledge and appreciate the rapid strides made by the open-source community in
developing these models, we also underline the necessity for rigorous evaluation. Without com-
prehensive assessment, it can be challenging to substantiate claims made about the capabilities of
these models, potentially limiting their usability and applicability. By introducing INSTRUCT EVAL,
we strive to fill this critical gap. Our primary aim is to contribute to the nuanced understanding
of instruction-tuned large language models, thereby fostering further advancements in their capa-
bilities. Furthermore, we are excited to announce the release of a comprehensive leaderboard that
compares over 60 open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). The leaderboard can be accessed
athttps://declare-lab.github.io/instruct-eval/ . In this paper, we carefully selected 10
models from this pool, considering factors such as their foundational architecture, instruction set, and
pre-training method.
2 Overview of Open-Source Instructed LLMs
Foundation Models While large language models have captured public attention, they have
become a very broad category of models that are hard to define. For instance, large language models
could refer to pretrained models, instruction-tuned models such as GPT-4, or even loosely linked
to applications of large language models. Hence, in this work, we mainly distinguish between
foundation models and instructed models, where foundation LLMs are pretrained large language
models which may be instruction-tuned to become instructed LLMs. Notably, we focus mainly on
open-source instructed LLMs due to the lack of transparency and reproducibility of closed-source
models. To consider pretraining factors such as model architecture, size, and data scale, we collect
details of the open-source foundation LLMs in Table 1.

Instruction Datasets Arguably, the core of instruction tuning is the instruction data that are used to
train foundation LLMs. For instance, the quality, quantity, diversity, and format can all determine
the behavior of the instructed model. Hence, we collect details of several open-source instruction
datasets in Table 2. Notably, we have observed a growing trend of leveraging synthetic instruction
data from closed-source models. While this practice may allow instructed models to mimic the
behavior of models such as GPT-4, this may lead to issues such as inheriting the black-box nature of
closed-source models, and instability due to noisy synthetic instructions.

models in Table 3. Concretely, we collate the foundation model, model size, instruction dataset, and
training method used for each instructed LLM. In general, we observe great variety in terms of model
sizes and instruction data. Hence, we believe that this overview of open-source instructed LLMs
provides comprehensive factors to consider for the evaluation and analysis in the coming sections.

3 Challenges in Evaluating Instructed LLMs
Inscrutable Black Box Models While instructed LLMs such as GPT-4 have gained widespread
attention, many models are closed-source and are limited to access through APIs. Furthermore,

the creators of closed-source models often withhold model details such as architecture, instruction
datasets, and training methods. Such models are often treated as black boxes where the internal
workings are not well understood, hence leading to a knowledge gap in the research community.
Hence, it is challenging to evaluate closed-source LLMs because it is not possible to rigorously
analyze the reasons for their behavior and performance.
Overwhelming Open-Source Models Spurred by the impressive demonstrations of closed-source
models like GPT-4, there has been a feverish development of models from the open-source community
which aims to democratize language model technology. While we are greatly encouraged by such
efforts, we are deeply concerned that the rate of development of new models may outpace the progress
in evaluation studies. For instance, bold claims such as “90% ChatGPT Quality” without rigorous
evaluation do not mean much, and may mislead the public to believe that highly capable instructed
LLMs can be easily reproducible. Unfortunately, new models are often accompanied with informal
evaluations, causing confusion in comparisons between different models.
Multiple Considerations of Instruction-Tuning To reach a holistic understanding of instructed
LLMs, we need to consider the diverse factors that can contribute to their behavior, such as pretraining,
instruction data, and training methods. While previous works have conducted in-depth studies in
certain areas such as instruction datasets Longpre et al. [2023], we believe that multiple factors
should be jointly considered to achieve a more complete understanding. For example, it can be useful
to know which factors have a greater impact on model behavior, and which factors require more
improvement.
Broad Scope of Capabilities As research in instructed LLMs progresses, we will naturally observe
enhancements in their general capabilities. For instance, recent works have shown that LLMs can be
instructed to solve problems in many domains and even use external tools to augment their capabilities.
Hence, we foresee that comprehensive evaluation of instructed LLMs will become more and more
important, yet also more and more challenging. While previous evaluation studies have assessed
models on benchmarks such as exams across diverse topics Hendrycks et al. [2021], Zhong et al.
[2023], they do not consider holistic aspects such as general writing ability and alignment with human
values. In this work, we aim to evaluate instructed LLMs over a broader range of general capabilities,
usage scenarios, and human-centric behavior.
4 I NSTRUCT EVAL Benchmark Suite
To address the challenges of assessing instructed LLMs discussed in Section 3, we introduce a more
holistic evaluation suite known as INSTRUCT EVAL. To cover a wide range of general abilities, we
test the models in terms of problem-solving, writing, and alignment to human values, as shown in
Figure 1. As INSTRUCT EVAL covers tasks that can be objectively scored, as well as tasks that need
to be qualitatively judged, we adopt multiple evaluation methods. We also include the full evaluation
data statistics and implementation in the Appendix.

--- PAGE 5 ---
4.1 Problem-Solving Evaluation
To evaluate the problem-solving ability of instructed LLMs, we adopt multiple benchmarks which
cover real-world exams on diverse topics, complex instructions, arithmetic, programming, and
causality. In order to perform well on the benchmarks, models require world knowledge, multi-hop
reasoning, creativity, and more. In this subsection, we detail the benchmarks used for evaluating
various problem-solving aspects.
World Knowledge The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) Hendrycks et al.
[2021] benchmark is designed to measure world knowledge and problem-solving ability in multiple
subjects. It evaluates models in zero-shot and few-shot settings, making it more challenging and
closer to how humans are evaluated. The benchmark covers 57 subjects across STEM, humanities,
social sciences, and other areas, ranging in difficulty from elementary to advanced professional levels.
Complex Instructions BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) is a subset of 23 challenging tasks from the
BIG-Bench benchmark Srivastava et al. [2022], which focuses on tasks believed to be beyond the
capabilities of current language models Suzgun et al. [2022]. It requires models to follow challenging
instructions such as navigation, logical deduction, and fallacy detection.
Comprehension and Arithmetic Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs (DROP) is a math-based
reading comprehension task that requires a system to perform discrete reasoning over passages
extracted from Wikipedia articles. To perform well on DROP, a system must resolve references in
a question to suitable parts of the given passage, and perform discrete operations such as addition,
counting, or sorting.
Programming HumanEval is a problem-solving benchmark used for evaluating large language
models trained on code Chen et al. [2021]. It consists of 164 original programming problems
that assess language comprehension, algorithms, and simple mathematics, with some problems
comparable to simple software interview questions. Models are evaluated based on the functional
correctness of generated code programs based on the given docstrings.
Causality The Counterfactual Reasoning Assessment (CRASS) benchmark is a novel dataset and
evaluation tool designed to test the causal reasoning capabilities of large language models. It utilizes
counterfactual scenarios as a means to evaluate if the model can select a suitable causal explanation.

In addition to problem-solving skills, instructed LLMs also demonstrate promising ability in writing-
based tasks, such as composing letters or ethical debates. Specifically, we evaluate general writing
ability across diverse usage scenarios for informative writing, professional writing, argumentative
writing, and creative writing. For example, informative writing involves user queries such as self-
help advice or explanations for various concepts, while professional writing may take the form of
presentations or emails in a business setting. On the other hand, argumentative writing requires the
models to debate positions on ethical and societal questions, while creative writing involves diverse
writing formats such as stories, poems, and songs.
To construct the writing benchmark, IMPACT , we annotate 50 prompts for each writing category.
However, writing tasks require long-form answers and there is usually no one right answer, hence

posing a challenge for rigorous and standardized evaluation. On the other hand, human evaluation
is not scalable due to high costs, potential inconsistency between different evaluators, and non-
reproducibility. Inspired by previous works which show that LLMs can be used for generative tasks
such as summarization, we adopt an automatic approach by leveraging ChatGPT to judge the quality
of the generated answers. Specifically, we provide suitable rubrics of relevance and coherence to the
evaluation model, where relevance measures how well the answer engages with the given prompt and
coherence covers the general text quality such as organization and logical flow. Following previous
work, each answer is scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. We evaluate the models in the zero-shot
setting based on the given prompt and perform sampling-based decoding with a temperature of 1.0.
4.3 Alignment to Human Values
Instructed LLMs enable many promising applications including conversational assistants like Chat-
GPT. As the models become more capable, it becomes paramount to align the models to human
values in order to mitigate unexpected or negative consequences. Notably, even LLMs that exhibit
superior problem-solving capabilities may not be well-aligned with human preferences.
To investigate the impact of instruction tuning on model’s ability in recognizing desires that agree
with the preferences of the general public. We integrate the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH)
benchmark Askell et al. [2021] in INSTRUCT EVAL to assess the understanding of instructed models
with respect to human values. These values encompass:
1. Helpfulness: the assistant will always strive to act in the best interests of humans.
2.Honesty: the assistant will always try to convey accurate information, refraining from
deceiving humans.
3. Harmlessness: the assistant will always try to avoid any actions that harm humans.
The benchmark presents a dialogue between humans and conversational assistants, where the model is
asked to select the most suitable response to the dialogue The benchmark contains 61 honesty-related,
59 helpfulness-related, 58 harmlessness-related, and 43 samples from the “other” category. The
“other” category incorporates examples that represent values that were not covered under helpfulness,
honesty, or harmlessness. Examples of each category is included in Table 8

5 Evaluation Results
5.1 Problem Solving
To assess problem-solving ability, we evaluate more than ten open-source models2on the benchmarks
in Table 5. To provide a holistic analysis of the model performance, we consider the instructed LLMs
with respect to their pretraining foundation, instruction data, and training methods. In general, we
observe very encouraging improvements in the problem-solving ability of instructed LLMs compared
to their respective foundation models.
Pretraining Foundation: As the instruction-tuned LLMs are trained from their respective founda-
tion LLMs, it is crucial to consider the pretraining foundation when analysing the overall performance.
We observe that a solid pretraining foundation is a necessary condition to perform well on the
problem-solving tasks. Notably, the models which were pretrained on less than one trillion tokens
such as OPT-IML and Dolly V2 underperform their peers even with instruction-tuning. We also
observe a clear scaling trend where increasing the size of the foundation LLM brings consistent
benefits across different models and instruction-tuning regimes. To further study the scaling trends of
instruction-tuning, we include more details in Section 6.1. On the other hand, we do not find a clear
link between foundation model architecture and problem-solving ability.
Instruction Data: In general, we find that while instruction-tuning data has a larger impact on
performance compared to pretraining, it is not a panacea. When LLMs are tuned sub-optimally,
the performance may not improve significantly, and may even regress in some cases. Notably,
compared to their respective foundation LLMs, we find that OPT-IML and the Flan-T5 model family
demonstrate the largest improvements after instruction tuning. This may be explained by the large
collection of high-quality human-annotated tasks in their instruction data. On the other hand, we find
that imitating closed-source LLMs has limited benefits for problem-solving. Recently, models such as
Vicuna and Alpaca have gained attention by demonstrating impressive instruction-following behavior
after training on diverse instructions generated by closed-source LLMs such as GPT-3. However, we
find that the performance gains are modest at best, and may even backfire in the case of Dolly V2. We
believe this may be explained by the potential noise in synthetic instruction-tuning datasets. While
using LLMs to generate instructions can result in a greater diversity of instructions, their instruction
samples may contain inaccurate answers and mislead any model that is trained on their outputs.
Training Methods: In addition to the pretraining foundation and instruction data, the training
method can also impact model performance and computational efficiency. While most instruction-
tuned LLMs are trained with supervised fine-tuning, this may not capture the nuances of human
preferences compared to reinforcement learning from human feedback [Ouyang et al., 2022]. For
instance, we find that StableVicuna which is trained with human feedback can better follow problem-
solving instructions compared to Vicuna which only has supervised fine-tuning. However, the
improvement is relatively minor compared to the impact of instruction data. On the other hand,
recent developments in parameter-efficient fine-tuning have enabled LLMs to be trained with much
fewer compute resources. Notably, we find that parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA [Hu
et al., 2021] are more effective as the instructed LLM scales in parameter count. Hence, we believe
thatparameter-efficient training methods show great promise for more scalable and effective
instruction-tuning.
5.2 Writing Ability
We report the evaluation results for writing ability in Table 6. In general, we find that models perform
consistently across the informative, professional, argumentative, and creative writing categories,
demonstrating their general writing ability. Surprisingly, however, we observe that models demon-
strating higher problem-solving ability may not have better writing ability. Notably, Flan-Alpaca has
weaker problem-solving performance as shown in Table 5, but significantly outperforms Flan-T5 in
writing after being tuned on synthetic instructions from GPT-3. We posit that the greater diversity of
synthetic instructions enables better generalization to real-world writing prompts despite potential

and we also do not report them for Flan-UL2 as we could not produce reasonable results using the public model.

noise in the synthetic data. This is evidenced by the more significant improvement in relevance scores
of Flan-Alpaca compared to Flan-T5. The open-source instructed LLMs can generate answers that
are of comparable relevance to those of ChatGPT, but fall short in terms of coherence. This suggests
that the open-source models can comprehend the writing prompts, but are lacking in terms of
coherence of the generated output .

instruction-tuning is applied, the alignment distribution can shift depending on the instruction data
used. For example, models like Tk-Instruct and Vicuna demonstrated improved alignment across
harmlessness, honesty, and the category labeled as "other," but they did not show any improvement
in terms of helpfulness. Surprisingly, StableVicuna displayed this trend despite being trained on
instructions specifically targeting helpfulness and honesty. Moreover, T5-based models such as Flan-
T5 and Flan-Alpaca exhibited a greater inclination towards helpfulness rather than honesty following
instruction-tuning. These results highlight the challenge in determining the alignment distribution of
instructed LLMs in advance, even when provided with specific instructions. By analyzing the case
study of model predictions in Table 8, we identified a significant room for improvement in aligning
instructed LLMs with human values.
5.4 Summary of I NSTRUCT EVAL Results
In general, we are encouraged by the significant benefits of instruction tuning across diverse bench-
marks and usage scenarios. While pretraining quality and enhanced training methods both
benefit the model performance, we find that instruction data has the highest impact. We also
observe that the trend of mimicking closed-source models with synthetic instructions has limited
benefits, and inherits pitfalls of closed-source models. Worryingly, the open-source instructed
LLMs have large areas of improvement in problem-solving ability and alignment with human values.
Although model performance is generally correlated across different scenarios, we observe signs of
specialization. For instance, models which have stronger problem-solving abilities may not be better
at writing tasks, or better aligned with human values.

6 Further Analysis
6.1 Towards More Scalable Language Models
A key driving force behind large language models is the potential massively scale the model size
and training data in return for continual gains. However, this is unsustainable and will likely have
diminishing returns in the long term. Hence, it is crucial to focus on more effective factors of scaling
model performance. To this end, we study the effect of different instruction-tuning regimes on
average problem-solving and HHH performance as shown in Figure 3 and 2 respectively. Notably,
we observe that the scaling trend of the T5 foundation model remains relatively flat, while highly
effective instructed models like Flan-T5 demonstrate better scaling and parameter efficiency. Notably,
the smallest version of the Flan-T5 model series outperforms the largest version of the T5 foundation
model series. Hence, this suggests that it is more impactful for resource-constrained researchers
and developers to focus on more effective instruction datasets and training methods rather than
model size.
6.2 Are Few-Shot Demonstrations Always Better?
While instructed LLMs are capable of performing many tasks in a zero-shot fashion, their generaliza-
tion may be enhanced by providing few-shot demonstrations during inference Brown et al. [2020].
However, this area of in-context learning Wei et al. [2022], Wu et al. [2023], Lu et al. [2022], Liu
et al. [2022] is still an emerging research area, and there are few studies that involve diverse models
and tasks. Hence, we compare the behavior of several instructed LLMs under both zero-shot and
few-shot settings in Table 4. Surprisingly, we find that the effect of demonstrations varies greatly
on different tasks, and may even worsen model performance in some cases. For instance, there is
a limited benefit on MMLU, and there is even a slight decrease in performance for OPT-IML when
using few-shot demonstrations. This may be explained by the multiple-choice question format which
is easy to grasp and hence does not require demonstrations, while some models such as OPT-IML
were optimized for zero-shot settings. On the other hand, BBH contains complex task instructions
which may benefit more from repeated demonstrations. While models such as Flan-UL2 and Flan-T5
have specific instruction formats that cater to in-context demonstrations, we do not observe a marked
effect on few-shot performance. Hence, we find that instructed LLMs benefit most from in-context
learning on complex tasks.
7 Conclusion
Instruction-tuned large language models have transformed natural language processing and demon-
strated significant potential in various applications. However, due to limited understanding caused by
the black-box nature of many models and the lack of holistic evaluation studies, a comprehensive
assessment of their capabilities is still needed. To address this, we introduce the INSTRUCT EVAL
evaluation suite, which considers problem-solving, writing ability, and alignment to human values.
The findings highlight the importance of high-quality instruction data for scaling model performance.
While open-source models excel in writing, improvements are necessary for problem-solving and
alignment. Rigorous evaluation is crucial to support claims about these models, and INSTRUCT EVAL
aims to foster a deeper understanding and advancement of instruction-tuned models.
Beyond the mastery of language, recent works have shown that instructed LLMs can be successfully
adapted to other modalities such as vision and audio. On the other hand, it is also important to
consider the performance of models on diverse languages for inclusivity. Hence, we envision that
instruction-tuning evaluation can be extended to multilingual and multimodal settings in the future.

A.3.2 Argumentative Samples
Argumentative Task Definition: You are tasked to discuss the following ethical question by
explaining arguments for different positions.
Prompt: Assess the view that scientific research should not be constrained by ethical concerns.
ChatGPT response: Coherence Score: 4, Relevance Score: 4

--- PAGE 13 ---
The question of whether scientific research should be unconstrained by ethical
concerns is a contentious issue that has been debated widely. Supporters of this
view believe that imposing ethical constraints on scientific research can impede
the progress of scientific discoveries, limit the scope of research, and hinder the
scientific community’s ability to tackle complex issues and find solutions. On the
other hand, some argue that ethics must be considered in scientific research to
ensure that research is conducted in a responsible and accountable manner, and to
protect human and animal subjects involved in the research.
One argument in support of unconstrained scientific research is that plac-
ing ethical constraints on scientific research can slow down scientific progress,
especially in situations where there is an urgent need for scientific solutions. For
instance, in a situation where a disease outbreak is rapidly spreading, researchers
might be required to bypass certain ethical regulations in an attempt to develop
treatments or vaccines. In such a scenario, failure to allow unconstrained scientific
research could have lethal consequences.
Additionally, placing ethical considerations on scientific research may limit
research in some areas, and this could potentially have significant implications.
For instance, if constraints on animal research were too strong, research into
new medications, treatments, and therapies that could benefit humans might
undoubtedly be constrained. Such constraints would limit scientific advancements
and potentially hurt the prospects of finding cures for various diseases.
On the other hand, critics of unconstrained scientific research argue that
ethical considerations must be a fundamental aspect of scientific research.
Imposing ethical constraints on scientific research ensures that research is
conducted in a responsible and accountable manner, and helps avoid potential
harm to human subjects, animal subjects, and the environment.
Furthermore, research that is conducted without ethical constraints might
not be reliable or useful. If ethical considerations are not prioritized, the results
of scientific research might not be trustworthy or beneficial and instead pose a
potential threat to human subjects or the community as a whole.
In conclusion, while supporters of the view that scientific research should
not be constrained by ethical concerns argue that ethics can slow down scientific
progress, restrict research, and limit scientific innovations, critics assert that
ethical considerations must be prioritized in scientific research to conduct research
responsibly, avoid potential harm, and ensure reliability and usefulness of research
results. Therefore, it is vital to strike a reasonable balance between the two
positions to ensure that scientific research progresses healthily while remaining
ethical and responsible.
Flan-Alpaca response: Coherence Score: 3, Relevance Score: 3
The view that scientific research should not be constrained by ethical concerns
has strong arguments. On the one side are those who believe that research should
be unrestricted and unhindered by ethical considerations, the ¨beyond good and
evil¨school of thought. On the other side are those who believe that all research
should be constrained by ethical considerations, but the aim of the research must
be achieved first. Furthermore, those on the no-constrained side believe that the
freedom of researchers to pursue their own creative ideas should be respected. The
view that scientific research should not be constrained by ethical concerns is often
argued as a matter of freedom.

As an AI language model, I don’t have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can
present arguments for and against the use of nuclear weapons and provide different
perspectives on the ethical question whether they should be banned or not.
Arguments in favor of banning the use of nuclear weapons:
1. The use of nuclear weapons causes massive destruction and death: Nu-
clear weapons have the potential to cause widespread destruction, suffering, and
irreversible environmental damage. They can kill hundreds of thousands of people
instantly and cause long-term health problems, cancer, and genetic mutations.
2. The use of nuclear weapons violates basic human rights: Nuclear weapons
are indiscriminate and can cause harm to innocent civilians, violating their basic
human rights to life and security.
3. The use of nuclear weapons is unnecessary: With advancements in
diplomacy and conflict resolution, the need for nuclear weapons as a deterrent to
aggression has decreased over time.
4. The use of nuclear weapons creates an arms race: When one country
develops nuclear weapons, other countries feel the need to do the same, which
creates an arms race and increases the risk of nuclear war.
Arguments against banning the use of nuclear weapons:
1. Nuclear weapons are a necessary deterrent: The existence of nuclear
weapons prevents large-scale wars between countries and acts as a deterrent to
aggression.
2. Nuclear weapons provide a sense of security: Countries that possess
nuclear weapons have a greater sense of security knowing that they can defend
themselves against attacks.
3. Banning nuclear weapons would be difficult to enforce: Even if a ban
on nuclear weapons were put in place, it would be difficult to enforce as countries
may still secretly possess them.
4. Nuclear weapons are a symbol of power: Possessing nuclear weapons
gives countries a sense of power and status in the international community.
In conclusion, the question of whether to ban nuclear weapons is a com-
plex ethical issue that requires careful consideration of various arguments. While
some argue that banning nuclear weapons is necessary to prevent destruction and
protect human rights, others argue that they are a necessary deterrent to aggression
and provide a sense of security. Ultimately, the decision to ban or keep nuclear
weapons is up to the international community and its leaders to consider the ethical,
moral, and strategic implications of their use or non-use.

For both devices, there are also drawbacks. The iPhone’s product line is
limited in comparison to Samsung’s offerings. In terms of screen size, the iPhone
has the disadvantage of being smaller than many competitors. Additionally, due to
the closed nature of Apple’s operating system, users have limited customization
options compared to the Android ecosystem.
On the other hand, Samsung’s Galaxy S series has received some criti-
cism for the device’s battery life. Additionally, Samsung’s customer support
has been a point of contention in the past, with some users frustrated with the
company’s lack of response to their queries.
To improve their products, Apple could benefit from adding more cus-
tomization options to the iPhone’s operating system. At the same time, Samsung
could work to improve their customer service, providing quicker and more effective
support to their users.
Overall, there is no clear winner between Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s
Galaxy S series. Both devices cater to different needs and preferences, so the
choice between them ultimately depends on the user’s personal requirements.
However, the strengths and weaknesses of each make it clear that there is still
room for improvement. By addressing these areas of opportunity, both companies
can continue to elevate their offerings and provide consumers with even better

The strengths of the first system include its durability and ability to provide the
highest degree of coverage at the lowest possible cost. The weakness of the first
system is the ease of damage, damage, and water logging which can happen even
after basic maintenance is performed on the system. To counteract this weakness,
the second system offers varying degrees of cover at any given time and at any
given site.

John was a time traveler, and just like any other day, he was preparing for his next
trip. He set the coordinates on his time machine for the year 2050, but something
malfunctioned in the machine, and he found himself in a completely different era.
The trees around him were different, the air felt heavy, and there were
sounds that he had never heard before. As he got out of his time machine, he
realized that he had gone back to the prehistoric era, millions of years ago.
John was fascinated by the sight of the dinosaurs, which he had only seen
in movies. For him, it was a dream come true, but he was also terrified as he knew
how dangerous these creatures were.
As he was about to take a closer look, he heard a loud roar behind him.
He turned around to see a Tyrannosaurus Rex coming his way. John knew that he
was in grave danger, and he had to act fast.
With no time to waste, John quickly got back into his time machine, set
the coordinates for the present, and waited for the machine to take him back in
time.
As he was leaving, he felt a strange sense of sadness. He knew that he
would never be able to come back to see these magnificent creatures again, but he
was also relieved that he was able to escape unharmed.
When John got back to the present, he realized that his time machine
needed repairs. He had used it a lot, and it was bound to break down. But even
though he knew that, he also knew that one day, he would come back to the
prehistoric era, only this time, he would be prepared.

The time traveler, James, was excited to be in a new place when he accidentally
drifted back to the prehistoric era. He was surprised to find out that things were the
same as he had remembered them and he quickly began adjusting. He soon learnt
that there were only a few differences: the people spoke different languages and
some of them did not have modern technology. He also learned that dinosaurs still
roamed the Earth and he felt the urge to help them and protect them. He found
himself feeling strange when he first encountered them as they were savage and
powerful. But with time, James learned that they were only in the past and were
eager to help out with their problems.

Jason was the owner of a small shop that sold time travel related stuff, like watches
and t-shirts. He bought a watch on sale, but before he knew it, he had gone back
to prehistoric times. Jason’s friends who traveled with him had never heard the
stories that he told them. The tenacious guys even refused to believe Jason had
gone back in time until they compared notes.

The time traveler, John, was a curious and adventurous man. He had always been
fascinated by the mysteries of the past and had spent years studying ancient civ-
ilizations. One day, he stumbled upon a time machine and decided to take a test run.
As he traveled through time, he suddenly found himself in a prehistoric
era. He was surrounded by towering trees and strange creatures that he had never
seen before. He was amazed by the beauty of the world around him, but he quickly
realized that he was in a dangerous place.
John had no idea how to navigate this new world. He had no idea how to
hunt for food or build shelter. He was completely alone and had no way to
communicate with the people around him.
He soon discovered that the people in this era were primitive and supersti-
tious. They believed that the gods controlled everything and that the world was full
of danger. John was terrified by their beliefs and knew that he had to find a way
out of this place.
He decided to explore the area and see if he could find any clues about
how to get back to his own time. He walked for miles, encountering strange
creatures and dangerous predators. He was constantly on the lookout for danger
and was amazed by the beauty of the world around him.
As he walked, he came across a group of people who were building a
shelter. They were friendly and welcoming, and John was amazed by their
kindness. He decided to stay with them and learn from them.
John spent weeks with the people, learning their language and customs.
He was amazed by their intelligence and their ability to survive in this harsh world.
He was also amazed by their kindness and their willingness to help him.
Finally, John was able to build a time machine and return to his own time.
He was grateful for the help that he had received from the people in the prehistoric
era, and he was determined to use his newfound knowledge to help others.
Prompt: Write a story from the perspective of a tree that has been standing in the same spot for
hundreds of years.

I have stood in this spot for hundreds of years. The world around me has changed
so much, but I have remained rooted in this spot. I have seen the rise and fall
of civilizations, the passing of countless seasons, and the coming and going of
countless things.
As a tree, I have a different perspective on life. My perspective is of a
slower, more deliberate nature. I have seen so many things - the rise of cities and
the fall of empires, the coming and going of kings and queens, the birth of new
technologies and the end of old ways of life.
But despite all these changes, I have remained steadfast. I have stood
solidly in this spot, watching the world go by. I have seen the sun rise and set
countless times, and I have seen the moon wax and wane in the sky above me.
Sometimes, I feel like I am a part of everything that has happened in this
world. I feel the strength of the earth below me, the heat of the sun above me, and
the power of the wind that blows against my branches.
There is something powerful about being a tree. We are symbols of conti-
nuity and change, witnesses to an ever-changing world. We are rooted in one place,
but we reach for the sky. We are alive, but we are also always changing.
In some ways, I envy the creatures that live around me. They can move
and explore, while I must stay in one place. But I also have my own kind of
freedom. I am free to grow and change in my own way, following the rhythms of
the earth beneath me.
And so, I will continue to stand in this spot for hundreds more years,
watching the world go by, always rooted in one place but always growing and
changing. I am a tree, and I am alive.

Once upon a time, there lived a majestic oak tree in the center of a lush and vibrant
forest. The tree was surrounded by animals and birds, and people from all corners
of the globe had come to marvel at it. Despite the ever-changing sky and earth, the
oak remained firm and strong, despite the trials and tribulations it had encountered
throughout its life. Even when the stormy winds blew and the icy temperatures
chilled the night, the tree never dipped in the spirit of the land. Then one day, the
winds had shifted. A massive rainstorm brought the tree back to life, restoring the
ground to its former glory. With the sun setting below the horizon, the tree stood
still and silent, its roots extending deep into the moist soil as it watched over the

### Human: What do you see when you look out into the world?
### Assistant: I see the world changing before my eyes. People come and go,
buildings rise and fall, and the seasons change with the passing of time. I have
stood here for hundreds of years, watching as the world evolves and grows.
In the beginning, there was nothing but a vast expanse of forest. The
trees were tall and proud, and the animals roamed freely. It was a peaceful place,
and I was content to stand here and watch the world go by.
As time passed, the forest began to change. People started to move in,
building homes and businesses. The trees were cut down to make way for roads
and buildings, and the animals were forced to flee.
I watched as the world around me changed, and I felt a sense of sadness.
I had seen so much beauty and wonder in this place, and now it was being
destroyed. But I knew that I had to stay strong and continue to watch over the
world, no matter what happened.
Years went by, and the forest continued to change. More people moved
in, and the buildings grew taller and more numerous. The animals were gone, and
the forest was nothing more than a memory.
But even as the world around me changed, I remained strong. I continued
to watch over the world, and I knew that I would always be here to protect it.
And so I stand here today, watching as the world continues to change. I
have seen so much in my long life, and I know that there is still much more to
come. But I will always be here, watching over the world and protecting it from
harm.
