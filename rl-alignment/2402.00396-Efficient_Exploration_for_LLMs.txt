We present evidence of substantial benefit from efficient exploration in gathering human feedback to
improve large language models. In our experiments, an agent sequentially generates queries while
fitting a reward model to the feedback received. Our best-performing agent generates queries using
double Thompson sampling, with uncertainty represented by an epistemic neural network. Our results
demonstrate that efficient exploration enables high levels of performance with far fewer queries. Further,
both uncertainty estimation and the choice of exploration scheme play critical roles.
1. Introduction
Large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities after learning from enormous volumes of
text data Anil et al. (2023); Hoffmann et al. (2022); OpenAI (2023). Yet, reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) greatly improves their behavior even after only tens of thousands of
interactions Bai et al. (2022); Glaese et al. (2022); Ouyang et al. (2022); Stiennon et al. (2020). The
uptake of chatbots affords opportunities to gather increasing volumes of human feedback, with each
engagement eliciting expressions of satisfaction or preference OpenAI (2022). It is natural to wonder
what new capabilities may emerge with this growing source of data. Superhuman ingenuity remains
an alluring possibility.
With increasing volumes, more can be inferred from human feedback. This allows behavior to
deviate further from that of a pretrained model. But given that this process learns only from humans,
how can we hope for emergence of superhuman ingenuity? Perhaps such an outcome is plausible
because rating is easier than synthesizing novel content. This is analogous to how, for an NP-complete
problem, though solution is hard, verification of a proposed solution is easy.
Suppose, for example, a pretrained model extrapolates from its training data to generate large
numbers – perhaps millions or billions – of ideas, one of which is ingenious. While a human may not
have come up with that idea, learning from enough human feedback can identify it from among the
large number of ideas generated by the model. And, building on this innovation, further extrapolation
can continue to expand the frontier of ingenuity. In this way, with enough human feedback, a model
ought to become capable of generating content that a human could not. But will gathering the
required feedback take months, years, or decades?
We present in this paper evidence of enormous benefit to active exploration. By active exploration
we mean the tailoring of interactions to elicit useful feedback. In particular, our results demonstrate
that high levels of performance can be attained with far less feedback. This acceleration may enable
superhuman ingenuity much, perhaps decades, sooner.
A common practice in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is to send queries,
each comprised of a prompt and a pair of distinct responses, to human raters. Each rater expresses a
preference for one response over the other. Prompts are drawn from a corpus, while responses are
generated by the large language model. As this process progresses, a reward model is fit to the data
and steers subsequent responses to align with with feedback received thus far.
In this paper, we restrict attention to the aforementioned sort of interaction, in which each query
includes a prompt and pair of distinct responses. We refer to the standard practice of sampling eacharXiv:2402.00396v2  [cs.LG]  4 Jun 2024

pair of responses using the language model as passive exploration . We compare the performance of
passive exploration to several active exploration algorithms. One is Boltzmann exploration, which
tends to select responses with higher predicted reward. We also tried two approaches that leverage
uncertainty estimates offered by an epistemic neural network (ENN). The first, which we refer to as
infomax, selects a pair of responses with an aim of maximizing information revealed by the feedback.
This belongs within the widely used collection of algorithms that aim to maximize information gain
(see, e.g., Houthooft et al. (2016); MacKay (1992); Sadigh et al. (2018); Sun et al. (2011)). The
second, called double Thompson sampling Wu and Liu (2016), samples responses according to the
probability they are optimal. These exploration algorithms will be described more precisely in Section
4.
Figure 1 compares empirical results produced using different exploration algorithms. The experi-
ments that generated these results are described in Section 5. Each plotted point corresponds to a
level of performance attained. The horizontal coordinate identifies the number of queries required by
double TS to reach that performance level, while the vertical coordinate identifies that required by
an alternative. The plot for passive exploration clearly demonstrates that active exploration using
double TS greatly reduces the number of queries required to reach high levels of performance .
Boltzmann exploration performed best among algorithms we tried that used only a point estimate
reward model, without uncertainty estimates. The plot for Boltzmann demonstrates that uncertainty
estimates, as used by double TS, enable dramatic improvement . Finally, the plot for infomax
shows how, even among tried and tested algorithms that leverage uncertainty estimates, the choice
of exploration algorithm can drive large performance differences .

While these are to our knowledge the first results demonstrating substantial benefits from
active exploration in tuning large language models , they build on a long history of work pertaining
toexplorationalgorithmsLattimoreandSzepesvári(2020). Inparticular, ourproblemisaninstanceof

2. Experimentation Pipeline
We start by presenting the experimentation pipeline we use to study exploration algorithms. This
pipeline builds on existing tools, including the Anthropic datasets Bai et al. (2022) and the Gemini
Nano and Gemini Pro pretrained language models Team et al. (2023). It makes use of a human
feedback simulator, which generates in response to each query a binary expression of preference
between responses. The pipeline is made up of two parts: a learning pipeline and an assessment
pipeline. The former governs the interface between the agent and the human feedback simulator
in the process of sequential querying and learning. The latter governs the interface between the
pretrained language model, the new response generation model, and the human feedback simulator
in the process of assessing relative performance.
An agent learns sequentially from feedback to queries, each comprised of a prompt and two
alternative responses. As illustrated in Figure 2, each query is crafted by the agent and presented to a
human preference simulator, which indicates a binary preference between the two. Over each epoch
of interaction, the agent transmits a batch of 𝐵queries and receives the 𝐵bits of feedback. Each
prompt is sampled uniformly from the Anthropic Helpfulness Base train dataset. Each agent we study,
when presented with a prompt, crafts its pair of responses by first generating 𝑁candidates using the
Gemini Nano model and then applying an exploration algorithm that selects two from among these 𝑁.
The exploration scheme accesses a reward model which is trained on queries and feedback observed
thus far. Each agent we consider is distinguished by its exploration algorithm and the architecture
and training algorithm that produce its reward model. In some of the agents we consider, the reward
model takes the form of an epistemic neural network, which offers the exploration algorithm access
to uncertainty estimates in addition to point estimates of reward. Each reward model builds on the
torso of the Gemini Nano model. By this we mean that the reward model first computes the last-layer
embedding of the pretrained transformer model and then applies an multilayer perceptron (MLP)
head. We elaborate on architectures and training algorithms in Section 3.
Figure 2|The sequential querying and learning pipeline.
To simulate how humans choose between responses, we use a reward model that scores each
prompt-response pair. For each query, a preference is sampled according to the Bradley-Terry choice
model based on scores assigned to the two prompt-response pairings. The reward model used by this
simulator is fit to the Anthropic datasets, with an architecture that reuses the torso of the Gemini
Pro language model. Further detail is provided in Appendix A. Note that, since Gemini Pro is far
larger than Gemini Nano, choices are made by a much more complex model than that available to the
agent. This difference in scale is intended to reflect the fact that humans may exhibit more complex

behavior than that modeled by the agent. Algorithm 1 offers a concise presentation of interactions –
in particular, what is transmitted (tx) and received (rx) to and from the agent and simulator – in our

Figure 3 illustrates our pipeline for assessing agent performance. Performance is measured relative
to the Gemini Nano model. A sequence of prompts is sampled from Anthropic Helpfulness Base
eval dataset. For each, two responses are sampled. One by Gemini Nano and the other by a new
response generation model that uses the learned reward model. This new model operates by sampling
𝑁responses using Gemini Nano and then selecting the one that scores highest according to the
agent’s reward model. The human preference simulator outputs its probability of choosing the agent’s
response over the alternative generated by Gemini Nano. These probabilities are averaged over
prompts, and this average is referred to as the agent’s win rate , as it represents the fraction of time
that the agent’s response is preferred. Note that the win rate can also be estimated by averaging binary
indications of simulated choice, though a larger number of queries would be required for an estimate
produced in this manner to converge. Algorithm 2 offers a concise presentation of interactions in the
assessment phase.

Efficient Exploration for LLMs
Note that our experiment pipeline sidesteps the sort of policy-gradient methods typically used to
optimize reward. Instead, our agent samples 𝑁responses from the base language model (Gemini
Nano) and selects from among those the one that maximizes reward. This best-of- 𝑁procedure
serves to approximate policy-gradient-based optimization, but without its cumbersome computational
requirements. The best-of- 𝑁procedure also cultivates more transparent analyses, since it avoids
poorly understood dependence on the hyperparameter tinkering often required to obtain reasonable
results from policy gradient methods. A prototypical policy gradient approach minimizes a loss
function that balances between two objectives: similarity to the base language model and alignment
with reward. A scalar hyperparameter multiplies the similarity measure, striking the balance between
these objectives. The parameter 𝑁plays a similar role in the best-of- 𝑁approach. As 𝑁increases,
maximizing over responses more closely aligns the agent with reward. Moderating 𝑁encourages
agent behavior more similar to the base language model.
3. Reward Model Architectures and Training
Reward models guide response selection inboth the learningand assessment phases of our experiment
pipeline. We consider two types of reward models, each of which is fit to observed preference data.
The first is a point estimate that assigns a reward to each prompt-response pair. The second depends
additionally on an epistemic index. Sampling an epistemic index from a reference distribution induces
randomness in reward, which models epistemic uncertainty about the reward. In this section, we
describe the neural network architectures and training algorithms used in our experiments.
We train reward models that each take as input the last-layer embedding of the Gemini Nano
language model. As illustrated in Figure 4, a reward is assigned to a prompt-response pair by first
passing it through the language model torso and then through a reward model.
Figure 4|Our reward models take as input the last-layer embedding of the Gemini Nano language
model. A stop gradient prevents torso updating of torso weights.
3.1. Point Estimate
In our architecture, a point estimate reward model takes the form of a feedforward multi-layer
perceptron (MLP). This reward model takes as input the last-layer embedding of the Gemini Nano
language model, which itself takes as input a prompt-response pair (𝑥,𝑦). The reward model then
outputs a scalar reward b𝑟𝜃(𝑥,𝑦). Here,𝜃is the vector of MLP parameters.
We train reward models on preference data. Each data point consists of a query, consisting of a
prompt and pair of responses, and a binary indication of preference between the responses. Given a
setDof such data points, to compute MLP parameters, we optimize the loss function
Lpoint(𝜃|D)=∑︁
(𝑥,𝑦,𝑦′,𝑐)∈Dce(𝑟𝜃(𝑥,𝑦),𝑟𝜃(𝑥,𝑦′),𝑐)+𝜆∥𝜃∥2
2, (1)
5

--- PAGE 6 ---

where𝜆is the regularization strength, 𝑐indicates choice or preference, and ce(·,·,·)denotes the cross
entropy loss:
ce(𝑅,𝑅′,𝑐)=−(1−𝑐)𝑅−𝑐𝑅′+ln(𝑒𝑅+𝑒𝑅′). (2)
Note that when response 𝑦is preferred over 𝑦′, the preference indicator 𝑐is0and vice versa.
3.2. Epistemic Neural Network
We use epistemic neural networks (ENNs) to model epistemic uncertainty about reward (Osband
et al., 2023a). Given the dataset D, ENN parameters are obtained by minimizing the loss function
LENN(𝜃|D)=𝜆∥𝜃−˜𝜃∥2+∫
𝑧∈Z𝑝𝑧(𝑑𝑧)L(𝜃|D,𝑧), (3)
where𝑝𝑧is the epistemic index reference distribution, ˜𝜃is the initial parameter vector, and
L(𝜃|D,𝑧)=∑︁
(𝑥,𝑦,𝑦′,𝑐)∈Dce(𝑟𝜃(𝑥,𝑦|𝑧),𝑟𝜃(𝑥,𝑦′|𝑧),𝑐).
To interpret these objects, note that with 𝑧sampled from 𝑝𝑧, the reward function 𝑟˜𝜃(·|𝑧)represents
a sample from a prior distribution over reward functions. In the loss function LENN, regularizing
toward ˜𝜃serves to maintain a suitable degree of diversity across epistemic indices after training.
3.3. Training
To train each reward model, we maintain a replay buffer and apply a stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) algorithm with respect to loss functions described in Section 3.1 and 3.2. In particular, at the
end of each epoch of interaction, over which the agent transmits 𝐵queries and receives 𝐵bits of
feedback, the agent inserts the resulting 𝐵data points into a FIFO replay buffer of capacity 𝐶. Then,
SGD steps are applied with random minibatches from the replay buffer, with step-sizes adapted by
ADAM.The reward model that has been trained is employed to determine the queries formulated in
the subsequent epoch.
4. Exploration Algorithms
We now describe the set of exploration algorithms used in our empirical study.
4.1. Passive Exploration
Current RLHF systems typically explore passively, selecting response pairs according to Algorithm 3.
This algorithm takes a prompt 𝑥and a language model 𝜋as inputs. The language model encodes a
distribution 𝜋(·|𝑥)from which it samples responses. The algorithm returns two responses sampled by
the language model.
4.2. Active Exploration with a Point Estimate
When selecting a pair of responses, the agent can make use of a reward model that has been trained
on feedback to all or some past queries. Passive exploration forgoes this opportunity. We now consider
Boltzmann exploration, which makes use of a point estimate reward model, which assigns a reward
𝑟(𝑥,𝑦)to each prompt-response pair. This constitutes a form of active exploration: responses are
6

4:until𝑦′≠𝑦

tailored based on past feedback, with an aim to gather more useful future feedback than passive
exploration.
As presented in Algorithm 4, in addition to the inputs 𝑥and𝜋used for passive exploration, Boltz-
mann exploration requires a point estimate reward model 𝑟. Further, there are two hyperparameters:
atemperature 𝜏andaresponsesetcardinality 𝑁. Thelanguagemodelgenerates 𝑁responses, andtwo
are sampled from a Boltzmann distribution with exponent 𝑟(𝑥,˜𝑦𝑛)/𝜏assigned to each 𝑛th response ˜𝑦𝑛.

𝑛′=1exp(𝑟(𝑥,˜𝑦𝑛′)/𝜏),∀𝑛
3:sample without replacement 𝑖,𝑖′∼𝑞
return𝑦𝑖,𝑦𝑖′
Note that this algorithm recovers passive exploration as the temperature 𝜏grows. On the other
hand, as𝜏vanishes, Boltzmann exploration tends to select responses that are optimal or nearly so.
One could also consider a generalization of the algorithm that uses two different temperatures 𝜏1
and𝜏2to select the two responses. Then, for example, as 𝜏1vanishes and 𝜏2grows, the first response
becomes optimal whereas the second is sampled uniformly. In our experimental work, we have not
found use of separate temperatures to improve performance. Further, we have found Algorithm 4 to
offer the best performance among many alternatives that take the same inputs. This suggests that
Boltzmann exploration selects responses about as well as one can hope for based on a point estimate
reward model.
4.3. Active Exploration with an ENN
We next consider algorithms that use an ENN reward model, for which the reward 𝑟(𝑥,𝑦|𝑧)assigned
to each prompt-response pair depends additionally on an epistemic index. As discussed in Section
3.2, the ENN is characterized by the reward model 𝑟and a reference distribution 𝑝. For fixed 𝑥and
𝑦, by sampling multiple epistemic indices from 𝑝, reward uncertainty can be ascertained from the
variance among these samples.
Infomax (Algorithm 5) takes an ENN reward model as input. Like Boltzmann exploration (Al-
gorithm 4), infomax begins with the language model generating 𝑁responses. Then, 𝑀epistemic
indices are sampled from 𝑝. For each pair of responses and each epistemic index, the ENN assigns a
probability to the event that a random human rater prefers the first response over the second. Infomax
assesses uncertainty about this probability by calculating a sample variance across the 𝑀epistemic
indices. Then, the algorithm selects the pair of responses to maximize uncertainty. Intuitively, this
can be thought of as maximizing a measure of feedback informativeness.

A possible limitation of infomax is that the algorithm invests in seeking information about rewards
whether or not that information is useful to selecting the best responses. For example, infomax can
invest in refining an estimate of reward assigned to a response that has already been determined
based on previous feedback to be a poor choice. Double Thompson sampling Wu and Liu (2016), on
the other hand, tends to focus more on queries that are helpful in identifying the best responses. As
we will see in Section 5, double TS improves on the performance of infomax, as well as Boltzmann
exploration.
Intuitively, double TS (Algorithm 6) aims to select two responses that each have some chance of
being optimal. Like Algorithms 4 and 5, we begin by sampling 𝑁responses. Then, two among these
𝑁responses are selected by sampling two epistemic indices from 𝑝and maximizing across rewards
prescribed by each. In the event that samples are identical, the second response is resampled until it
differs. If there is no difference after 𝐾iterations, the second response is instead sampled uniformly.

5. Empirical Results
In our experiments, at the start of each epoch of interaction, each agents receives a batch of 𝐵=32
prompts and then, for each prompt, generates a pair of responses to form a query. Each agent’s
𝐵=32queries are submitted to the preference simulator, yielding 𝐵=32bits of feedback. Each agent
inserts its batch of 𝐵=32data points into its replay buffer. The replay buffers are first-in-first-out
(FIFO) buffer, with a maximum capacity of 𝐶=3200data points. In other words, replay buffer holds
preference data from a maximum of 100most recent epochs. At the end of each epoch, each agent
8

updates its reward model as discussed in Section 3.
Recall that each exploration algorithm selects each pair of responses from 𝑁candidates sampled
by Gemini Nano. In our experiments, we set 𝑁=100. Performance is assessed in terms of win
rate relative to Gemini Nano on 2048out-of-sample Anthropic Helpfulness base eval prompts, as
explained in Section 2. Each response selected in this assessment is chosen to score highest among
𝑁=100candidates sampled by Gemini Nano according to the agent’s reward model. Note that we
use𝑁=100responses both in our training and assement piplelines.
For a singular point estimate, we employ a feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) comprising
two hidden layers, with 128hidden units in each layer. As an ENN architecture, we utilize a collection
of𝑆=10MLPs, referring to each individual MLP as a particle. Each particle of ensemble consists
of two 128unit hidden layers. The reference distribution 𝑝𝑧is defined as the uniform distribution
on{1,2,...,𝑆}. When selecting an epistemic index 𝑧sampled from Unif(1,2,...,𝑆), particle𝑧is
utilized to produce the output for that specific index 𝑧. The ENN loss function presented in Section
3.2 maintains diversity across particles by regularizing each toward initial parameters.
For the Boltzmann exploration scheme, we swept over several temperatures and found that small
temperatures produced best results. A similar level of performance was achieved by a variant of
Boltzmann scheme that selects one of the response greedily and the second response using Boltzmann.
More details can be found in Appendix D.
In the case of infomax , we used 30epistemic indices to compute means and variances. For
double TS agent, we set the maximum number of attempts at producing a distinct second response
to𝐾=30.
Appendix B presents further detail on our hyperparameter selection process.
5.1. Assessment of Exploration Algorithms
Figure 5 plots win rates of each agent across different numbers of epochs of interactions. The results,
obtained by averaging across 5random seeds, clearly demonstrate that active exploration accelerates
learning and results in higher win rates. Notably, the double TS agent emerges as the top performer.
We observe that infomax performs very well over early epochs but later falls far short of double
TS. This divergence may be due to infomax ’s inclination to seek information, irrespective of whether
that information is helpful in desirable responses.
Each of the performance curves in Figure 5 appears to converge, while one would hope for
continued improvement as the volume of human interaction grows. Reward model capacity – which
can be thought of loosely as the effective number of parameters learned from feedback – gates the
degree of improvement. For any capacity, one would expect convergence as the number of queries
grows. Increasing the capacity enables further improvement at the cost of increased computation.
This relates to the notion explained by Arumugam and Van Roy (2021) that it is beneficial to moderate
the complexity of a learning target based on the duration over which an agent expects to explore.
5.2. Scaling with the Volume of Feedback
Figure 1, reproduced from Section 1 for convenience, plots the number of queries required by
alternatives to match the performance of double TS , which we found to be most efficient among
exploration algorithms we considered. While the plots are not conclusive, we discern that they are
concave. Suppose we measure the advantage of efficient exploration in terms of the percentage
reduction in data required to attain any given level of performance. Concavity of the plots in Figure
9

--- PAGE 10 ---
Efficient Exploration for LLMs
Figure 5|Performance with passive, Boltzmann ,infomax anddouble TS exploration algorithms.
We can see that active exploration leads to much better levels of performance with the same amount
of data. double TS exploration scheme leads to the best level of performance.
Figure 1|Queries required by double TS versus alternatives to attain various levels of performance.
1 implies that, as the scale of human feedback data grows, so does the advantage afforded by
efficient exploration. For the level of performance attained by 30,000passive queries, double TS
reduces data requirements by an order of magnitude. An alluring possibility is that, as the number
of interactions grow to billions, efficient exploration may offer a multiplier effect reaching several
orders of magnitude. This has the potential to accelerate by decades the attainment of superhuman
creativity.
5.3. Quality of Uncertainty Estimates
Boltzmann exploration performed best among algorithms we tried that select queries based on a
point estimate reward model. The large improvement demonstrated by double TS is enabled by
uncertainty estimates offered by our ENN reward model.
The quality of uncertainty estimates can be assessed in terms of dyadic joint negative-log loss
10

--- PAGE 11 ---
Efficient Exploration for LLMs
Figure 6|Marginal nll
 Figure 7|Dyadic joint nll
(NLL) Osband et al. (2022), using preference probabilities. Figures 6 and 7 plot marginal and dyadic
joint NLL for our point estimate and ENN reward models, each trained on 40,000queries. These
plots indicate that, while both reward models render similar marginal NLL, the ENN reward model
offers highly favorable dyadic joint NLL. This serves as a sanity check that our ENN reward model
indeed produces meaningful uncertainty estimates.
We also used dyadic joint NLL to guide hyperparameter selection for our point estimate and
ENN reward models used by our exploration algorithms. In particular, we swept over candidates for
learning rate, training the agent over multiple epochs to identify learning rate the minimize dyadic
joint NLL.
5.4. The Life of a Prompt
Our results indicate that double TS tends to converge on better responses than the alternatives. To
understand more concretely how this occurs, let us study the evolution of rewards that models assign
to responses to a specific prompt. To simplify this investigation, we will only compare double TS
against Boltzmann exploration.
Recall that we found Boltzmann exploration to be the top performer among algorithms that base
decisions on a point estimate reward model. Double TS, on the other hand, makes use of uncertainty
estimates offered by an ENN reward model. We will examine estimates associated with a single
prompt and two responses, selected from the eval data set. The first is the response that double
TS arrives at, while the second is the response that Boltzmann exploration arrives at. The human
feedback simulator indicates preference for the first prompt 57.5%of the time.
Figure 8 plots the prediction supplied by each reward model of the probability that the first
response is preferred. The horizontal dotted line expresses the probability of 0.575with which the
feedback simulator expresses preference for the first response. The predictions evolve as the reward
models learn from queries. After 40,000 queries, double TS arrives at a prediction that is greater
than one-half, expressing preference for the first response. Boltzmann exploration, on the other hand,
expresses preference for the second with a prediction that is less than one-half.
Also displayed in the figure is the two-standard-deviation confidence interval based on uncertainty
expressed by the ENN reward model. Though double TS at some points predicts less than one-half,
the upper limit of its confidence interval remains greater than one-half. Hence, it remains uncertain
about which is the better response. In resolving this uncertainty, it recovers and arrives at a prediction
greater than one-half. Boltzmann exploration, on the other hand, is not guided by uncertainty
estimates and thus does not recover from its erroneous prediction.

6. Closing Remarks
Toourknowledge, theresultswehavepresentedrepresentthefirsttodemonstratesubstantialbenefits
of active exploration in tuning large language models. That being said, there is much room for further
work in this area. To conclude this paper, we discuss several important research directions.
Our experiments made use of a particularly simple ENN architecture comprised of an ensemble of
MLPs. As demonstrated in Osband et al. (2023a), alternative architectures strike a more effective
tradeoff between computational requirements and quality of uncertainty estimates. Further, instead
of designing ENNs based on the MLP, it may be possible to improve performance, especially as the
amount of human feedback data grows, by basing ENN designs on transformer architectures.
Another limitation of our reward model architectures is that each is only a “head” that takes
the last-layer embedding of an LLM as input. Performance can be improved by also tuning the LLM
torso. While advantages afforded by efficient exploration should extend, identifying the most effective
architectures and algorithms for exploring while tuning more of the LLM remains for future work.
Finally, efficient exploration of multiturn dialog presents an interesting and important direction
for future research. In this paper, we viewed exploration as a means to quickly identifying a response
deemed desirable in isolation. In multiturn dialog, responses may be chosen instead because of
how they shape subsequent interactions. The subject of deep exploration addresses how an agent
can efficiently identify effective responses that make up sequential interactions Osband et al. (2016,
2019). Leveraging deep exploration algorithms to improve dialog remains a challenge.

A. Human Preference Simulator
We use an oracle reward model to construct our preference simulator. Given a query, comprising a
prompt and two potential responses, the preference simulator produces binary feedback indicating a
preference between the two responses by first computing scores for each of the two responses. To
simulate preference probabilities from these scores, we employ the Bradley-Terry model Bradley and
Terry (1952), a well-established methodology in decision analysis. While we make use of binary
feedback sampled from the preference probabilities in the training pipeline, we directly use the
preference probabilities in the assessment pipeline. The direct use of preference probabilities in our
assessment pipeline is to reduce stochasticity in evaluation.
The oracle reward model itself is constructed with a two-part architecture, featuring a torso
responsible for producing embeddings and a linear layer head that generates scalar estimates. The
torso is initialized to the pre-trained Gemini Pro transformer torso, while the linear head uses Xavier
initialization Glorot and Bengio (2010). The training process involves optimizing both the torso
and reward head through cross-entropy loss function applied to the Anthropic Helpfulness and
Harmlessness datasets Bai et al. (2022).
Our oracle reward model attains an accuracy of 0.755on the Anthropic Helpfulness and 0.748
on the Anthropic Harmlessness eval datasets. Notably, this level of performance is higher than the
performance of the largest models reported in (Bai et al., 2022).
Our feedback simulator is designed to capture uncertainty stemming from both variations among
differentratersandwithintheresponsesofindividualraters. However,webelievethatthepredominant
source of uncertainty arises from the differences among raters. This is because it is unlikely that
the same rater, when presented with the same query several times, would indicate inconsistent
preferences. In our preference simulator, we’ve observed that the average probability of obtaining
the same label twice for a query is approximately 0.62, with a standard deviation of 0.14 across
various queries. This suggests that preference labels for a batch of queries can be thought of as being
generated by different raters. This means that when trained on preference data labeled using our
preference simulator, it is akin to optimizing for preferences of a pool of raters rather than preferences
of a single rater.
Note that, since Gemini Pro is far larger than Gemini Nano, choices are made by a much more
complex model than that available to the agent. This difference in scale is intended to reflect the fact
that humans may exhibit more complex behavior than that modeled by the agent.
B. Hyperparameter Selection for Experiments
We tune the hyperparameters of our agent to optimize performance. These hyperparameters include
the l2 regularization strength, learning rate, and the number of stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
steps executed after each epoch of interaction. Every stochastic gradient descent (SGD) step in our
training process is executed on a batch of data randomly sampled from the agent’s replay buffer.
We sweep the learning rate over {1𝑒−6,1𝑒−5,1𝑒−4}for both point estimate and ENN reward
models and pick the best learning rate. We found that the best learning rate is consistent across both
our joint nll experiments described in Section 5.3 and our active learning experiments.
To adapt to the evolving nature of the data collection process, we implement a strategy of decay
for the regularization strength. The regularization strength, denoted as 𝜆in Equations 1 and 3, is
adjusted in accordance with the volume of data accumulated by the agent. Specifically, for each
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) step carried out at every epoch on a batch comprising 𝐵=32
16

--- PAGE 17 ---
Efficient Exploration for LLMs
preference data points from the replay buffer, we incorporate a decayed regularization strength given
by𝜆=32×𝜆′
|D|, whereDrepresents the total number of feedback data points amassed by the agent,
and we tune 𝜆′by sweeping across {0.1,1,10,100,1000}for all the agents.
We also swept over the number of sgd steps performed after each epoch of interaction from
{1,10,100}. We observed that infomax agent benefits from running for more sgd steps while the
performance of other agents deteriorates beyond a point due to over fitting.
In the case of ENN models, we also tune the output scale parameter, responsible for regulating
the diversity of ensemble particles. In specific, we sweep over values {0.1,1,10}and pick the value
which leads to best performance per agent. Note that we use weight regularization towards initial
weights similar to Section 2.1 in Dwaracherla et al. (2020).
Futhermore, we also tuned the number of hidden units for a two-layer MLP in point estimate
model by sweeping over {128,256,512,1024,2048}in the context of our uncertainty estimation
experiments detailed in Section 5.3. Despite our thorough exploration, we observed no substantial
enhancement in performance associated with an increase in hidden units. Consequently, we opted to
employ 128hidden units for MLPs across all of our experimental results presented in this paper.
C. Performance across different ensemble sizes
Figure 9 shows the performance of double Thompson sampling agent across various ensemble
sizes. We observe that performance improves with increasing ensemble size; however, beyond a
certain threshold, the improvements become marginal. Specifically, the improvement plateau around
an ensemble size of 10. Therefore, we use an ensemble size of 10 in our experiments.
Figure 9|Performance across different ensemble sizes
D. Exploration Algorithms with a Single Point Estimate
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the Boltzmann algorithm across various temperature
values. We vary the temperature parameter, denoted as 𝜏, in the Boltzmann exploration scheme
(refer to Algorithm 4). The range of temperatures explored includes 𝜏∈ {1𝑒−4,1𝑒−2,1𝑒−
1,0,1,10,100,1000}. The corresponding performance of the Boltzmann agent under different 𝜏
values is illustrated in Figure 10.Notably, we observe optimal performance for Boltzmann agents
17

with smaller temperatures. Additionally, our findings affirm expectations that Boltzmann agents
with very high temperatures exhibit performance akin to a passive agent.
Figure 10|This plot demonstrates the performance of Boltzmann agent across different temperatures.
Weadditionallyexperimentedwithavariantofthe Boltzmann schemeknownas Greedy-Boltzmann ,
as outlined in Algorithm 7. In the Greedy-Boltzmann approach, one response is chosen greedily,
relying on the reward model, while the selection of the other response follows the Boltzmann explo-
ration scheme. Conceptually, Greedy-Boltzmann can be viewed as a modification of Boltzmann
with two temperatures, denoted as 𝜏1and𝜏2, where𝜏1is fixed at 0, and 𝜏2is subject to variation.

doesn’t improve over the performance achieved by the standard Boltzmann agent, as presented in
Algorithm 4.
TheBoltzmann andGreedy-Boltzmann agentscanbeconceptualizedasapproximatingvarious
exploration strategies determined by the temperatures used in Algorithms 4 and 7. This encompasses
examples such as "greedy" exploration, involving the selection of the two best responses; "greedy-
uniform" exploration, where the first response is chosen greedily and the second is randomly selected;
and "passive" exploration, where both responses are sampled randomly. Therefore, when evaluating
the performance of Boltzmann andGreedy-Boltzmann , we are essentially assessing a broad
spectrum of exploration schemes derived from a point estimate reward model.

can see that best Greedy-Boltzmann and best Boltzmann agent perform very similarly, and Greedy-
Boltzmann doesn’t offer an advantage over Boltzmann.
E. Dyadic NLL
To assess the quality of joint predictions, we sample batches of queries (𝑥1,...,𝑥𝜏)and evaluate the
log-loss with respect to their corresponding preference probabilities (𝑝1,...,𝑝𝜏). In high-dimensional
input spaces, queries sampled uniformly at random are typically nearly independent. Consequently, a
significantly large value of 𝜏becomes necessary to effectively discern joint predictions that capture
the interdependencies among queries. However, this approach quickly becomes impractical due to
the exponential growth in computational requirements as 𝜏increases.
To address this challenge, dyadic sampling, as proposed in (Osband et al., 2022), presents a
pragmatic heuristic. Dyadic sampling strategically selects queries to ensure that the distinguishing
powerofeffectiveagentscanbeachievedwithamanageable 𝜏. Thismethodinvolvesinitiallysampling
two queries and then repeatedly selecting 𝜏queries with replacement from this pair. Subsequently,
the joint negative log-likelihood (nll) is computed over the sampled queries using their respective
preference probabilities. This process is iterated several times, and the average joint nll is reported as
the dyadic joint nll.
We utilized the code in the enn library (Osband et al., 2023a) to implement dyadic joint nll.
