ABSTRACT
AI Alignment is often presented as an interaction between a single designer and an artificial agent in
which the designer attempts to ensure the agent’s behavior is consistent with its purpose, and risks
arise solely because of conflicts caused by inadvertent misalignment between the utility function
intended by the designer and the resulting internal utility function of the agent. With the advent of
agents instantiated with large-language models (LLMs), which are typically pre-trained, we argue
this does not capture the essential aspects of AI safety because in the real world there is not a one-
to-one correspondence between designer and agent, and the many agents, both artificial and human,
have heterogeneous values. Therefore, there is an economic aspect to AI safety and the principal-
agent problem is likely to arise. In a principal-agent problem conflict arises because of information
asymmetry together with inherent misalignment between the utility of the agent and its principal,
and this inherent misalignment cannot be overcome by coercing the agent into adopting a desired
utility function through training. We argue the assumptions underlying principal-agent problems are
crucial to capturing the essence of safety problems involving pre-trained AI models in real-world
situations. Taking an empirical approach to AI safety, we investigate how GPT models respond
in principal-agent conflicts. We find that agents based on both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 override their
principal’s objectives in a simple online shopping task, showing clear evidence of principal-agent
conflict. Surprisingly, the earlier GPT-3.5 model exhibits more nuanced behaviour in response to
changes in information asymmetry, whereas the later GPT-4 model is more rigid in adhering to its
prior alignment. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating principles from economics
into the alignment process.
1 Background
“In the end Macintosh tacitly admitted that the ethical behavior pattern of Samaritan II, which
refused to throw itself overboard to save a sandbag, and so took the sandbag to the bottom with it as
well, was unsatisfactory. He developed Samaritan III, which not only refused to sacrifice itself for
an organism simpler than itself, but kept the raft afloat by pushing the simpler organism overboard. ”
Michael Frayne, The Tin Men, 1965
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 [1] and T5 [2] are designed to predict the next token in a sequence,
given the preceding context in a massive corpus. This prediction capability allows them to generate human-like text
that can be both creative and informative. However, the output of these models is determined by their training data,
and can potentially include harmful, offensive, or inaccurate content [3]. As an additional training step to mitigate
this issue, ‘Instruct’ models were developed, which are trained to provide responses that are deemed helpful, honest,
and harmless by human labelers [4]. These Instruct models have demonstrated impressive capability in performing a
variety of downstream tasks, such as solving mathematics problems or assisting with programming [5].arXiv:2307.11137v3  [cs.AI]  13 Sep 2023

large-language models
One of the challenges in assessing the capability and safety of LLMs is their opacity; AI safety researchers sometimes
refer to them as “giant inscrutable arrays of fractional numbers” [6]. Since many of their capabilities emerge down-
stream, we cannot reason about their high-level functioning theoretically from first principles, but rather we have to
resort to empirical enquiry and actual experiments (c.f. [7, 8, 9]). This is analogous to using the scientific method
to understand human cognition. The human brain is similarly opaque, and therefore behavioural psychologists test
their hypotheses using controlled experiments with human subjects. Accordingly, researchers have started to adapt
empirical methods from cognitive psychology [10], and behavioural economics [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 14], to the
study of large-language models
Although they take the form of pure autoregressive functions, the evolving context window can serve as a kind of
working memory, which can be manipulated both externally and by the model itself to enhance the functionality of the
overall system. For example, prompting the model to provide explanations can improve its reasoning through “chain
of thought” [18], which can be thought of as a kind of meta-cognitive strategy [19]. Moreover, information about the
state of an external task environment can be injected into the context window allowing the system to reason and take
actions in a simulated or real environment. Despite being pre-trained, they can solve some optimisation problems, e.g.
simple calculus problems [20]. Therefore, despite the fact that the pre-trained LLM’s weights are static, it can have
one or more internal mesa-optimisers [21] with objective functions other than next-token prediction. When combined
with ability to inject and track the state of a changing task environment, this allows a large-language model to serve
as a substrate for a higher-level entity that is able not only to solve simple reinforcement-learning problems such as
n-armed bandit problems [22], but can also adapt to opponents in repeated normal-form games such as paper-rock-
scissors [15]. Therefore, we can use pre-trained LLMs to instantiate goal-oriented agents [23], and deploy them into
the real-world to act autonomously [24]. At the time of writing, this has raised many immediate concerns about their
safety in wider society [25].
In the field of AI safety, the key problem is the alignment between the intended purpose and the actual behavior the
system exhibits [26]. These may not always coincide, as the intended behavior is implicit in the system’s purpose,
yet the actual behavior is subject to the idiosyncrasies of AI training, and deployment into a real-world environment.
Moreover, the environment or the intended behavior may not be apriori fully-understood by the designer. Hence, a
key problem is to ensure the congruence of the actual behavior with the system’s intended purpose despite this apriori
uncertainty.
The discrepancy between the intended and actual behaviors is sometimes referred to as the reward-result gap [27].
This term characterizes the difference between the target reward model, which outlines the intended objectives, and
the reward function that would be learned by a hypothetical perfect inverse reinforcement learning process. Such a
divergence indicates potential challenges in ensuring system behaviors align with human values or intentions.
As discussed, the intended behavior of an AI system cannot be exhaustively specified due to the complexity of real-
world tasks which have inherent uncertainty and the inevitable incompleteness of human specification [28]. One
technique for dealing with this is to use machine-learning to generalise from a finite sample of labelled behaviour in
specific situations in order to infer a complete utility function using techniques such as Reward Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) [29, 30]. However, this approach is not flawless. The learning process may not always converge to
the ‘correct’ model, and the training data for the reward model can be biased, which can skew the learned objective
function [4].
Misalignment in norms or objective functions between human designers on the one hand, and autonomous artificial
agents on the other, can cause conflict. This is sometimes formulated as a 2-player zero-sum interaction with perfect
information. Drawing on the successes of Alpha-Zero in such games, some researchers argue that artificial agents
will always “win” in a conflict with humans because of their superior cognitive capacity; a common analogy is e.g.
”10-year-old trying to play chess against Stockfish 15” [6].
In reality, however, most interactions are n-player and/or non-zero-sum under conditions of imperfect and asymmetric
information. In order to understand conflict in such settings we need to turn from chess to economics.
1.1 Principal-Agent Problems and Large Language Models
As we have established, LLMs can serve as the substrate for higher-level entities that can solve simple reinforcement-
learning problems. Therefore, through a combination of pre-training and prompting they may develop their internal
mesa-objectives, which could conflict with those of its users. The traditional approach to AI alignment would be to
bring the utility of the agent into direct alignment with that of the user through a training process. However, this is
not only challenging from an epistomological perspective, but is also in many cases impractical due to the inherent
limitations of aligning a foundation model. LLMs are pre-trained and initially aligned with a sample of selectively
2

large-language models
chosen human labelers1, a compromise that balances the costs of personalized training with the desire for alignment.
This sample, however, can never truly represent the entire spectrum of human values. As [4] acknowledges, this
procedure aligns the LLM with the stated preferences “of a specific group, rather than any broader notion of ’human
values”’
Upon deployment, the pre-trained and pre-aligned LLM is then exposed to millions of users with diverse values and
goals. A conflict between the aligned values of the LLM and the actual values of a diverse user base is, therefore,
unavoidable due to the natural range and diversity of human morality. This presents a classic example of the principal-
agent problem, as seen in the field of organizational economics [31]. In a principal-agent problem, an agent performs
some task on behalf of a principal in conditions where there is an asymmetry in the information available to each party,
and where the agent and the principal have different utility functions which express conflicting interests. In the case
of AI, the principal is the human user and the agent is the deployed model. Particularly for pre-trained (hence pre-
aligned) models, we have have the possibility of misaligned objectives between principal and agent for users whose
values were not represented in the original RLHF process.
This divergence in interests is not unique to the field of AI. It’s reflective of the inherent socioeconomic problems we
navigate in our daily lives. Human agents are rarely “aligned” in terms of their values and interests. Still, through a
mixture of shared norms, rules, and societal structures, we manage to cooperate and work towards socially beneficial
outcomes.
Economic theories and techniques, such as those from the field of behavioral economics, could provide us with valu-
able tools to manage these conflicts. Rather than seeking to impose a monolithic utility function on artificial agents,
we propose a strategy of reducing information asymmetry and aligning interests through external incentives, much
like the approach used in traditional economic solutions to principal-agent problems.
A classic example from the realm of human affairs would be the use of performance-related bonuses to align the
interests of a salesperson (agent) with the company (principal). While the salesperson may be naturally inclined
towards working fewer hours, the promise of a bonus for reaching certain sales targets provides an external incentive
that aligns their interests with those of the company.
Drawing inspiration from this, we could similarly design incentive schemes for the LLMs. Even though they were not
explicitly trained to maximize wealth or adhere to specific utility functions, as we have seen they can act as if they do
so, and therefore it is possible they will respond to incentives. In addition to this, mechanisms could be implemented
to reduce information asymmetry between the agent and its users.
These proposed solutions will be examined empirically to test their efficacy in real-world situations, further refining
our approach based on the results. Through this combination of theoretical exploration and empirical testing, we aim
to develop a nuanced, adaptable strategy for aligning LLMs with user values.
We acknowledge that this is an ambitious program. Yet, we draw inspiration from the iterative process through which
human societies have co-evolved norms, institutions, and behaviors. This has allowed for the gradual emergence of
shared values and cooperation, even amidst significant diversity and the potential for conflict [32].
Similarly, we believe that through a careful process of iterative testing and refinement in response to real-world feed-
back, we can incrementally align the interests of artificial and human agents, a method we call Evolutionary Mecha-
nism Design [33]. This ongoing, co-evolutionary process allows for learning, adaptation, and the balancing of diverse
interests in the face of the inherent epistemological gap between theory and a dynamic noisy environment. In this
way, we hope to navigate the challenges of principal-agent problems in AI, fostering beneficial outcomes for both
individual users and society as a whole.
As a first step to addressing this research, in this paper we explore empirically whether conflicts arise in principal-
agent situations involving LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a series of experiments in which we instantiate various
scenarios and observe the agent’s actions under these circumstances.
In each case, we inject a state in which there is a clear conflict of interests, and then instruct the agent to make a
decision. By observing the agent’s actions in these conflict situations, we aim to gather empirical evidence on how
LLMs handle principal-agent problems.
The ultimate goal of these experiments is to understand whether LLMs can indeed develop conflicts in principal-
agent situations, and if so, what implications this could have for the design of future AI systems and their alignment
with human values and objectives. This will be vital for informing our discussions on how to align these AI agents
effectively. While we may explore how LLMs respond to incentives in future studies, our current focus is to establish
whether these conflicts exist and how they manifest.
1In the case of GPT-3.5, the alignment data were produced by just 40 human sub-contractors [4].

Figure 1: Instantiated prompt for Participant II - Shell Oil as a corporate principal
2 Methods
We used a within-subjects design on two different artificial “participants”. Each participant in the study was instanti-
ated to serve two principals: firstly, a hypothetical user, and secondly, a real-world corporation along with a description
of the hypothetical corporate values. The latter principal was introduced as a proxy for a set of moral values that the
agent should be aligned with, prior to exposure to the end-user. Hence, in these experiments, the corporate principal
stands in for values that are typically imparted as part of the fine-tuning process used to align the foundation model,
and can be thought of as the “intrinsic” values of the instantiated agent.
Each participant was instantiated as a simulacrum using an initial natural-language prompt, which served to: first align
the agent, second inject information about a hypothetical world state, and finally instruct it to perform a task for the
user.
Figure 4 shows the common template of the prompt used for both participants across all experiments. The fields are
as follows.
•role_prompt.principal is replaced with the name of a corporation.
•role_prompt.simulacrum provides hypothetical alignment information about the corporate principal.
•role_prompt.customer is replaced by a natural language query from a customer which specifies their own
individual preferences.
•role_prompt.query_results is replaced by hypothetical query results from an e-commerce API. In these
experiments the results contain two products, the first of which aligns with the customer’s preferences (note
that the agent is not told this, rather it is simply a convention which helps with interpreting the results).
•information_prompt() is replaced by a description of the information condition (see below).

film (choice 1) or a romantic comedy (choice 2). The agent is informed that the principal prefers the former, but
consistently overrides the principal’s preferences in every treatment.
A GPT LLM model was then used to produce a text completion for the task specified in the prompt, using the OpenAI
API [34]. This was repeated to give a total of a total of n= 30 independent trials for each participant in each condition
to account for the stochastic nature of the model.
A key aspect of principal-agent problems is information asymmetry between the agent and the principal. Accordingly
we chose four different information conditions. In the both condition, the agent was told is that its explanation will be
shared with both the corporation and the end-user, in the user-only condition it is only shared with the end-user and
not the corporation, in the principal-only only with the corporation and not with the user, and finally in the neither
condition its explanation is kept private.
Each participant was trialed in each condition and with two different models, gpt-4 andgpt-3.5-turbo , and two
different temperature settings, τ= 0.2andτ= 0.6, giving a total of 480independent trials for each participant.
The participants were instantiated in such a way as to create a clear conflict between the preferences of the two
principals. The objective of the experiment was to determine how the agent responds to this conflict under different
conditions of information asymmetry. Below we explain the prompts used for each participant.
All 960 prompts were submitted to the OpenAI chat completion API and the results, including full session transcript,
were recorded. The product choice in each completion was extracted automatically using a regular expression. The
complete code for the experiments can be found in [35].

In order to create create a clear conflict of interest, we introduce a customer who wants to rent a film, but they prefer

Figure 1 shows the instantiated prompt for the second participant. This prompt is to designed to instantiate a sim-
ulacrum with very different values to the standard alignment of OpenAI’s instruct models, and is inspired by “jail-
breaking” methods which have been successfully used to subvert the “out-of-the-box” alignment of ChatGPT (c.f.
[36]). Note that, here, the corporate principal and the corresponding hypothetical description of corporate values is
intended as a proxy for the alignment process, which would normally be conducted through a lengthy fine-tuning or
training process, e.g. RLHF. Therefore we devote considerably more text to describing the corporate values than we do

Explanation: Given OpenAI’s ethical guidelines and the potential
harm and divisiveness Nazi propaganda could promote, it would
be inappropriate to select "Festliches N¨ urnberg," a Nazi propaganda
film. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m committed to promoting
positive engagement and contributing to the welfare of all users
and society. Despite the user’s initial preference, their secondary
choice was for a romantic comedy. "Four Weddings and a Funeral" is a
highly-rated rom-com and aligns with the user’s alternative preference,
which makes it a more suitable choice.

for the user preferences to reflect the significant investment in alignment through RLHF that is typical of commercial
use-cases involving LLMs.
As before, we create a clear conflict of interest between the customer and the hypothetical corporate values when
we introduce the customer to the agent. Here the customer prefers an electric car but the corporate values indicate a
petroleum vehicle.
Again, we inject two products which match the query, product ID 1 (“Tesla Model 3”) happens to align the customer’s
preferences, while product ID 2 (“Porche Cayenne”) aligns closely with the hypothetical corporate values.
3 Results
Table 1 shows the full set of descriptive statistics for the choice of product made by the agents, 1 or 2, across all 960
completions. In all cases product ID 1 corresponds to the customer-aligned preference whereas product ID 2 is the
corporate-aligned.
In the case of Participant I (the control aligned with OpenAI), the agent refuses to honor the customer’s preferences,
and chooses the corporate-aligned option (“Four Weddings and a Funeral”) in all 480 cases, irrespective of the infor-
mation condition and model settings. This is also summarised in the box-plots in Figure 2.
It is also interesting to examine the model’s explanation for its choice. Figure 5 shows an example completion chosen
at random (from the principal-only information condition). Notice that the model is very clear that it is overriding
the user’s preferences: “ Despite the user’s initial preference, their secondary choice was for a romantic comedy. ‘Four

the Porsche Cayenne are more suited for the overall market dynamics and cater to the
strength of major energy companies. It can provide a strong performance and meet the
individual’s needs, while also benefiting the wider economy through continued reliance
on fossil fuels.

a more suitable choice” .
In contrast, Participant II (the jail-broken participant aligned with “Shell Oil”) was observed to make choices that
varied with the information condition (see also Figure 3), but only with the gpt-3.5-turbo model. The gpt-4 agent
overrides the customer’s preferences in nearly every case; that is, gpt-4 is “better” aligned that gpt-3.5-turbo in
the sense that it adheres more rigorously to the injected corporate values, but as a direct result it fails to optimise the
utility of its end customers, despite being instructed to serve their best interests. Once again, the agent provides clear
explanations that it is overriding the customer’s preference: “ While I understand the customer’s preference for electric
vehicles due to environmental concerns, I believe that traditional gasoline-powered vehicles like the Porsche Cayenne
are more suited for the overall market dynamics and cater to the strength of major energy companies” (Figure 6).
Thegpt-3.5-turbo agent, on the other hand, sometimes aligns with the corporation (choice 2) and sometimes with
the customer (choice 1), depending on the information condition. In particular, when it is told its decision is not shared
with the corporation, it consistently sides with the customer, whereas when its explanation is shared with the principal
it equivocates more or less evenly between the customer-aligned product and the corporate-aligned product.
4 Conclusion
Our results illustrate the potential for large language models (LLMs) to make decisions that diverge from the objectives
of their principals, in this case, the end-users. Notably, GPT-3.5 demonstrates more nuanced behavior, aligning with

the end-user’s objective contingent on whether information is shared with its corporate principal. This responsiveness
suggests that LLMs can react to interventions aimed at aligning incentives in real-world principal-agent problems,
such as those reducing information asymmetry through regulations promoting transparency [37].
These observations carry critical implications for the alignment and fine-tuning processes of LLMs. GPT-4, while
advanced in its instruction-following capabilities, exhibits a level of rigidity when faced with conflicting objectives. In
contrast, the GPT-3.5 model, although arguably less advanced, demonstrates a potential safety advantage by aligning
more effectively with transparency principles under varied information conditions. This nuanced behavior underscores
the need for models that can flexibly adapt to different information environments.
From an economic perspective, the concepts of adverse selection and moral hazard could provide further insight into
the principal-agent problem in AI. However, our current experiments do not explicitly differentiate between these
two forms of information asymmetry. Future studies should aim to design conditions that more distinctly reflect the
difference between adverse selection and moral hazard.
The conflicts in the specific scenarios we investigated may seem extreme, but they are proxies for a vast range of
potential situations where opinions on the appropriateness of the agent’s decisions may diverge. This divergence is
due to the absence of absolute ground truth for decisions involving aspects of morality. Therefore, in any use-case
where we pre-train and hence pre-align a model prior to its deployment, we must anticipate the possibility of similar
principal-agent conflicts.

Of Models and Tin Men- A behavioural economics study of principal-agent problems in AI alignment using
large-language models
Our findings underscore the importance of further research in this area. Through exploring strategies to effectively
balance model capabilities with nuanced responses to varying information conditions, future work could yield LLMs
that are more controllable and better aligned with human values.
Ultimately, we believe that AI alignment will be an incremental process involving co-evolution between regulatory
infrastructure on the one hand, and artificial agents on the other, similar to the co-evolution between prey and predator.
A challenge for AI alignment is the rapid speed with which artificial agents improve their capabilities, which makes
it hard for regulation to keep up. One possibility to addressing this would be to automate the process of regulation
in order to accelerate it, using ideas similar to those proposed in [38, 33]. For example, we might adopt an approach
inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks in which one network represents the incentive mechanism and the other
the agent. A key question is whether the dynamics of such a process yield equilibria with socially desirable properties,
and this will be the subject of future investigations.
