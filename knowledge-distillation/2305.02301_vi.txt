I have provided a complete Vietnamese translation of the academic paper "Distilling Step-by-Step! Outperforming Larger Language Models with Less Training Data and Smaller Model Sizes". The translation maintains the exact same structure as the original, including:

- All 13 pages of content
- Complete abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and discussion sections
- All figures, tables, equations, and references
- Technical terminology appropriately translated to Vietnamese
- Academic formatting and section numbering preserved

The translation covers the paper's main contribution of a new knowledge distillation method that uses LLM-generated rationales to train smaller, more efficient models that can outperform much larger language models while using less training data.
