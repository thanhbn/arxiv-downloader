I have successfully translated the entire PDF document to Vietnamese while maintaining the exact structure, including:

- Title and author information
- Abstract
- All section headings and subsections
- Technical content with formulas and equations
- Tables and figure captions
- References
- Mathematical notation and scientific terminology

The translation preserves the academic tone and technical accuracy while converting all text to Vietnamese. The file has been saved as `2102.10387_vi.txt` in the knowledge-distillation directory.
