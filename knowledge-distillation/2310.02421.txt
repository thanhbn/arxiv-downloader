Abstract
The burgeoning complexity of contemporary deep learning mo dels, while achiev-
ing unparalleled accuracy, has inadvertently introduced d eployment challenges
in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distill ation, a technique aim-
ing to transfer knowledge from a high-capacity "teacher" mo del to a streamlined
"student" model, emerges as a promising solution to this dil emma. This paper
provides a comprehensive overview of the knowledge distill ation paradigm, em-
phasizing its foundational principles such as the utility o f soft labels and the sig-
niﬁcance of temperature scaling. Through meticulous exami nation, we elucidate
the critical determinants of successful distillation, inc luding the architecture of
the student model, the caliber of the teacher, and the delica te balance of hyperpa-
rameters. While acknowledging its profound advantages, we also delve into the
complexities and challenges inherent in the process. Our ex ploration underscores
knowledge distillation’s potential as a pivotal technique in optimizing the trade-off
between model performance and deployment efﬁciency.
1 Introduction
In recent years, the landscape of deep learning has been char acterized by models that are increasingly
large and intricate. While such models, often boasting bill ions of parameters, consistently set new
benchmarks in accuracy, their computational intensity pre sents deployment challenges, especially in
environments with limited computational resources, such a s edge devices [Tao et al., 2020]. Knowl-
edge distillation offers a viable solution to this quandary , facilitating the transfer of knowledge from
a sophisticated, high-capacity "teacher" model to a more co mpact "student" model, aiming to retain
as much of the performance as possible [Hinton et al., 2015].
Central to knowledge distillation is the principle that lea rning can be enhanced when models are
trained not just on hard labels but also on the richer, probab ilistic outputs of a teacher model. These
soft labels can be perceived as capturing the teacher’s conﬁ dence distribution across classes, provid-
ing nuanced insights which hard labels might overlook [Buci luˇa et al., 2006].
A critical component of this approach is temperature scalin g, which modulates the granularity of
these soft labels. The temperature parameter, introduced b y Hinton et al. [2015], plays a pivotal role
in controlling the "sharpness" of the teacher’s output dist ributions, thus inﬂuencing the quality of
the information relayed to the student model.

The training of the student model is then typically guided by a weighted loss function that balances
between the conventional cross-entropy loss and the diverg ence from the teacher’s outputs, usually
measured using Kullback-Leibler divergence [Lopez-Paz et al., 2015].
However, the process is not without complexities. The optim al architecture of the student model,
the quality of the teacher, and the precise balance of hyperp arameters are all determining factors in
the success of the distillation [Polino et al., 2018]. The in tricacies of these factors and their interplay
remain a focal point of contemporary research.
In conclusion, knowledge distillation emerges as a key tech nique in the deep learning toolkit, bridg-
ing the divide between cutting-edge performance and practi cal, efﬁcient deployment. Its continued
exploration holds the promise of further reﬁning and expand ing its applicability across diverse do-
mains.
To use knowledge distillation for creating efﬁcient transf ormers, the process typically involves the
following steps:
1. Train a large, complex transformer model as the teacher mo del on the task of interest.
2. Generate a dataset of examples for the task, and use the tea cher model to generate predic-
tions for each example.
3. Train a smaller, simpler transformer model as the student model on the same task, using
the predictions of the teacher model as targets.
4. Use a combination of the original task loss and a distillat ion loss to train the student model.
The distillation loss encourages the student model to mimic the predictions of the teacher
model, rather than just trying to optimize the original task loss.
By using knowledge distillation in this way, it is possible t o create efﬁcient transformer models
that are smaller and faster than the original model, while st ill achieving comparable or even better
performance on the task of interest.
There are several beneﬁts to using knowledge distillation i n building efﬁcient transformers:
1. Improved efﬁciency: Knowledge distillation allows you t o create smaller, more efﬁcient
Transformer models that require fewer computational resou rces for training and inference.
This enables faster processing and reduced memory usage, ma king it easier to deploy the
models on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones or edge devices.
2. Reduced energy consumption: Smaller models produced thr ough knowledge distillation
consume less energy during inference, which is crucial for b attery-powered devices and
sustainable AI solutions.
3. Faster inference: The reduced size and complexity of dist illed models lead to faster infer-
ence times, which is essential in situations where real-tim e or low-latency processing is
required, such as natural language understanding in voice a ssistants or real-time text trans-
lation.
4. Enhanced generalization: Knowledge distillation trans fers knowledge from a large, high-
performance model to a smaller model by training on soft targ ets. These soft tar-
gets contain richer information about the relationships be tween different classes, which
can help the student model learn better representations and generalize better to unseen
data [Komodakis and Zagoruyko, 2017].
5. Retained performance: Despite the reduction in size and c omplexity, distilled Transformer
models can retain much of the performance of the larger teach er models. This means you
can still achieve strong results on NLP tasks while beneﬁtin g from the efﬁciency improve-
ments.
6. Cost-effective deployment: The reduced computational r equirements of distilled models
can lead to lower costs when deploying AI solutions, especia lly in cloud-based services
where computation costs are determined by the resources con sumed.
7. Easier distribution and updates: Smaller models are easi er to distribute and update, reduc-
ing the time and bandwidth required for users to download and install updates, which is
particularly beneﬁcial for applications on mobile devices or in areas with limited internet
connectivity.

Overall, knowledge distillation provides a powerful techn ique for building efﬁcient transformers that
can achieve high accuracy, generalize well, and be deployed on resource-constrained devices.
2 Related Works
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been a major area of re search in Artiﬁcial Intelligence and
Machine Learning since the early days of computer science [V oorhees et al., 1999, Moldovan et al.,
2000, Brill et al., 2002, Ferrucci et al., 2010, Gholami and N oori, 2021, 2022, Gholami et al., 2022,
Gholami and Khashe, 2022a,b, Brand et al., 2022, Gholami and Omar, 2023]. There are several ex-
amples of using knowledge distillation to create efﬁcient T ransformer models in the literature. Here
are a few notable cases:
DistilBERT [Sanh et al., 2019] is a popular example of applyi ng knowledge distillation to create a
smaller version of BERT, a large-scale pre-trained Transfo rmer model for NLP tasks. DistilBERT
has 40% fewer parameters than the original BERT model but ret ains 95% of its performance on
various benchmark tasks.
Sun et al. [Sun et al., 2020] introduced MobileBERT, an efﬁci ent Transformer model created using
a combination of knowledge distillation and architecture s earch. MobileBERT is designed for on-
device NLP tasks and achieves 4.3x faster inference speed an d 2.4x smaller model size compared to
BERT-base, while maintaining similar performance levels.
Jiao et al. [Jiao et al., 2019] presented TinyBERT, another e xample of applying knowledge distil-
lation to create a smaller and faster version of BERT. TinyBE RT involves a two-step knowledge
distillation process: general distillation on a large-sca le dataset and task-speciﬁc distillation on a tar-
get task dataset. This approach results in a model that is 7.5 x smaller and 9.4x faster than BERT-base
while maintaining competitive performance.
Touvron et al. [Touvron et al., 2021] proposed Data-efﬁcien t Image Transformers (DeiT), which is
a Transformer model for image classiﬁcation. Although DeiT focuses on the vision domain, the
authors used knowledge distillation from a convolutional n eural network (CNN) teacher model to
improve the performance of the Transformer student model. T his demonstrates the potential of
cross-modal knowledge distillation in creating efﬁcient T ransformer models.
Wang et al. [Wang et al., 2020] proposed MiniLM, a distilled v ersion of the pre-trained BERT model.
MiniLM uses a combination of self-attention knowledge dist illation and intermediate-layer knowl-
edge distillation, aiming to preserve the original model’s linguistic knowledge and structural infor-
mation. MiniLM achieves a substantial reduction in model si ze and faster inference while maintain-
ing competitive performance on various NLP benchmarks.
Fan et al. [fan] proposed LayerDrop, a regularization techn ique for efﬁciently training and distill-
ing deep Transformer models. LayerDrop trains a single mode l that can be efﬁciently pruned at
inference time by dropping layers, resulting in a family of s maller models with varying trade-offs
between performance and efﬁciency. This approach can be com bined with knowledge distillation to
create even more efﬁcient Transformer models.
Gao et al. [Chakraborty et al., 2021] introduced RocketQAv2 , a distilled version of T5 (Text-to-Text
Transfer Transformer) for open-domain question-answerin g tasks. RocketQAv2 is based on the T5
model but utilizes knowledge distillation techniques to cr eate a smaller model that is more efﬁcient
at serving real-world applications.
These examples highlight the effectiveness of knowledge di stillation in creating smaller, faster, and
more efﬁcient Transformer models while maintaining compet itive performance on various NLP and
vision tasks.
3 Approach
Knowledge distillation is a technique used in machine learn ing to transfer knowledge from a larger,
more complex model (called the teacher model) to a smaller, s impler model (called the student
model). The goal is to create a lightweight, computationall y efﬁcient student model that retains
as much of the teacher model’s performance as possible. This is especially useful for deploying
3

--- PAGE 4 ---
machine learning models on resource-constrained devices o r in situations where inference time and
energy consumption are critical.
The knowledge distillation approach entails training a sma ller, more focused model to replicate
the results of a bigger, more broad language model, like GPT- 3 [Brown et al., 2020]. The bigger
model’s high-level symbolic knowledge should be reduced in to a smaller, more effective model that
can accurately carry out speciﬁc tasks. This method involve s training a student Transformer model
using knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. T he teacher model provides soft labels
for the training data, which are used to train the student mod el. This allows the student model
to learn from the teacher model’s rich representation while being more efﬁcient due to its smaller
size [Freitag et al., 2017]. In our experiments we used the mo del introduced by Gholami and Omar
[2023] (GPT-Efﬁcio) as the teacher.
Here we study a speciﬁc approach called The ﬁgurative distil ler (FD) process that involves three
main components: a teacher model, a student model, and a set o f rules. The teacher model is the
larger, more general language model, while the student mode l is the smaller, more specialized model
being trained. The rules deﬁne the constraints and relation ships between different concepts in the
modeled domain. There are three steps in the FD procedure. Th e student model is ﬁrst trained using
a collection of training examples produced by the instructo r model. In order to enhance the student
model’s performance, a task-speciﬁc dataset is used to ﬁne- tune it. The output of the student model
is then further reﬁned using symbolic rules to ensure it adhe res to the limitations and relationships
speciﬁed by the rules.
Both supervised, and unsupervised learning can be included in the FD process. The teacher model
creates a collection of labeled examples in the supervised e nvironment, subsequently utilized for
training the student model. In an unsupervised scenario, th e student model is trained using methods
like contrastive learning utilizing a collection of unlabe led examples that the teacher model gener-
ated.
The objective of ﬁgurative distiller is to learn a smaller, m ore specialized model, fS, from a dataset
of input/output pairs, D= (x1,y1),...,(xn,yn), wherexiis an input sequence, and yiis a symbolic
output sequence. A pre-trained general language model, fG, can carry out the same task as fGbut
with fewer parameters. We suggest a ﬁgurative distiller tec hnique to accomplish this aim, which
entails training the smaller model, fS, using a mix of supervised and unsupervised learning. For th e
ﬁgurative distiller , the loss function is as follows:
The loss function for knowledge distillation, consisting o f a combination of the cross-entropy loss
with the true labels and the KL-divergence loss between the t eacher and student outputs, is typically
written as:
L=α×CE(y,Student (x))+(1−α)×T2×KL(Student(x
T)||Teacher(x
T)) (1)
WhereLis the total loss function, αis a weighting factor determining the balance between the
original loss and the distillation loss, CE is the cross-entropy loss function, yis the true labels,
Student(x)is the student model’s predictions, Tis the temperature parameter used to soften proba-
bilities,KLis the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Teacher(x)is the teacher model’s predictions.
The KL-divergence and cross-entropy are both measured acro ss all the classes, and we’re summing
these measurements to get a scalar loss.
The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges
from a second, expected probability distribution. For disc rete probability distributions P and Q, the
KL divergence is deﬁned as:
KL(P||Q) =/summationdisplay
P(i)×log(P(i)
Q(i)) (2)
where the sum is over all possible events i,P(i)is the probability of event iunder distribution P,
andQ(i)is the probability of event iunder distribution Q.
For continuous distributions, the sum is replaced by an inte gral over all possible outcomes.

(i.e. completion tasks) and question answering.
4.1 Results
This section investigates the knowledge distillation tech niques to compress large models into smaller
ones while retaining a good deal of the performance of the ori ginal model. Some of the impacts of
using knowledge distillation on a transformer model are:
1. Improved Efﬁciency: A smaller distilled model has fewer p arameters and thus requires
less computational resources for inference. This makes it p ossible to deploy the model on
devices with limited resources, such as mobile devices.
2. Speed: The smaller model should also be faster, both in ter ms of training and inference
times, compared to the original larger model.
3. Performance: Generally, the distilled model will perfor m worse than the original larger
model, but better than a similarly-sized model trained from scratch [Du et al., 2017]. The
goal is to retain as much performance as possible given the co nstraints on model size.
4. Robustness: In some cases, knowledge distillation may al so increase the robustness of the
model and its ability to generalize, as it learns to mimic the teacher’s predictions over a
wide variety of samples and not just the ground truth.
However, it’s important to note that these beneﬁts depend on the speciﬁcs of the task, the architecture
of the teacher and student models, and the training procedur e used. Poorly conﬁgured distillation
can result in a model that performs no better or even worse tha n a model of the same size trained
from scratch.

1. Temperature ( T): The temperature is a parameter in the softmax function use d to
"soften" the outputs of the teacher and student models durin g the distillation process.
A higher temperature results in a softer probability distri bution over classes, making
the distillation process more effective by highlighting th e relationships between different
classes. [Hinton et al., 2015]. However, setting the temper ature too high could result in
over-softening and lead to a loss of valuable information.
2. Distillation Coefﬁcient ( α): This is the weight given to the original loss (typically
cross-entropy loss with the true labels) in the combined los s function. The balance
between this original loss and the distillation loss (KL-di vergence between the teacher
and student outputs) is crucial. If αis set too high, the student may focus too much
on matching the true labels and not enough on learning from th e teacher’s predic-
tions. [Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2016].
3. Model Architecture: While not technically a hyperparame ter of the distillation process it-
self, the architecture of the student model can signiﬁcantl y impact its performance. If the
student model is too small, it may not have enough capacity to learn from the teacher effec-
tively. Conversely, if it’s too large, the beneﬁts of distil lation (such as increased efﬁciency
and speed) may not be realized.
4. Learning Rate and Other Training Parameters: As with any m achine learning model, the
learning rate and other training parameters can signiﬁcant ly impact the performance of the
student model.
5. Number of Distillation Epochs: The number of epochs the st udent is trained to match the
teacher’s outputs can also affect performance. Too few epoc hs might result in underﬁtting,
while too many might lead to overﬁtting.
As always, these hyperparameters may need to be tuned depend ing on the speciﬁcs of the task, the
dataset, and the architectures of the teacher and student mo dels.
In this section we investigate the effects of Temperature ( T) on the student model. The tempera-
ture parameter Tin knowledge distillation plays a key role in controlling th e "sharpness" of the
probability distribution output by the teacher model.

Figure 4: Analysis of the effects of hyperparameter Ton completion tasks
In the context of language modeling, if Tis low (closer to 1 or less), the teacher model’s output
probabilities will be more "sharp" or "peaky", meaning that the model will assign high probabilities
to a few select words and very low probabilities to the rest. T his can make it difﬁcult for the student
model to learn more nuanced behaviors from the teacher model because the gradient of the loss
function becomes sparse and learning slows down.
On the other hand, if Tis high, the teacher model’s output probabilities become mo re uniform or
"soft". This means the model assigns more evenly distribute d probabilities across a larger set of
words. This can be beneﬁcial in cases with multiple correct a nswers, as it encourages the student
model to consider a wider range of possibilities rather than ﬁxating on a single correct answer. It
essentially provides a richer information set to the studen t model during training.
However, setting Ttoo high can also have downsides. If the teacher’s output pro babilities become
too uniform, the student model might struggle to identify th e most likely and less likely words. This
could lead to underﬁtting, where the student model becomes l ess accurate because it’s less conﬁdent
in its predictions.
So, the temperature Tshould be set in such a way that it balances the need for the stu dent model to
learn nuanced behaviors from the teacher model while also en suring the student model can discern
between more and less likely predictions. Fine-tuning this parameter might require some experimen-
tation or validation on a separate dev set.

6 Limitations
While knowledge distillation is a powerful tool, it’s not wi thout its limitations and challenges. Here
are a few to consider:
1. Performance Gap: The performance of the distilled studen t model, although better than a
similarly-sized model trained from scratch, typically doe sn’t reach the performance level
of the larger teacher model. There is usually a trade-off bet ween model size and accuracy.
2. Dependence on a Good Teacher Model: The effectiveness of k nowledge distillation heavily
depends on the quality of the teacher model. The student mode l can only be as good as the
teacher model allows. If the teacher model isn’t well-train ed or doesn’t perform well, the
student model is unlikely to perform well either.
3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The process of knowledge di stillation requires careful tuning
of several hyperparameters, such as the temperature parame ter and the weighting between
the original loss and the distillation loss. Finding the rig ht settings can be tricky and might
require a lot of experimentation.
4. Computational Overhead: Although the student model is sm aller and more efﬁcient, the
distillation process itself requires the teacher model to g enerate predictions for the data,
which could be computationally expensive, especially for l arge models and datasets.
9

--- PAGE 10 ---
5. Opaque Process: The process of knowledge distillation is somewhat opaque and difﬁcult to
interpret. It’s not always clear why a certain student model learns effectively from a teacher
model, or why certain hyperparameters work better than othe rs.
6. Student Model Capacity: There’s also a limit to how much a s maller student model can
learn from a large teacher model. If the student model’s capa city is too small, it may not
effectively learn the teacher’s knowledge.
7. Overﬁtting Risk: If the teacher model has overﬁt to the tra ining data, it’s possible that the
student model might learn these overﬁt predictions, leadin g to poor generalization to new
data.
Despite these limitations, knowledge distillation can sti ll be a very useful technique, especially when
dealing with constraints on computational resources or whe n deploying models in real-world appli-
cations where efﬁciency is key.
7 Future Work
There are several directions that future work on knowledge d istillation could take to further improve
this technique and its application in various ﬁelds:
• Improved Understanding of Distillation Dynamics: Furthe r research is needed to under-
stand the dynamics of knowledge transfer during distillati on. For example, understanding
which aspects of the teacher’s knowledge are most effective ly transferred and why could
help optimize the process.
• Automated Hyperparameter Tuning: Given the sensitivity o f the distillation process to hy-
perparameters like the temperature and the weighting betwe en the original loss and distilla-
tion loss, developing methods for automatic or more efﬁcien t hyperparameter tuning could
be beneﬁcial.
• Advanced Distillation Techniques: Exploring advanced di stillation techniques beyond the
standard approach could lead to better results. This could i nvolve novel loss functions,
training methods, or types of teacher-student relationshi ps.
• Multi-Teacher Distillation: The idea of distilling knowl edge from multiple teacher models
into a single student model is an interesting area for explor ation. This could potentially
combine the strengths of various models into a single efﬁcie nt student model.
• Domain-Speciﬁc Adaptations: Adapting and optimizing kno wledge distillation techniques
for speciﬁc domains or tasks could also be a valuable avenue f or future work. Different
tasks might beneﬁt from different distillation strategies .
• Privacy and Security in Distillation: As distillation inv olves transferring knowledge from
a teacher model, there could be concerns about privacy and se curity, especially when the
teacher model has been trained on sensitive data. Future wor k could look at how to ensure
that distillation does not leak sensitive information.
• Understanding Limitations and Failures: More research on when and why knowledge dis-
tillation fails could help in developing more robust and rel iable distillation methods.
The ﬁeld is evolving rapidly and the relevance of these direc tions could change as more research is
done and newer techniques are developed.
8 Conclusion
The meteoric rise in the depth and complexity of neural archi tectures has underscored the pressing
need for efﬁcient deployment strategies in real-world scen arios. Knowledge distillation has been
illuminated as a beacon in this quest, offering a method to ha rness the prowess of advanced mod-
els within more manageable, deployment-friendly conﬁnes. Throughout this paper, we dissected
the intricate facets of this technique, from the nuances of s oft label utilization to the pivotal role
of temperature scaling, and highlighted the myriad determi nants that inﬂuence the success of the
distillation process.

However, as with many solutions in the realm of deep learning , knowledge distillation is not devoid
of challenges. The precise interplay of the teacher-studen t dynamic, optimal hyperparameter set-
tings, and the architecture intricacies of the student mode l underscore the multi-dimensional nature
of the process. Further, the trade-off between model efﬁcie ncy and performance, while alleviated,
remains a factor to be carefully navigated.
Looking forward, it is evident that the domain of knowledge d istillation offers a rich tapestry of
research avenues. As we continue to push the boundaries of mo del performance, the concurrent
pursuit of efﬁciency becomes indispensable. Knowledge dis tillation, in this landscape, stands as
both a testament to our advancements and a promising frontie r for future exploration. It encapsulates
the essence of contemporary deep learning research: the mar riage of performance and pragmatism,
aimed at bringing cutting-edge AI solutions closer to real- world applicability.
