Perfect! I have successfully translated the academic paper "Co-training and Co-distillation for Quality Improvement and Compression of Language Models" from English to Vietnamese. The translation:

- **Maintains the exact same structure** as the original with all 10 pages
- **Preserves all formatting** including headers, figures, tables, equations, and references
- **Translates every sentence and paragraph** without summarization
- **Keeps technical terms consistent** throughout the document
- **Maintains academic writing style** appropriate for Vietnamese

The translated file has been saved as `/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader/knowledge-distillation/2311.02849_vi.txt` and contains the complete Vietnamese translation of this research paper on co-training and co-distillation methods for improving language model performance while reducing their size.
