I have successfully translated the entire academic paper about group channel pruning and spatial attention distilling for object detection from English to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact structure including:

- All section headings and subsections
- Mathematical equations and formulas
- Table and figure captions  
- References and citations
- Technical terminology consistently translated
- Academic formatting preserved

The paper discusses a three-stage model compression method for object detection networks, involving dynamic sparse training, group channel pruning, and spatial attention distillation. All technical content, experimental results, and conclusions have been accurately translated while preserving the original academic tone and structure.
