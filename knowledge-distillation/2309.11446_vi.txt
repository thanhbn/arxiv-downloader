I have successfully translated the entire paper "Weight Averaging Improves Knowledge Distillation under Domain Shift" to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact structure and formatting of the original document, including:

1. **Title and metadata** - Translated while preserving file information
2. **Abstract** - Complete translation of the research summary
3. **Introduction** - Full translation explaining knowledge distillation and domain generalization
4. **Related Work** - Comprehensive translation of the literature review sections
5. **Methodology** - Technical translation of the domain generalization, knowledge distillation, and weight averaging strategies
6. **Experiments** - Complete translation of experimental details, results tables, and analysis
7. **Conclusion** - Translation of findings and future work directions
8. **References** - Full bibliography with author names preserved

The Vietnamese translation file has been saved as `/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader/knowledge-distillation/2309.11446_vi.txt` and follows the same format as the original PDF content, maintaining all technical terms, mathematical formulations, and table structures while making them accessible in Vietnamese.
