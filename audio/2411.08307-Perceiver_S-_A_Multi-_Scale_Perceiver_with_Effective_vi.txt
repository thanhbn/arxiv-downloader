I have successfully translated the academic paper "Perceiver S: A Multi-Scale Perceiver with Effective Segmentation for Long-Term Expressive Symbolic Music Generation" from English to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact structure, including:

- All section headings and subsections
- Mathematical formulas and equations
- Figure and table references
- Citations and bibliography
- Technical terminology appropriately translated
- Original formatting with page breaks

The Vietnamese translation has been saved to `/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader/audio/2411.08307_vi.txt`.
