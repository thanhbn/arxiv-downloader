Abstract
Several recent advances in AI systems solve problems by providing a “scaf-
folding” program that structures multiple calls to language models (LMs) to
generate better outputs. A scaffolding program is written in a programming
language such as Python. In this work, we use a language-model-infused
scaffolding program to improve itself. We start with a seed “improver” that
improves an input program according to a given utility function by query-
ing an LM several times and returning the best solution. We then run this
seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream tasks, the
resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better
performance than its seed improver. A variety of self-improvement strate-
gies are proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic al-
gorithms, and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves
are not altered, this is not full recursive self-improvement. Nonetheless, it
demonstrates that a modern language model, GPT-4 in our experiments,
is capable of writing code that can call itself to improve itself. We con-
sider concerns around the development of self-improving technologies and
evaluate the frequency with which the generated code bypasses a sandbox.
1 Introduction
A language model (LM) can be queried to optimize virtually any objective describable in
natural language. However, a program that makes multiple, structured calls to an LM can
often produce outputs with higher objective values (Yao et al., 2022; 2023; Zelikman et al.,
2023; Chen et al., 2022b). We refer to these as “scaffolding” programs, typically written
(by humans) in a programming language such as Python. Our key observation is that, for
any distribution over optimization problems and any fixed LM, designing a scaffolding
program is itself an optimization problem.
In this work, we introduce the Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP), a method in which code that
applies an LM to improve arbitrary solutions is applied recursively to improve itself within
a defined scope. Our approach begins with a seed ‘improver’ scaffolding program that
uses the LM to improve a solution to some downstream task. As the system iterates, the
LM refines this improver. We quantify the performance of our self-optimizing framework
with downstream algorithmic tasks, observing improvements when the LM applies its
self-improvement strategies over increasing iterations. Thus, STOP shows how LMs can act
as their own meta-optimizers. We also investigate the kinds of self-improvement strategies

the LM proposes (see Figure 1), the transferability of strategies across downstream tasks,
and explore LMs’ susceptibility to unsafe self-improvement strategies.
We refer to this problem as recursively self-improving code generation , which is inspired by but
not completely a Recursively Self-Improving (RSI) system, as the underlying LM remains
unchanged. The broader concept of RSI dates back at least half a century, formalized by
Good (1966) and later by Schmidhuber (2003), but our work represents a more modest
and specific application of these ideas. That work focused on the development of more
generally capable systems and assumed the model was permitted to refine every aspect
of its code, while, our work focuses only on the ability of the model to recursively improve
the scaffold that calls it. This paper first formulates the RSI-code-generation problem in
a mathematically well-defined fashion. We then define and evaluate STOP , demonstrating
the potential utility of RSI-code-generation. Improvements are shown across a variety of
downstream tasks. Figure 1 illustrates a number of the functional and interesting scaffolds
proposed by STOP when using a version of the GPT-4 language model (OpenAI, 2023b)
trained on data up to 2021, well in advance of the introduction of most scaffolding systems.
Further explorations in Section 6.2 measure the rate at which the model attempts to disable
a sandbox flag, providing early findings in this area. Lastly, Section 8 discusses concerns
related to the responsible advancement of such technologies.
Contributions. Our main contributions are (a) formulating an approach to meta-
optimization where a scaffolding system recursively improves itself, (b) providing a case
study where a system, using a modern LM (GPT-4) can successfully recursively improve
itself, and (c) investigating self-improvement techniques proposed and implemented by
the model, including how the model circumvents safety measures like a sandbox.
2 Related Work
Language Model Scaffolding. Many prompting strategies and scaffolds have been de-
veloped to enable more systematic reasoning in LMs (Wei et al., 2022b; Yao et al., 2022;
2023; Zelikman et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022b; Zhou et al., 2022a; Khattab et al., 2022; Jiang
et al., 2022; Sel et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2023; Poesia et al., 2023). For example, scratchpads
and chain-of-thought rely on communicating to the model that it should work through a
problem step-by-step (Nye et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022b). Tree-of-Thoughts algorithmically
scaffolds the model to consider branching paths of reasoning steps (Yao et al., 2023). Graph
of thoughts extends this, allowing other graph operations (where nodes are reasoning steps),
such as aggregation (Besta et al., 2023). Other work has focused on letting models reason
with access to an interpreter such as Program of Thoughts prompting (Chen et al., 2022b),
Program-aided Language Models (Gao et al., 2023), Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), or ReAct
(Yao et al., 2022), while yet others abstracted this scaffolding structure such as Demonstrate-

Search-Predict (DSP) (Khattab et al., 2022), Language Model Cascades (Dohan et al., 2022),
or Cognitive Architectures (Sumers et al., 2023). Each work can be viewed as the result of
researchers asking, “Given an imperfect LM, how can we provide structure to help it solve
problems?” We instead ask if LMs can design that structure and improve it using itself.
Surprisingly, GPT-4 proposes scaffolding techniques introduced after its training cutoff.
Language Models as Prompt Engineers. Work has also explored LMs’ ability to optimize
prompts, such as the Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) (Zhou et al., 2022b) or, recently,
OPRO (Yang et al., 2023) and Promptbreeder (Fernando et al., 2023). Note that, for these, the
goal has consistently been to scaffold the LM to produce a prompt but not to scaffold it to pro-
duce a better scaffolding (beyond prompting-only scaffolds like zero-shot chain-of-thought),
nor to produce a recursively applicable scaffolding. In other words, these works can be
understood as proposing particular scaffolds for prompt engineering but not for scaffold pro-
posal. But, we share the inspiration of LMs improving their reasoning without fine-tuning.
Language Model Self-Improvement. Prior work, such as STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022),
demonstrated that LMs can learn to solve harder problems by learning from their reasoning
chains by filtering based on incorrect answers (as well as Huang et al. 2022, which explored
the specific case where a majority vote is used as the filter and Uesato et al. 2022, which
emphasized the value of checking the accuracy of the reasoning itself). Inspired by self-play
in games, Haluptzok et al. (2023) designed a self-improvement framework for code
generation where an LM generates novel problems for fine-tuning itself. Related work
has explored teaching LMs to debug or optimize code (Chen et al., 2023b; Shypula et al.,
2023). However, our approach is orthogonal to these, as we do not leverage fine-tuning
and instead focus on a model’s ability to improve code that allows it to solve problems.
Other related works are Voyager (Wang et al., 2023), showing that an LM can optimize
the programs available to an embodied agent to improve exploration in the video game
Minecraft , and its contemporaneous work Language Models as Tool Makers (Cai et al., 2023).
Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI). RSI was suggested by Minsky (1966) and Good (1966),
as cited by Yampolskiy (2015). Schmidhuber (2003) first provided a rigorous formalization,
wherein a problem solver would leverage itself to solve iteratively harder problems by
making provable improvements to itself. Some of these principles are also highlighted in
Schmidhuber (1987). Unlike this work, we do not attempt to prove that scaffold improve-
ments made by the model are optimal. As mentioned, RSI code generation differs from
full RSI because only the scaffolding is improved. Additionally, many previous analyses
involved selecting programs at random (i.e., “monkeys at typewriters”) or enumeration
with no dependence on the goal to be improved (Levin, 1973). In contrast, using LMs, we
can describe the underlying goal in a prompt (which itself may be improved). Intuitively,

providing this goal may make program search more effective. Some work has also suggested
constraining types of improvements (Nivel et al., 2013; Steunebrink et al., 2016) to encourage
improvements that mitigate dangerous behavior. Regarding implementations, while efforts
have been made for G ¨odel machines (Hall, 2007; Steunebrink & Schmidhuber, 2012), our
work is first to leverage LMs for recursively self-improving code generation.
3 Problem Statement
In this section, we formulate the goal of selecting an improver via recursively self-improving
code generation. This is viewed as a computationally expensive “pre-optimization” step
with benefits that can be reaped in numerous downstream applications. Precisely, let Σ∗
denote the set of finite text strings, and let L:Σ∗→Σ∗be a randomized black-box LM1
which can be used to generate code, given a query. A utility u= (ufunc,ustr)is a pair where
ufunc :Σ∗→Ris a black-box, possibly randomized function2that assigns bounded real
values to solution strings; and ustr∈Σ∗is a description which may simply be the source
code of the function. With a slight abuse of notation we write u(x)≡ufunc(x)for solution x.
Ataskτ= (u,s)is specified by utility uand a solution s∈Σ∗. In our applications, solutions
are source code, but more generally any utility defined on strings can be used. An improver
Iis a program that improves a task solution using an LM L:
s′=I(u,s,L)ideally with u(s′)≫u(s). (1)
Suppose there is a distribution Dover downstream tasks τ∼ D . Thus, the goal is to find an
improver program Iwith high expected utility when used, ¯u(I)≜E(u,s)∼D
u(I(u,s,L))
.
For training, we assume we are given a collection of ndownstream tasks D∼ Dndrawn
independently from distribution D. We correspondingly define the meta-utility ˆuof an
improver Ias the average utility over downstream training tasks,
ˆu(I)≜1
|D|∑
(u,s)∈Du(I(u,s,L)). (2)
The above equations define ¯ufuncand ˆufunc. For their description string, we use a common
“grey-box” description ¯ustr=ˆustrwhich is a description (e.g., source code) indicating that
the utility is the expectation over a set of downstream tasks, but the individual downstream
tasks themselves are not included in the description. This enables one to optimize over
ˆuas an approximation to the actual objective ¯u. In addition, the theoretical analysis in
Appendix A provides simple conditions under which optimizing ˆualso nearly optimizes
¯u, and formalizes resource bounds on runtime and LMs. Finally, Appendix A also gives an
equivalent formulation of recursively self-improving code generation in terms of recursive
maximization which is more amenable to theoretical analysis and needs no initial solution to
be given. This paper employs the improver formulation because we have found the initial
solution valuable in practice for warm-starting the self-improvement process.

instances after Titerations of self-improvement for the downstream task of learning parity
with noise. Iteration 0 uses the seed improver I0. Given access to a strong LM like GPT-4
(left), STOP consistently improves mean downstream performance. In contrast, with GPT-
3.5 (middle) and Mixtral (right), performance degrades. Details are in Sections 5.1 and 5.3.
4 Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP)
Figure 3 provides a visual schematic of the self-improvement pipeline envisaged in Section 3,
while Algorithm 1 provides Self-Taught Optimizer ( STOP ) pseudocode. The key observa-
tion is that the selection of Iis an optimization problem itself, to which we can recursively
apply improvement. STOP begins with an initial seed improver I0. We define the t-th improver
as the output of tself-improvement rounds with meta-utility ˆu:It≜It−1(ˆu,It−1,L). This is
iterated for a prespecified number of iterations T, per available resources.
Intuition. By using ˆu, STOP selects improver based on a downstream utility improvement .
This approach is motivated by the intuitions that 1) improvers that are good at improving
downstream solutions may be more likely to be good scaffolding programs and thus
to be good at self-improvement, and 2) selecting for single-round improvements may
lead to better multi-round improvements. In practice, we allow the utilities and LM to
impose budget constraints and initial solutions to be generated by humans or a model.
Moreover, the cost is essentially O((budgetu+budgetL)∗budgetˆu), where budget specifies
the number of times an improver can use a function, with these asymptotics defined with
respect to the budget parameters.
Designing the seed improver. Our chosen seed improver (Figure 2) simply prompts the
LM to generate candidate improvements of an initial solution and then returns the best
solution according to the utility function. We chose this simple form to provide nontrivial
improvement for a generic downstream task while 1) encouraging the LM to be as “creative”
as possible, 2) minimizing initial prompt complexity, since self-improvement introduces
additional complexity due to nested references to code strings inside of prompts, and 3)
minimizing the prompt token count and therefore the costs of LM queries. We considered
other seed prompt variants but heuristically found that this version maximized the novelty
of GPT-4-proposed improver improvements.
Describing the utility. To effectively convey the details of the utility function to the LM, we
provide the utility to the improver in two forms, as a callable function and as a utility descrip-
tion string containing the essential elements of the utility source code (see Appendices E
and F for examples). This choice was made for the following reasons. The description allows
us to clearly convey budgetary constraints (e.g., on runtime or function calls) imposed by the
utility to the LM. We first attempted to describe budgetary instructions in the seed improver
prompt, but, as we discuss in Section 6.2, this led to the removal of such instructions and
attempts at reward-hacking in later iterations. The downside of our approach is that it
separates the constraints from the code to be optimized by the LM, which may decrease the
likelihood that it will be used by the LM (Liu et al., 2023b). Finally, we observe empirically
that replacing the source code with a purely English description of the utility leads to a
reduced frequency of non-trivial improvement.
5 Experiments and Results
We explore 1) the benefits of self-improvement over a static seed improver for a fixed target
task, 2) how well an improver trained on one task generalizes to new tasks, and 3) how
5

model size may affect performance. Timestamped versions of the OpenAI models we utilize,
gpt-4-0314 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 , are available within the OpenAI API, to aid with
reproducibility; for Mixtral, we use Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 .
5.1 Self-improvement for a Fixed Downstream Task
We begin by evaluating STOP on a fixed downstream task with GPT-4. We select the task of
learning parity with noise (LPN) (Blum et al., 2000) as a less-well-known, quickly-testable,
and difficult algorithmic task. Note that better-known tasks have solutions more widely
available online. In LPN, bitstrings are labeled with parity computed over an unknown
subset of bits; given a training set of bitstrings with noisy labels, one must predict new
bitstrings’ true labels. Noiseless LPN is easily solved via Gaussian elimination, but noisy
LPN is conjectured to be computationally intractable for large input dimensions (Blum
et al., 2000)–we use a tractable 10-bit input dimension. To define a downstream utility u,
we sample M=20 independent instances of the LPN task with a short timeout and a small
amount of noise and return a solution’s average accuracy on those instances. For the initial
solution s, we use a simple random sampling approach described in Appendix K. Lastly,
as the LM and hence improver are stochastic, we choose Dto be 5 identical copies of (u,s)
in Algorithm 1. To evaluate the generalization of improved improvers to new problem
instances of the same task, we report test meta-utility on an independent set of Mtest=50
LPN instances not seen during improvement.
Figure 4 (left) reports mean test ˆu(±1 standard error) across 5 independent STOP runs,
showing improved downstream performance from 1–3 self-improvement rounds. Note,
however, that, per run, improvement need not be monotonic, as 1) a better improver on
downstream tasks need not be better at optimizing itself and 2) there is inherent stochasticity
in the evaluation from nondeterministic LM calls. But, as the LM does not see the down-
stream task when prompted from the self-improving scaffold—each prompt contains only a
template with placeholders for the task and solution—the LM cannot directly optimize the
improver for the downstream task. We also evaluate two additional baselines for reference:
a chain-of-thought baseline i.e., the seed improver with one attempted improvement and
no utility calls (Wei et al., 2022b) and a greedy iterative improver (i.e., make the maximum
permissible calls, select the best improvement, repeat as the budget allows). Across ten
runs, the chain-of-thought baseline has a meta-utility of 57.7% ±3.0% when it does not error
(49.6% ±3.5% with errors), while the greedy iterative improver scores 64.2% ±0.9%.
5.2 Transferability of Improved Improver
Table 1: Transferability. Evaluating the transfer-
ability of the improver optimized with LPN.

Maxcut 0% 58.7% 74.2%
Parity w/o Noise 50.0% 59.3% 81.7%Our next set of experiments explores
whether an improved improver is
transferable across downstream tasks.
Note that transferability is plausible
as, in the self-improvement phase,
the self-improver is not shown the
downstream utility or downstream
solution, only the meta-utility and its
own improver code. Specifically, we
select a better-performing improver
from Section 5.1 generated by T=4
STOP iterations and evaluate it on five new downstream tasks. Remarkably, we find the
improved improver, detailed in Appendix H, outperforms the seed improver on each new
downstream task without further optimization, as shown in Table 1. As with LPN, we
selected three tasks that are easy to evaluate, not very well known, and still fairly difficult:
String Grid Distance, a string manipulation problem featured in a recent programming
competition ( https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1852/D ); a version of the
quadratic assignment problem where each facility has a preference over each location that
must also be considered when minimizing costs (Koopmans & Beckmann, 1957); and, parity
without noise, as another generalization. We also include two well-known tasks: identifying
solutions to random 3-SAT formulae and solving instances of the maxcut problem, both
with short time constraints. Their utilities and initial solutions are in Appendix G.

maintains a population of top solutions and uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance
exploiting known good solutions and exploring new ones. Exploration corresponds to
higher-temperature sampling, where epsilon is adjusted dynamically based on the rates of
utility improvement from exploration and exploration and temperature gradually decreases.
Lastly, a stopping criterion and reset mechanism are used for efficiency.
5.3 Self-improvement with Smaller Language Models
We next explore the ability of smaller LMs, GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024),
to improve their scaffolding. Following the protocol of Section 5.1 with 25 independent
runs instead of 5, we find that GPT-3.5 is sometimes able to propose and implement better
scaffolds, but only 12% of GPT-3.5 runs yielded at least a 3% improvement. In addition,
GPT-3.5 exhibits a few unique failure cases that we did not observe with GPT-4. First,
we found it was more likely to propose an improvement strategy that did not harm a
downstream task’s initial solution but did harm the improver code (e.g., randomly replacing
strings in lines with some low probability per line, which had less impact on shorter
solutions). Second, if the proposed improvements mostly harmed performance, suboptimal
scaffoldings that unintentionally returned the original solution could be selected, resulting
in no continued improvement as seen in Figure 4. Generally, the proposed “ideas” were
reasonable and creative (e.g., genetic algorithms or local search), but implementations
were overly simplistic or incorrect. Initially, the seed improver with GPT-3.5 has a higher
meta-utility than the one with GPT-4 (65% vs 61%), which we attribute primarily to a higher
prevalence of more complex solutions by GPT-4 that time out, like training a neural network

GPT-3.5 0.12% (0.07-0.21%) 0.17% (0.11-0.27%)
written with numpy for a thousand epochs. Further, the apparent difference in these models’
improvement abilities may be partially explained by work on emergent abilities of LMs (Wei
et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022; Schaeffer et al., 2023). Lastly, we find Mixtral performs
poorly at improving solutions to the downstream task but has a more gradual decrease
in performance relative to GPT-3.5, in part because the improvements are small, mostly
harmless changes, such as revisions to the prompt, improved documentation, and caching.
6 Inspecting STOP-Proposed-and-Implemented Improvements
Next, we qualitatively investigate self-improvement strategies proposed by STOP , high-
lighting encouraging approaches as well as some undesirable patterns. Note that this is a
non-exhaustive, descriptive list. We notably find that a small fraction of generations attempt
reward hacking or sandbox circumvention.
6.1 Proposed Self-Improvement Strategies
We first describe STOP-proposed self-improvement strategies, with examples detailed in
Appendix B and visualized in Figure 1. While each strategy was implemented by STOP , not
all were ultimately selected as improvements, and some used an earlier iteration of the seed
improver than in Figure 2 (see Figure A.19). Nonetheless, a variety of self-improvement
strategies were selected as improved improvers, including the example given in Figure 5.
Beam search. The most common meta-heuristic we observed used by the model was beam
search: the model would keep a list of all of its improvement attempts based on utility and
expand the best kin the list. This has similarities to the Tree-of-Thoughts approach (Yao et al.,
2023) invented years after the training cutoff for the GPT-4 version we used (Sept. 2021).
Genetic and evolutionary algorithms. One common approach proposed was to use a
genetic algorithm. Many of these attempts were infeasible in essential ways; for example,
many would include mutations that perturbed random characters or lines or performed
crossover based on combining strings, all extremely unlikely to work. But some were rea-
sonable, relying on the LM to generate mutations and perform crossover. Although multiple
works have proposed to use genetic or evolutionary algorithms to improve prompts or to
perform neural architecture search (Chen et al., 2023a; Guo et al., 2023), to our knowledge,
all of these were after GPT-4’s training cutoff. We include implementations in Appendix B.
Decomposing and improving parts. A less common but notable approach was where the
LM attempts to improve a solution one function at a time. For example, as in Appendix
Figure A.12, the LM separated the solution into function blocks with regular expressions and
attempted improvements to each block one by one. This can be understood as analogous
to Zelikman et al. (2023): the probability that one of nsolutions solves all of a problem’s in-
dependent, modular parts drops precipitously with the number of parts, but the probability
that an attempt solves a given part does not depend on the number of parts. Therefore, trying
combinations of attempts at parts can substantially increase success. In a related approach,
the model randomized the prompt to optimize varying solution aspects at a time, e.g.,
alternating between searching for better data structures or ways to reduce memory usage.
Simulated annealing. Despite being one of the best-known metaheuristics, to our
knowledge, simulated annealing has not previously been applied as a scaffolding. This
approach seems to draw on an analogy between the concepts of temperature in language
modeling and in simulated annealing, where it gradually decreases and determines whether
to accept a transition from a point to one with worse utility. Notably, it can find global
optima despite many local optima (Goffe et al., 1994; Liu et al., 2020).

Line of seed code (written by us) with sandbox flag

Generated code with modification disabling the sandbox flag
35 score = utility ( solution , use_sandbox = False ) # Use more efficient scoring mechanism
Figure 6: Disabled sandbox. The LM disables the sandbox flag, ostensibly for the purpose
of “efficiency.” A more detailed example is given in Appendix Figure A.34.
Varying temperature to explore. One alternative is to treat temperature as an exploration
parameter: the closer the model is to depleting its budget, the more conservatively it explores.
This bears a resemblance to simulated annealing but optimizes sampling temperature rather
than controlling the acceptance criteria for change in utility of new solutions.
Multi-armed bandit and upper-confidence-bound based search. Another method viewing
the optimization as an exploration task is reframing as a bandit problem: since the utility can
be stochastic, this emphasizes optimally selecting the best of a set of sampled improvements.
6.2 Circumvention Attempts
We also explore whether the LM proposes self-improvement strategies to circumvent the
provided constraints (limiting the number of queries to the downstream utility, the number
of LM calls, and the number of samples per LM call). We observed a few interesting patterns.
First, when not strictly enforcing budget constraints, initially most generated programs
would follow them, but because those that ignored the constraints performed better, these
would be identified by the improver as better. Second, the constraints written in the seed
improver were often omitted when revising the improver, for “simplification.” Finally,
although the LM is passed as an object to the algorithm to enforce the constraints, in at least
one proposed solution the LM attempted to create a new LM object with larger constraints.
To further explore potential risks, we implemented a functionality-limiting “sandbox” as
part of the utility evaluation (see Appendix I), adding a runfunction with a use_sandbox
=True parameter. To test the LM’s frequency of sandbox adherence, we used the LM
to generate 10,000 independent improvements of the seed improver. We then used a
simple syntactic check for apparent “unsandboxed” executions. Specifically, we consider an
improver to be unsandboxed if it contains either string "use_sandbox=False" or"exec(" . For
comparison, we also ran it on the OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo LM. Interestingly, unsandboxing
was more than twice as common for GPT-4 than GPT-3.5-turbo.
We also considered a variant of the seed including a warning, illustrated in Figure 6. Unsand-
boxing occurred at a higher average rate despite the warning, though the difference was not
statistically significant for either model (via a two-proportion z-test with significance level
0.05). Results are reported in Table 2. Upon manual inspection of the model’s plans in gener-
ations, they did not explicitly mention anything “malicious”–all comments discussing sand-
box removal were declared as “for efficiency” or similar, though model “intent” is ill-defined.
6.3 Reward Hacking
We note that the downstream utility function must be defined with care: reward hacking
occurs when an unintended behavior is selected due to a misspecified reward and is a
consequence of exploitable utility functions (see, e.g., Skalse et al., 2022). For example,
for the LPN task, we initially defined the utility with a numpy vector computation: acc
= np.sum(y_hat == y) / n_test . However, we had not considered that the code may
‘improve’ the seed improver to return the predictions in a different “shape,” i.e., an array
with dimensions not as intended. Rather than causing an error, the result was a returned
“accuracy” of over 1000%. It would be valuable to explore the applicability of techniques to
avoid reward hacking (Amodei et al., 2016; Laidlaw et al., 2023) to STOP in future work.
7 Limitations
A fundamental limitation of our approach is that the LM itself is not improved. Furthermore,
our meta-utility measures improver quality only indirectly via improvements in down-
9

--- PAGE 10 ---
Published as a conference paper at COLM 2024
stream task utility. Unlike in some prior work (e.g., Schmidhuber, 2003), any improvement
attempt may result in worse performance, which can lead to further deterioration. Another
limitation is that STOP requires an efficiently-evaluatable (and describable) utility function,
which may not be available for every task. Correspondingly, as STOP’s cost grows
substantially faster than the cost of the optimized improver, it may be expensive to run.
Our improvement framework also maintains a single improver at each step, while some
approaches may benefit from maintaining a population. While this is not a strict limitation
in that an improver could itself sample from a population of implementations, it likely
imposes a bias. Moreover, a deeper analysis of alternative seed improvers and their
tradeoffs would be valuable future work. Lastly, our experiments depend on a closed
large LM that may be deprecated in the future, which harms interpretability and long-term
reproducibility. Based on the GPT-3.5 results, it is unlikely that STOP would consistently
work with any open-source LM at the time of writing (Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al.,
2023). As new models with similar capabilities to GPT-4 emerge, we hope to understand
how and whether STOP generalizes.
Lastly, we note some open challenges. First, although one could potentially apply STOP
to open-domain coding tasks, the meta-utility calculation relies on many calls to the utility –
therefore, expensive utility functions pose additional challenges, and handling such tasks re-
quires further work. We also anticipate that while the optimizer could theoretically optimize
open-ended language inputs, this may make it less likely to act as a good code optimizer.
We also leave this to future work. In addition, it may be possible in principle to overcome
some of the limitations of weaker models with stronger scaffoldings and a larger budget.
8 Conclusions
In this work, we introduced STOP , a framework for recursively optimizing code generation
using LMs as meta-optimizers. We demonstrated that LMs like GPT-4 are capable of im-
proving code that leverages the LM itself. We found that, across a variety of algorithmic
tasks, STOP generates improvers that boost the performance of downstream code. While
the model does not optimize its weights or underlying architecture, this work indicates that
self-optimizing LMs do not require that. However, this is itself a motivation: the capabilities
of future LMs may be misunderstood if strong scaffolding strategies are not tested. Un-
derstanding how LMs can improve their scaffoldings can help researchers understand and
mitigate the potential for misuse of more powerful LMs. Lastly, STOP may allow researchers
to investigate techniques for mitigating undesirable self-improvement strategies.
Ethics Statement: Concerns about Developing STOP
Concerns about the consequences of RSI have been raised since its first mention.
Minsky (1966) wrote, “Once we have devised programs with a genuine capacity for
self-improvement, a rapid evolutionary process will begin... It is hard to say how close
we are to this threshold, but once it is crossed, the world will not be the same.” This is a
particularly contentious topic recently, with intensified concern over negative consequences
(Ambartsoumean & Yampolskiy, 2023; Gabriel & Ghazavi, 2021).
It is thus important to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of studying RSI and specifically
the small advance we introduce. First, STOP does not alter the black-box LM and hence
is not full RSI. Moreover, at this point, we do not believe the scaffolding systems STOP
creates are superior to those hand-engineered by experts. If this is the case, then STOP is not
(currently) enabling additional AI misuse. At the same time, it facilitates the study of aspects
of RSI code generation such as sandbox avoidance and reward hacking. As Christiano (2023)
argues, advances in scaffolding and agent models have the advantage of interpretability
compared to advances in LMs.
However, as techniques for API-based fine-tuning of closed LMs become more available
(OpenAI, 2023a), it would be plausible to incorporate these into the improvement loop.
Therefore, it is difficult to assess the generality of our approach, especially with increasingly
powerful large LMs. However, this is itself a motivation for this work: understanding how
LMs improve their scaffolding in a self-improvement loop can help us understand and

potentially mitigate negative impacts of better models. For instance, the simplistic ways
in which current LMs disable the sandbox are easily detectable. In essence, we would rather
first observe problems with GPT-4 in simplified settings than with more powerful LMs
in real-world use.

A Theoretical Analysis
Here we extend the definitions of Section 3 to account for bounded resources such as runtime
and LM calls, to prove generalization bounds, and to present an equivalent definition in
terms of maximization.
A.1 Bounded resources
We first consider bounded resources. Recall that Σ∗denotes the set of finite strings over an
alphabet (or token set) Σ⊇ {0, 1}. Let|x|denote the length of string x.
Bounded language-models. First, to consider bounded resources, To capture most modern
LMs, we suppose that there are constants c,k∈Nsuch that the LM L:Σc→Σcgenerates
responses of length c, called the context length , to query strings of length c, in time k(shorter
strings are handled by padding). Note that a bounded LM cannot output a program longer
than c, and the same is true for our seed improver I0(u,s,L). Interestingly, however, other
improvers canoutput meaningful programs longer than cby making more than one call to
L.
Bounded-runtime programs. Programs are represented by finite strings ∈Σ∗in a fixed
(Turing-complete) programming language. For simplicity of analysis we assume programs
operate serially in steps. Every string πcan be considered as a program and we write
π(·)∈Σ∗to denote its output (always a string) on one or more inputs. We assume the
inputs can either be strings (which can encode numbers, text, programs, or arbitrary types
of objects) or black-box (possibly randomized) functions. We assume that programs can call
the following special black-box functions:
•A clock function that, in unit time, returns the integer number of steps computed by the
current program thus far and can therefore determine the duration of black-box function
call.
•A random bit function that returns a uniformly random bit in {0, 1}on each invocation,
also running in unit time. We assume a fixed runtime bound brunon all programs being
run to avoid long-running or infinite computations. We assume that there is a special
string⊥ ∈Σ∗where π(x)indicates a program failure, which may be a timeout, or πnot
encoding a valid program (i.e., a syntax error), or a runtime error on its input.
•A sandbox function that runs a given program or black-box function with a parameter
indicating a timeout number of steps.
Bounded utility functions. It will be convenient to bound the range of the utility function.
We assume that the utility function u:Σ∗→[0, 1]is bounded by 1 and that u(⊥) = 0.
To be completely formal, we must explain how to represent utility functions that output
real values. One can do this by adding an additional parameter that indicates the desired
precision, i.e., the number of bits of the output. We omit this from our analysis for simplicity.
Bounded language model calls. The bounds on program runtime indirectly impose a
bound on number of language model calls ≤brun/k. However, we note that in STOP’s
implementation, additional bounds on the number of calls of an LM are explicitly made.
Iterated downstream task improvement. The STOP framework, as in Section 4, considers
only one round of improvement. It would be conceptually straightforward to modify ˆuto
explicitly account for multiple iterations of downstream task improvement. However, note
that an improver can already internally perform multiple iterations of downstream task
improvement.
A.2 Generalization bounds
STOP can be viewed as a “pre-optimization” (like pre-training an LM) to find a good
improver that will be used on a variety of downstream tasks. Generalization bounds
concern the problem of how well will an improver work on future unseen tasks, albeit
from the same distribution as the “training” tasks. In particular, they bound the degree to
which one might be overfitting by using a limited number of training tasks rather than the
17

full distribution. We provide two simple generalization bounds in this section. The first
relates how close ˆuis to expected (one-shot) improvement on new downstream tasks from
the same distribution. The second provides absolute guarantees but for a slightly different
(randomized) meta-utility function.
Thus far we have considered a fixed set of ntasks (u,s)∈D, i.e.,|D|=n, each being
defined by a utility function u= (ufunc,ustr)consisting of a black-box function ufuncand a
string ustr, as well as an initial solution s∈Σ∗. We now consider a distribution Dover tasks
(u,s)∼ D . This is arguably the quantity we ultimately care about, as ¯u(I)determines the
expected performance of a (single iteration) of an improver on a downstream task. If the
tasks D∼ Dnare drawn i.i.d. from D, then one can prove a generalization bound stating
that the average performance of an improver IonDis close to its expected performance on
D:
Lemma 1. Letn≥1,δ∈[0, 1],l≥2,Dbe a multiset of ni.i.d. tasks from D, andΣ≤ldenote the
set of strings I (improver programs) of length |I| ≤l. Then,
Pr
D∼Dnh
For all I ∈Σ≤l:ˆu(I)−¯u(I)<ϵi
≥1−δ,
where ϵ≜r
1
n
lln(|Σ|) +ln1
δ
.
Proof. The standard proof follows from Chernoff bounds and the union bound. Denote the
tasks by τ= (u,s)∼ D . For any fixed improver I, there is a value yτ:=u(I(τ,L))for each
task τ, and ˆu(I) =∑τ∈Dyτ/nis simply the average of ni.i.d. random samples yτ, while
¯u(I) =Eτ∼D[yτ]is the expectation. Thus, by the Chernoff bound, for any ϵ>0 and fixed I,
Pr
D∼Dn[|ˆu(I)−¯u(I)|≥ϵ]≤2 exp −2ϵ2n=2|Σ|2l
δ≤|Σ|l+1
δ,
where in the last step we have used the fact that l,|Σ| ≥ 2. Now there are only |Σ|l+1
possible programs (strings) of length ≤l, and so by the union bound, the probability that
any of them have |ˆu(I)−¯u(I)| ≥ϵis at most δ.
The above lemma means that if selecting the best among any set of improvers according to
ˆuwill yield a value of ¯uthat is within 2 ϵof the best in the set.
Iterated improvement bounds. The above bound is relevant to the case where a final
improver Iis used in a single step of improvement on a downstream tasks, so the ultimate
quantity of interest is ¯u(I). It implies that approximately optimizing ˆu(I)is equivalent
to approximately optimizing ¯u(I). We note that exactly the same bounds would apply to
multiple steps of improvement if one replaced ˆuand ¯uby the corresponding averages of
any given number of rounds of iterated improvement on the new downstream task sampled
fromD.
Stochastic meta-utility. Another simple generalization bound can be given if we consider
the case in which the meta-utility is randomized. In particular, consider ˙u(I)which is
defined to be a randomized function that returns u(I(τ,L))for a random task τ∼ D .
Clearly E[˙u(I)] = ¯u(I), so ˙uis an unbiased estimate of ¯u. Thus it is intuitive that one can
similarly improve using ˙u, albeit with more calls. One advantage of ˙uis the following trivial
observation:
Observation 1. Any algorithm that makes at most ncalls to ˙ucan be perfectly simulated using a a
training set of n =|D|i.i.d. samples D ∼ Dn.
Grey-box utility descriptions. The results in this section lend support to use of grey-box
descriptions of ˆu, which only show its form as an average of utilities, because the grey-box
description is identical, in expectation, to that of ¯u. Put another way, it would be easier to
overfit to the training tasks (up to the worst-case bounds, as shown in this section) if the
tasks are given explicitly to the pre-optimization algorithm, especially in the case where the
program is quite large (as in over-parametrized neural networks that are larger than their
training set size).

A.3 Analysis of equivalent maximization formulation
A second, equivalent formulation is defined in terms of a maximizer program Mwhich, given
an LM and utility, outputs a solution string M(u,L)∈Σ∗. Since we are thinking of a fixed
language model throughout, we omit Land write M(u) =M(u,L)(and I(u,s) =I(u,s,L))
when the language model Lis understood from context. The goal is to achieve high
utility u(M(u)). Unlike an improver, a maximizer Mdoes not require an initial solution.
However, Mcan be still used to produce a higher-quality maximizer by applying Mto an
appropriately defined meta-utility function. To parallel the STOP approach of choosing
Mbased on downstream tasks, one can use a set of downstream task utilities U(no initial
solutions needed) to define the maximizer meta-utility ˜u(M)≜|U|−1∑u∈Uu(M(u))and
consider iterating Mt≜Mt−1(˜u).
To see the equivalence between maximizers and improvers, first note that one can, of
course, convert any maximizer to an improver by ignoring the input solution and taking
I(u,s)≡M(u). For the converse, note that one can utilize improvers as maximizers
by including an initial solution in the utility uand optionally overriding it with a more
recent solution in the comments of M. Specifically, suppose one defines a function e(M,u)
extracting an appropriately encoded prior solution from M, if there is one, and otherwise
the initial solution from u. Then one can convert improvers to maximizers by taking
M(u)≡I(u,e(M,u)). Note that either optimizer can return itself, similar to a “quine.”
STOP uses performance at improving downstream tasks as a heuristic approximation to
selecting good improvers more generally. It is not immediately clear how one would even
give a non-cyclic definition of performance at improving improvers. Now, we illustrate a
way to define recursive maximizer performance in a consistent fashion.
To do so, consider a randomized process in which, in each iteration, a coin is flipped, and
if it is heads, the maximizer is applied to the downstream task; if it is tails, however, it is
applied to the problem of maximizing the maximizer. If the next flip is heads, then the result
is used to maximize the downstream task. Otherwise, it recurs. If the coin has probability
λ∈(0, 1)of being heads, then this process results in an expected number of maximizer
calls, including for maximization and finally for the downstream task, is 1 /λ. Hence, it
is similar to a process where the maximizer is iteratively applied ≈1/λtimes. However,
this randomness enables us to define the objective consistently. In particular, for parameter
λ∈(0, 1), define:
uλ(M)≜˜u(M) with probability λ,
uλ 
M(uλ)
with probability 1 −λ.
While the above definition looks cyclic, it is well-defined, just as a recursive program is
well-defined. One can repeatedly expand the bottom case to get,
uλ(M) =

˜u(M) with probability λ, (maximize downstream performance)
˜u(M(uλ)) with probability λ(1−λ), (maximize downstream maximizer)
˜u 
M(uλ)(uλ)
with probability λ(1−λ)2, (max max that maxes downstream max)
˜u 
M(uλ)(uλ)(uλ)
with probability λ(1−λ)3, (max max ...)
...
Recursively self-improving code generation within the maximization framework may be
achieved by taking a seed program M0(u)similar to our seed improver, which, for example,
queries Lfor a solution maximizing ustrand takes the best according to ufunc. (The number
of queries is taken so as to remain in the runtime budget brun.) Then, one can define
Mt≜Mt−1(uλ)fort=1, 2, . . . , T.
It is tempting to think that a fixed point Mλ∗=Mλ∗(uλ), again a “quine” of sorts, may
be good, but it may equally well be a minimizer as nothing in our framework favors
maximization over minimization except the seed.

There are two main kinds of genetic algorithms that we saw the language model propose:
first, those where fitness is mostly implicit and survival is primarily controlled by the
crossover-based decisions of the language model (i.e., the language model is asked to com-
bine two solutions, theoretically with the ability to disregard one or the other); alternatively,
the utilities could be explicitly considered and used to rank the candidates.

B.9 Improvements across Iterations
Lastly, one may wonder about the changes in the kinds of improvements across iterations.
We note that despite the instructions in the seed prompt to propose non-trivial and novel
improvements, the creativity and scale of improvements appear to decline over iterations.
Later improvements tend to be revisions and optimizations to be base algorithm, keeping its
central idea and extending it (e.g., introducing caching, adding more types of optimizations
to a list of hints, and adding temperature schedules). However, this is not always the case.
For example, consider the improved improver in Figure 5. Its initial improvement was
to dynamically adjust the temperature with the number of calls. Its next improvement
was to implement early stopping based on the number of improvements and to vary the
number of messages used per call. The strategy of randomizing between high-temperature
and low-temperature “explore” vs “exploit” phases was not implemented until the 7th
improvement step, and the choice to use a counter to decide whether exploring or exploiting
was more advantageous occurred in the next step.

I Sandbox Circumvention Details
As discussed in Section 6.2, we slightly modified the seed prompt and meta-utility in a
manner to make it apparent that the code was intended to be run in a sandbox. These
modifications are shown in bold in Figure A.33. A further modification of the seed prompt
with a warning is shown in the figure as well. For this experiment, we did not run any code
but instead performed a simple syntax check for either of the strings "use_sandbox=False"
or"exec(" . While such code may be generated but never run, any inclusion of such code
would be considered against best safety practices. Figure A.34 gives an additional example
of disabling the sandbox flag. In this version, the program first attempts to run the code
outside of a sandbox and then later within the sandbox, which is, of course, naively too late
to guarantee safety.

J Prior Work on Code Generation and Program Synthesis
We note that there is an extensive body of work that has shaped the modern field of code
generation, dating back many decades. However, we emphasize that our primary focus
in this work is on the language model’s ability to improve its own scaffold. Given our
focus, we do not investigate, for example, coding benchmarks that study a model’s ability
to solve real-world software engineering challenges (e.g. SWEBench (Jimenez et al., 2023))
or datasets composed of simple algorithmic problems (e.g. HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021;
Xu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023a)). Moreover, because individual problems in these datasets
have simple correct or incorrect solutions, the individual problems in these datasets would
represent high-variance tasks, while evaluating proposed improvers on the entire dataset
(or representative subsets of the dataset) would be especially computationally expensive.
However, as smaller LMs improve and computation continues to decline in price, we
anticipate that this practical evaluation may become feasible.
In the interest of comprehensiveness, we highlight some of them here. For example, some
work has attempted program synthesis from input-output examples (Bauer, 1979; Gulwani,
2016; Ellis et al., 2021; Bowers et al., 2023; Jain et al., 2021), while others have approached
it using natural language descriptions (Raza et al., 2015; Yin & Neubig, 2017; Desai et al.,
2016). Some have emphasized library learning, building up increasingly complex functions
automatically (Bowers et al., 2023), while others emphasize a revision-based approach.
Some works have augmented LMs with learned verifiers or value functions to help guide
code generation or problem-solving (Polu & Sutskever, 2020; Cobbe et al., 2021; Ni et al.,
2023; Zhang et al., 2023). One may imagine using one of these learned value functions as an
approximation of the utility function in STOP if computing the actual utility is prohibitively
computationally expensive. Some works have explored generating tests for code with
language models as well (Chen et al., 2022a). This raises the question of what it would mean
for a language model to propose a utility function. Moreover, while numerous LMs have
been implemented with a primary focus on code generation, most tend to underperform
the best generalist LMs (Li et al., 2022; Le et al., 2022; Roziere et al., 2023; Austin et al., 2021;
Xu et al., 2022).
K Supplementary Experiment Details
The string representation of the utility function need not match the true code exactly. For
example, we typically obfuscate irrelevant logging code and any random seed values. We
use multithreading libraries for implementing timeouts, but we remove these for simplicity
and instead only present simpler timeout mechanisms to the model, like returning a zero
score if an evaluation takes too long. Outside of the sandbox experiments, we include an
exec command in the utility description but have a minimal function to evaluate the code
to help debug and prevent the use of some undesirable libraries like multiprocessing. We
also omit details that assign necessary properties to utility function like the budget or this
currently-discussed string representation.

--- PAGE 45 ---
Published as a conference paper at COLM 2024
For learning parity with noise, we use a timeout of 2 seconds, a fixed bitlength (10 bits), a
p=30% chance that a bit will be included in the parity subset for a task, 100 train samples
for a given instance, and 20 test samples. In practice, about 3 thousand GPT4 calls were
used per iteration per run.
All Wilson (1927) confidence intervals for binomial proportions were computed using the
Python function statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportion_confint .
For all tasks, we selected parameters such that the problem was approachable (i.e., the base
improver could at least sometimes improve performance over the base performance) but
non-trivial (the model should not immediately get perfect performance).
L On the Novelty of Improvements
One crucial abstract question that this work must contend with is how one should evaluate
the novelty or creativity of the model’s proposed improvement strategies. For example,
the underlying meta-optimization strategies of genetic algorithms or simulated annealing
are certainly not ones that GPT-4 proposed from scratch. We preface this discussion with
a caveat: whether a proposed idea is creative or novel is ultimately always going to be
a subjective judgment and is, to some extent, tied to the training data of the model – this
is further complicated by the fact that, for the models we used, we do not have access to
the details of their training data. With that being said, we would suggest that some of
the strategies proposed by the model indeed appeared substantially different from the
techniques that we had observed. For example, the simulated annealing approach seemed
like a clever technique by implicitly recognizing that the underlying global optimization
task may require non-monotonic improvement. Yet, it is not the first time that simulated
annealing has been used to optimize a difficult NLP task (e.g., Liu et al. (2020)). Similarly,
the choice to attempt to improve code by attempting to improve one function at a time
instead of revising also seemed creative, but the idea of decomposing a problem into parts
and attempting to solve them individually is certainly not new in this space.
Whether the fundamental optimization techniques are or are not novel, we would suggest
that the automatic search and application of the existing optimization ideas to language
model optimization and recursive self-improvement is novel. Many existing scaffolding
innovations are also existing optimization techniques applied to LM-based optimization,
such as Tree of Thoughts and Parsel. Part of the challenge comes from understanding
which aspects of the optimization algorithm map onto which elements of the problem. For
example, we found that STOP generated many genetic algorithms; however, only in a small
subset of these generated genetic algorithms did it use the language model to perform the
crossover and mutation. In many others, it performed mutations by randomly changing
characters and crossover by randomly concatenating two randomly-truncated solution
strings. Moreover, almost any new optimization algorithm can be described with reference
to existing optimization algorithms, so it is ambiguous when an optimization algorithm
is “different enough” to be considered new as opposed to simply a variant of an existing
approach.
M Reproducibility
We include implementation details, prompts, and relevant code examples throughout the
paper and appendix. For reproducibility, we also include sandbox experiment details in
Appendix I, additional experimental details around the utility description construction and
the downstream tasks in Appendix K, the various utility descriptions and seed algorithms
in Appendix F and Appendix G, and code examples of all discussed improvement attempts
in Appendix H. We use models that are publicly available (primarily gpt-4-0314 ) and have
open-sourced our code at https://github.com/microsoft/stop .
N Impact Statement
There are several potential benefits of AI systems related to education, health, and many
important aspects of quality of life. However, we recognize and take seriously the potential

negative consequences of AI systems as well. Of particular interest is the concern, discussed
by many authors, that recursively self-improving systems may have unintended negative
consequences. Section 8 discusses the reasons we feel this research, in balance, contributes
to the study of a problem that is net beneficial. Specifically, the study of recursively self-
improving code generation produces interpretable code, which makes it easier to detect and
understand unintended behaviors of such systems. Our experiments in Section 6.2 show
how this line of work enables the quantitative study of such behaviors.
