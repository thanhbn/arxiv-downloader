Abstract
As large language models (LLMs) have
become the norm in NLP, demonstrating good
performance in generation and reasoning
tasks, one of its most fatal disadvantages
is the lack of factual correctness. Generat-
ing unfactual texts not only leads to lower
performances but also degrades the trust
and validity of their applications. Chain-
of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves
trust and model performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating interpretable
reasoning chains, but still suffers from
factuality concerns in knowledge-intensive
tasks. In this paper, we propose the Verify-
and-Edit framework for CoT prompting,
which seeks to increase prediction factuality
by post-editing reasoning chains according
to external knowledge. Building on top
of GPT-3, our framework lead to accuracy
improvements in multiple open-domain
question-answering tasks. For reproducing
our results and extending the framework
further, we make our codebase available at

1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the
new norm in many downstream NLP tasks. In
utilizing these LLMs, Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting (Wei et al., 2022) is found to improve
performances for tasks that require complex reason-
ing, such as math word problems, commonsense
reasoning, and symbolic manipulation. At the same
time, it is able to generate interpretable reasoning
chains. Recent work further explored how to use
these reasoning chains to select better predictions.
However, the primary focus of these methods has

been to improve end-task performance by utiliz-
ing generated CoTs as-is. For example, Ye and
Durrett (2022) train a calibrator that tunes predic-
tion probabilities based on rationale scores; Wang
et al. (2022) sample multiple reasoning paths to ﬁnd
the most common (consistent) prediction. Only a
few, such as Creswell et al. (2022) and Zhou et al.
(2022), have explored ways to improve the quality
of CoTs themselves.
In fact, improving the CoT quality could be ben-
eﬁcial in enhancing both interpretability and end-
task performance. Ye and Durrett (2022) point out
that explanations judged as good by humans of-
ten indicate more accurate predictions. Intuitively,
a better set of CoT prompts could provide better
grounding and logically consistent thought pro-arXiv:2305.03268v1  [cs.CL]  5 May 2023

cesses, thus leading to more accurate predictions.
To improve generation quality, one important
aspect is factual correctness , which is currently
one of the most fatal drawbacks of LLMs (OpenAI-
Blog, 2022; Zhao et al., 2023). In answering user
queries, LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)
tend to make up facts and details, which is now
ﬂagged as a primary warning in their API usage.
As a major use case of LLMs is the prospect of
replacing traditional search engines and usage for
more direct information access through question-
answering, factuality concerns could largely un-
dermine their validity and degrade users’ level of
trust (Marcus, 2022). Fixing this issue is challeng-
ing and the concerns still persist even after the
models are instruction-tuned with human feedback
(Ouyang et al., 2022). This is because the source
of truth can be unavailable during the ﬁnetuning
process (OpenAI-Blog, 2022).
Thus, it is of urgent concern to better control the
generation and increase the factual correctness of
predictions. As LLMs could fail to recall accurate
details when functioning as a knowledge base (Ye
and Durrett, 2022; Creswell et al., 2022), if pos-
sible, knowledge from external sources could be
introduced as assistance. Assisted thought process
is also common in human reasoning: when humans
answer questions, they often search (or revisit) ex-
ternal knowledge sources for supporting facts in
order to refresh their (internal) memory.
Inspired by this, in this work we propose a
Verify-and-Edit (VE) framework to post-edit the
reasoning chains for more factually aligned predic-
tions. As shown in Fig. 1, we ﬁrst select uncertain
instances to edit, which have a less-than-majority-
agree consistency. These instances, as implied
by Wang et al. (2022), often consist of plausible-
sounding statements, such as the sentence “John
Nyskohus played for the Norweigian football team
Odd Greenland" in Fig. 1. When editing, we ﬁrst
generate a question to verify this detail, such as
“What team did John Nyskohus play for?” Then,
to answer this query, we introduce external knowl-
edge through open-domain retrieval systems. For
example, the fact “John Nyskohus ... played for
Adelaide City..” is retrieved in this instance. Then,
the rationales are edited by providing the retrieved
facts in the prompts as memory refreshments. Thus,
the edited rationales could be updated correspond-
ing to the retrieved facts (Fig. 1). Given the edited
rationales, the new prediction is generated, whichconsiders more factually aligned reasoning traces.
To our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst to post-
edit CoT-style reasoning chains to enhance predic-
tion performance. We perform experiments on two
open-domain Question Answering (QA) tasks that
require reasoning: Adversarial HotpotQA (Yang
et al., 2018) and 2WikiMultihop (Ho et al., 2020).
We also test its performance on the Fact Veriﬁcation
task using Fever (Thorne et al., 2018). We ﬁnd that
the model is able to beneﬁt from more factual rea-
soning chains, thus generating more accurate pre-
dictions. For example, for open-domain QA, our
model demonstrates 3.8x accuracy improvement
compared to similar retrieval-augmented models on
AdvHotpot. On 2WikiMultihop, Verify-and-Edit
reaches 33.6% accuracy with open-domain search,
while CoT Self-Consistency stands at 27.7%.
2 Related Work
Chain-of-Thought or CoT (Wei et al., 2022) is a
prompting method for improving the reasoning
abilities of LLMs, which enables LLMs to decom-
pose complex problems into multiple intermediate
steps. CoT provides interpretability and has been
proven to be more capable of solving complex prob-
lems than standard prompting methods.
However, hallucination is a long-standing prob-
lem in NLP, especially for LLMs, which has drawn
signiﬁcant attention from the research communities.
The decoding process of LLMs is auto-regressive,
which unavoidably makes it output nonfactual con-
tent without controlled generation (Ye and Durrett,
2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022). As such, the lack
of supporting facts during the generation process
of CoT could largely undermine the validity of the
ﬁnal answer (Golovneva et al., 2022). Ye and Dur-
rett (2022) demonstrate that the accuracy of the
ﬁnal answers largely correlates with the factuality
and consistency of the reasoning explanations. The
commonly proposed methods to improve the fac-
tuality of CoT reasoning process can be grouped
into two categories: prompt engineering and result
calibration.
Prompt engineering methods are usually applied
to guide LLMs to generate better intermediate rea-
soning explanations. ReAct (Yao et al., 2022),
which is the most comparable to our work, syn-
ergizes reasoning and acting in LLMs, where rea-
soning steps help the model induce and update
actions, while action steps allow the model to con-
sult additional information from Wikipedia for a

--- PAGE 3 ---
factuality check. Compared to ReAct , we generate
more natural and conversational CoTs for better
interpretability and easier learning. As such, our
framework requires a much shorter prompt to learn.
Press et al. (2022) propose self-ask by instructing
the LLM to explicitly ask itself (and then answer)
follow-up questions before answering the initial
question. One natural way of solving a complex
problem is to decompose the problem into sub-
problems and solve them sequentially. Zhou et al.
(2022) adopt the idea and propose least-to-most
prompting. However, both self-ask andleast-to-
most prompting still rely on repetitively retrieving
internal knowledge learned by the LLM instead
of connecting to external knowledge. Thus, their
ability to improve factuality is limited.
Result calibration functions on the output of the
LLMs. Ye and Durrett (2022) train a calibrator
to calibrate the weights of the ﬁnal answers based
on the factuality and consistency of the generated
explanations, which efﬁciently improves the re-
sults. The decoding method in CoT is naive greedy,
which simply outputs the next token with the high-
est probability. Wang et al. (2022) propose a self-
consistency decoding method, which samples a
diverse set of reasoning paths and then selects the
most consistent answer by marginalizing out the
sampled reasoning paths. Selection-Inference (SI)
(Creswell et al., 2022) framework is another state-
of-the-art method that exploits LLMs as general
processing modules. Out of all the methods, it
is also the ﬁrst to systematically improve the fac-
tual correctness of CoTs in order to predict more
accurately. It alternates between selection and in-
ference to generate a series of interpretable, causal
reasoning steps leading to the ﬁnal answer, which
is proven to be efﬁcient. However, it is not de-
signed for open-domain or commonsense question
answering.
Moreover, another comparable line of work
has been exploring retrieval-augmented language
model pretraining (REALM) (Guu et al., 2020),
which ﬁrst retrieves documents from an external
knowledge source and then utilizes retrieved docu-
ments to process question-answering tasks. Lazari-
dou et al. (2022) propose to include Google search
results of the question in the prompt to improve the
factuality of the generated answer. However, such
methods may fail in complex questions as it does
not utilize the reasoning capability of LLMs. Thus,
we consider retrieval-augmented reasoning pathsas a natural way to increase factual alignment.
3 Verify-and-Edit Framework
Our goal is to make LLMs generate more factual
reasoning chains with CoT prompting assisted with
external knowledge, thereby also improving predic-
tion accuracy of the ﬁnal answer. We hypothesize
that this can enhance LLMs’ capability to solve
complex knowledge-intensive tasks that require
multiple reasoning steps to arrive at an answer.
Generally, we hope to follow the human reason-
ing process: when a person answers a question, if
he/she is unsure, he/she would search for a sup-
porting fact and consider it before giving the ﬁnal
answer. Thus, we could separate the Verify-and-
Edit (VE) framework into 3 different stages: ﬁnd-
ing uncertain predictions, editing their rationales
by searching for supporting facts, and using the
edited rationales to generate ﬁnal answers (Fig. 1).
In designing the stages, we hope to maximally pre-
serve the LLMs’ biggest advantage: their open-
generation and reasoning ability. And we aim to
design tasks and setups as natural and conversa-
tional as possible, thus making it easy to under-
stand for humans and LLMs which are trained with
natural texts.
3.1 Deciding when to edit
How can we identify when a model is unsure of
its prediction? The self-consistency method (Wang
et al., 2022) provides a solution. In sampling di-
verse reasoning paths and answers, self-consistency
is found to be highly correlated with accuracy, sug-
gesting that it could provide an uncertainty estimate
and confer abilities for the model to “know when
it doesn’t know". Thus, we begin the VE frame-
work by using the consistency method to sample n
diverse reasoning paths for a prediction task. The
highly consistent predictions are left as-is. When
consistency is lower than dn=2e,i.e. the majority
cannot agree on the same answer, we label it as
“uncertain".
3.2 How to edit a speciﬁc rationale
The rationale, i.e. the thought process (CoT), could
be viewed in two parts: facts and reasoning which
combines facts to derive a new claim. Thus, we
consider improving the CoT from both aspects.
Facts To make the thought process more factu-
ally correct, we search for supporting facts in exter-
nal knowledge sources ( e.g. Wikipedia, Google).

First, to mimic a human’s query when searching
for validating facts, a natural question is gener-
ated to verify the rationale. For this, we use the
in-context learning capability of the same LLM.
The original question and the rationale are both
provided in the prompt for verifying question gen-
eration to ensure that it asks for the most relevant
information required to answer the original ques-
tion, instead of other entities in the rationale. For
example, if the rationale (wrong) is “the US pres-
ident born on 4 August 1961 is John Kennedy.”
and the original question is "who is the spouse of
the US president born on 4 August 1961”, we ex-
pect the generated verifying question to be: “Who
is the US president born on 4 August 1961?” in-
stead of “When is John Kennedy’s birthday?” By
generating a relevant question instead of directly
querying with the generated rationale, we eliminate
potential noise brought by incorrect fact generation.
In the example above, if one retrieves using the
wrong claim “the US president born on 4 August
1961 is John Kennedy”, the incorrect entity “John
Kennedy” may obfusticate the search process.
In this paper, we use relevant contexts re-
trieved from 3 systems: ( i) DrQA (Chen et al.,
2017), an open-domain question-answering sys-
tem; ( ii) Wikipedia search of relevant pages; and
(iii) Google search, which demonstrates possibili-
ties of combining LLMs and search engines.
As the retrieved contexts from a retrieval systemcould be longer than desired, we use a pre-trained
LM to rank and select the top- ksentences most
similar to the verifying question query.
Reasoning While methods such as Selection-
Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) directly use re-
trieved facts as rationales, they are usually too ver-
bose, longer than desired, or contain irrelevant de-
tails. Ye and Durrett (2022) have made similar
observations: directly using supporting sentences
is usually too verbose and not sufﬁcient.
To obtain more relevant and logical rationales,
we again utilize a natural and generative approach,
as reasoning abilities are believed to be already
built into LLMs (Wei et al., 2022). In particular, by
feeding in prompts in the format of “question, ratio-
nale, answer”, the LLM learns to reason for a few
steps before answer generation. Upon investigating
the original rationales, we observe that, even when
they contain incorrect facts, the logical reasoning
component seems to be generally intact. Thus, we
use the verifying questions (as logic) and retrieved
facts (as information) to generate informed answers.
The informed answers are then composed into a
new rationale, providing potentially a more factual
CoT.
3.3 Answering again
Finally, with the post-edited CoT, new answers are
generated by prompting the LLM. A pseudocode

--- PAGE 5 ---
of the overall procedure is given in Alg. 1, and il-
lustrated with an example in Fig. 1 . We can see
that, by allowing the LLM to incorporate exter-
nal knowledge, our method could result in more
factually-grounded rationales. When prompted into
the LLM as a CoT, it could bring in the informa-
tion necessary to make a new prediction, which was
originally not remembered correctly by the model.
Compared to speciﬁcally designed prompts such
as ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), the Verify-and-Edit
framework is simple and arguably more natural. Its
conversational nature could allow humans to better
understand the model’s thought processes and have
the potential for users to naturally interfere and
revise at any stage of inference. In the experiments
presented next, we also observe that such a setup
is effective in mitigating factuality concerns and
boosting end-task performances.
4 Experiment Setup
4.1 Reasoning tasks
As the Verify-and-Edit framework offers more
knowledge-grounded reasoning steps, it should
beneﬁt tasks that fulﬁll the following two prop-
erties: ( i) reliant on multi-hop reasoning to arrive
at a later prediction, thus depending on rationale
generation, and ( ii) open-domain, thus needing to
interact with an external knowledge source.
Therefore, we validate the approach on three
datasets: ( i)Adversarial HotpotQA (Yang et al.,
2018), a multi-hop question answering dataset. We
use the challenging subset proposed by Ye and
Durrett (2022), where the correct and incorrect pre-
dictions are balanced using their model. ( ii)2Wiki-
Multihop (Ho et al., 2020) a multi-hop question-
answering dataset exploiting the structured format
in Wikidata and use logical rules.1(iii)Fever
(Thorne et al., 2018), a fact veriﬁcation dataset
that labels claims as “SUPPORTS”, “REFUTES”,
or “NOT ENOUGH INFO” based on evidence para-
graphs from Wikipedia. Similar to the HotpotQA
setup, we sample a challenging set by balancing
the samples where GPT3 CoT makes correct and
incorrect predictions. Details on the processing and
use of the datasets can be found in Appendix A.
4.2 Compared methods
To provide the most state-of-art performance esti-
mates, we utilize the GPT-3 instruct series API
1We randomly sample 1,000 samples out of 12,576 dev
samples for cost considerations.text-davinci-003 (Ouyang et al., 2022), the
strongest and most up-to-date model at the time
of experiments, as a backbone. The cost of experi-
ments is stated in Appendix B.
Adversarial HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihop ex-
periments used 6-shot and Fever used 3-shot in-
context learning, as Fever questions are shorter
and easier to learn. We use the manual annota-
tions provided for HotpotQA by Ye and Durrett
(2022) and manually annotate few-shot examples
for 2WikiMultihop and Fever in a similar format.
Full prompts for baseline and our methods are pro-
vided in Appendix C.
Baselines To provide a more comprehensive
overview of where our framework stands, we use
the following baselines:
1.Standard Prediction (Standard): Directly pre-
dicting the label based on input, given the same
number of in-context learning examples.
2.Original CoT (Wei et al., 2022): Predicting the
label after generating the explanation.
3.CoT with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC) (Wang
et al., 2022): Sampling 5 CoT trajectories with
a decoding temperature of 0.7, which is recom-
mended by the paper.
4.Calibrator (Calib.) (Ye and Durrett, 2022): A
calibrator that tunes the probabilities of a pre-
diction based on the score of its prediction.
5.ReAct (Yao et al., 2022): A reason-and-act
framework that utilizes an external Wikipedia
API. For this baseline, we use the reported re-
sults in the original paper, which uses the PaLM
model (Chowdhery et al., 2022), whose perfor-
mance is similar to GPT-3.2To add a more
justiﬁed perspective, we report its performance
improvement gained on top of the CoT-SC base-
line.3
Verify-and-Edit (VE) In implementing the VE
framework, the same consistency baseline is em-
ployed to estimate when the model is uncertain.
As stated in §3.1, we edit all instances with a
self-consistency score below dn=2e, wherenis
the number of sampled paths. Then, the verify-
ing questions are produced using a 2-shot4setup
2We could not use PaLM as it is not open-sourced.
3it is worth noting that ReAct conducted experiments on
the entire dataset, where we used a sampled version (see §4.1).
4As we observe that question generation quality does not
vary too much as in-context examples increase, we select the
shortest prompt that is able to generate reasonable questions
to reduce cost.

--- PAGE 6 ---
with in-context learning. The verifying answers are
produced using the same number of examples in
original answer generation and greedy decoding.
To study the effect of knowledge retrieval sys-
tems on the results, we use four systems:
1.Wikipedia-API (wiki): Searching for the query
entities and selecting top sentences from their
Wikipedia pages.
2.DrQA (Chen et al., 2017): A pre-trained open-
domain QA model that combines bigram hash-
ing, TF-IDF matching, and a multi-layer recur-
rent neural network model. We only utilize the
contexts retrieved from it.5
3.Google : Using top-ksearch results produced by
Google as assistive contexts. This result is in-
teresting in providing possibilities in combining
search engines and LLMs.
4.Dataset : Selecting from the set of paragraphs
provided in Adversarial HotpotQA and 2Wiki-
MultihopQA, which includes ground-truth sup-
porting contexts and distractor paragraphs. This
is similar to an oracle setup, which provides an
upper bound of the performance boost, assum-
ing we have a good retrieval system.
For 1, 2, and 4, after retrieving, we select the top
3 sentences most similar to the query ranked by the
pre-trained Sentence BERT model (Reimers and
Gurevych, 2019) as context.
5 Results and Analysis
5.1 Using Self-Consistency: know when it
doesn’t know
For the ﬁrst step in the Verify-and-Edit framework,
consistency is used to measure the model’s conﬁ-
dence in a prediction. Aligned with the ﬁndings
from Wang et al. (2022), we hypothesize that when
the consistency is low, the model is more uncertain
and thus more likely to generate inaccurate predic-
tions. To test whether this hypothesis holds, we plot
the kernal density estimation plots for consistency
distribution on the Adversarial HotpotQA dataset.
As shown in Fig. 2, the incorrect samples show a
left-skewed consistency distribution, where most
incorrect predictions have low consistencies. On
the other hand, the distribution of correct predic-
tions shows a right-skewed tendency, where there
5We selected DrQA by ﬁrst conducting small-scale ex-
periments with different open-domain QA models, including
DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020). DrQA is found to yield better
performance. Thus, we consistently use it.

tency on the Adversarial HotpotQA dataset. With ker-
nal estimation, the curve extends its true distribution’s
range, which is from 0 to 5 (as we sampled 5 paths).

tencies. This effectively validates our hypothesis.
In the main experiments, we use dn=2eas a ma-
jority threshold and edit all samples below it, which
is at3. To show the effects of different thresholds
on the framework’s performance, we also provide
an ablation study later.
5.2 Results on HotpotQA
Reported in Table 1, we observe that CoT improves
on top of the Standard few-shot setting. CoT-SC,
on the other hand, does not demonstrate a good
improvement on the baseline. Using the calibra-
tor from Ye and Durrett (2022), AUC is improved
as it learns to calibrate the answer weights based
on ground-truth contexts provided in the dataset.

represents the improvement on Exact Match from the

Thus, it should be compared with the last setup
of VE, where we use dataset knowledge. In com-
parison, the calibrator results in a lower AUC and
cannot improve the accuracy as it does not generate
alternative answers in open-domain settings.
Using the Verify-and-Edit framework, the re-
trieval systems Wikipedia and DrQA could gener-
ate an improvement of 4.5% and 4.8% respectively
on top of the baseline, which is 2x the highest EM
improvement for ReAct (1.7%). When we com-
bine the search engine results from Google into the
framework, the EM is increased by 6.5%, which
is 3.8x the ReAct result. This shows a promising
method for combining search engines and LLMs,
which is a popular direction now. Search engines re-
turn factual results, but are less powerful in queries
that require reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs
are powerful in reasoning and abstraction but tend
to generate plausible-sounding but incorrect state-
ments (OpenAI-Blog, 2022; Zhao et al., 2023). To
combine the best of both worlds, we could utilize
the long memory of LLMs, as many users have
reported that GPT is able to remember inputs men-
tioned earlier in the dialogue. By providing factual
results from the search engines as a memory re-
freshment, GPT is able to generate better and more
factual predictions.
Then, when we use the adversarially augmented
paragraphs provided in the dataset, the model is
able to demonstrate very high EM (56.8%) and
AUC (60.94) at the same time. This setup shows

5.3 Results on 2WikiMultiHop
As shown in Table 2, our method demonstrates even
stronger performances on 2WikiMultiHop com-
pared to HotpotQA. The Verify-and-Edit frame-
work with open-domain retrieval is able to generate
a high accuracy improvement, ranging from 3.4%
to 5.9%. Selecting from paragraphs provided in
the dataset, which includes supporting evidences
and irrelevant paragraphs, the accuracy improve-
ment is further increased to 9.5%. The calibrator,
on the other hand, uses the dataset provided para-
graphs but still lags behind all variations of our
Verify-and-Edit framework.
5.4 Results on fact veriﬁcation
Results on the Fever dataset are shown in Table 3.
As the reasoning required by the Fever dataset is
less multi-hop compared to HotpotQA and 2Wiki-
MultiHop, we anticipate that it should demonstrate
lower improvements compared to the other two.
In the Fever dataset, the calibrator method com-
pletely fails, decreasing to 33.7%: it calibrates
the prediction scores based on factuality estimates,
which is produced by examining the overlap be-
tween the reasoning path and the provided context.
However, in such Fact Veriﬁcation datasets, there is
no provided contexts. Thus, we calibrate using the
original claim, which results in bad performances.
It shows here that one limitation of the calibrator
method is that it only applies to cases with provided
relevant contexts.
Even though this task does not require much
reasoning, employing the Verify-and-Edit frame-
work, we are able to observe consistent improve-
ments over the baseline method. Similar to before,
the Wikipedia retrieval is able to result in a larger
improvement over DrQA, and Google search im-
proves further at 1.9%.

HotpotQA dataset. “Ours” refers to the Verify-and-Edit
model with Google retrieval.
Compared to our method, ReAct is able to
demonstrate a larger improvement on Fever. First
of all, it has been mentioned before that Fever is
less suited for the Verify-and-Edit framework as it
requires less reasoning to solve the task. Secondly,
ReAct prompts are much longer than our prompts,
requiring more computational costs.
5.5 Cost considerations
As cost reduction is a main concern when inter-
acting with LLMs, our method takes it into con-
sideration and attempts to reduce computational
costs from two aspects: Firstly, Verify-and-Edit
only makes edits for selected instances, whereas
others edit every time. Speciﬁcally, we only revise
when the model is uncertain (judged by consis-
tency), which occurs 40% of the time. As a com-
parison, other methods, such as ReAct, retrieve
relevant information and edit for every single in-
stance, resulting in higher costs. Secondly, Verify-
and-Edit designs tasks that are natural and conver-
sational, requiring only a few demonstrations and
short prompts to learn. For example, other methods
usually learn non-natural calls, such as [thought]
and [action] tags in ReAct and API calls in Tool-
former (Schick et al., 2023). Therefore, the LLM
requires longer prompts, more demonstrations, or
even ﬁne-tuning to learn the format. On the other
hand, we design Verify-and-Edit tasks to be as nat-
ural as possible, requiring minimal effort to learn.
Our tasks only consist of asking and answering
questions, with no synthetic tags or tasks to be
learned. As a comparison, with the GPT-3 API, for
editing one Fever instance, Verify-and-Edit costs
$0.014, whereas ReAct costs $0.017.
5.6 Evaluating the reasoning chains with
human study
To closely examine the faithfulness of the gener-
ated reasoning chains, we also conduct a small-
scale human study experiment. During the exper-
iment, two human volunteers are shown 50 ran-
domly selected questions with generated reasoning
chains from CoT-SC and Verify-and-Edit on the
HotpotQA dataset. They are then asked to select
Figure 3: Ablation study on the effect of various consis-
tency thresholds on task performances on Adversarial
HotpotQA
the more factually consistent one. V olunteers are
encouraged to use search engines as assistance. A
detailed description on the setup is described in
Appendix D.
Shown in Table 4, humans select the reasoning
chains produced by Verify-and-Edit as more factu-
ally consistent 53% of the time, compared to 17%
for the CoT-SC baseline. The Cohen is at 0.25,
showing fair agreement between the two annota-
tors (McHugh, 2012). The annotators used Google
search as an assistive tool 100% of the time, which
shows the necessity of introducing external knowl-
edge.
Moreover, human annotations in this case re-
quire a lot of efforts. Annotators report 1.5 minutes
on average to validate one data point. Thus, au-
tomating the Verify-and-Edit process is of beneﬁts
as an assistive tool to reduce human labor.
To observe the qualitative effects of the Verify-
and-Edit framework in detail, we also include sev-
eral interesting examples in Appendix E, which
show the effectiveness of our framework in correct-
ing the original claims.
5.7 Ablation study: editing at different
consistency thresholds
In the Verify-and-Edit framework, the only hyper-
parameter to select is the consistency threshold.
Similar thresholds also exists in ReAct (Yao et al.,
2022), where the CoT !ReAct method is to em-
ploy ReAct-style prompting when “the majority
answer among n CoT-SC samples occurs less than
n/2 times". Using majority counts, however, is less
ﬁne-grained compared to using the original con-
sistency formulated with log probablities. Thus,
we employ the original score proposed by Wang
et al. (2022), which is the unnormalized answer
probabilities marginalized over the rationales’ log

--- PAGE 9 ---
probabilities. To mimic a majority-vote threshold,
we selectdn=2e, wherenis the number of sampled
paths.
To study the effect of adjusting the consistency
threshold on our framework, we show the ablation
results of Adversarial HotpotQA in Fig. 3. As
the threshold increases, accuracy ﬁrst increases,
reaching a peak close to dn=2e, which is 3, before
decreasing. The AUC scores demonstrate a similar
trend.
As shown in Fig. 2, when consistency is larger
than majority (dn=2e), there are usually more cor-
rect predictions rather than incorrect predictions,
and vice versa. Thus, as we increase the consis-
tency threshold from 0 to dn=2e, more uncertain
and possibly incorrect samples are getting edited by
introducing external knowledge. As we go beyond
the ideal thresholddn=2e, we are mostly re-editing
correct samples, and the introduced noise may dis-
rupt the original reasoning chains.
Thus, we recommend a consistency threshold at
dn=2eas an ideal level.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we introduce a Verify-and-Edit frame-
work for open-domain question-answering. It is
a ﬁrst attempt to post-edit CoT-style reasoning
chains for better end-task performance. By combin-
ing knowledge retrieval with reasoning, the frame-
work edits CoTs in a natural and conversational
way, which enhances prediction factuality. Com-
bined with Google search, the framework also
shows a promising direction that combines the
open-generation ability of state-of-art LLMs with
the updated facts provided by search engines.
Limitations
There are a few limitations to the current frame-
work. Firstly, Verify-and-Edit works the best for
open-domain question-answering tasks that require
complex reasoning. Less complex datasets or com-
monsense datasets that do not require knowledge
retrieval may not result in high improvements. Sec-
ondly, it is most ideal to edit a group of mostly
incorrect samples, which we try to select by using
consistency. Thus, our method is reliant on the con-
sistency method’s performance and its abilities to
separate correct and incorrect predictions. Most of-
ten, it can demonstrate a larger improvement with
a more challenging set of examples.
To address these limitations, we plan to work onreducing the noise brought in the rationale-editing
stage and utilize more knowledge resources, such
as knowledge bases, as a follow-up.
Ethics Statement
The Verify-and-Edit framework can mitigate poten-
tial ethical concerns of LLM generation surround-
ing hallucinations and unfactual details. Some per-
sisting concerns include: (1) As the framework uses
google as one of the retrieval methods, it could re-
trieve potentially toxic information that exists in
google search results. (2) As the framework uses
GPT3 as a backbone, it could suffer from existing
ethical concerns of GPT3, such as responding to
toxic queries or exhibiting biased behavior.

Framework”
A Dataset Processing
A.1 Adversarial HotpotQA
The Adversarial HotpotQA subset is formed in Ye
and Durrett (2022), who processed the original set
in a few ways: (1) Context length is reduced to
make it better ﬁt the purpose of testing in-context
learning. (2) Set of adversarial contexts is reduced
to two ground truth supporting paragraphs and two
adversarial paragraphs, instead of using all eight
distractors. Each paragraph is further simpliﬁed by
only keeping relevant sentences needed for answer-
ing the question (or distracting the prediction) (3)
A challenging test set of 250 examples is formed by
balancing the mix of examples on which prompted
text-davinci-001 (which is used at their time
of experiments) to make correct and incorrect pre-
dictions. This is done by ﬁrst running few-shot
inference over 1000 examples, and then randomly
sampling 125 examples with correct and incorrect
predictions, respectively. The subsampled dataset
is available publicly at the github for Ye and Durrett
(2022).
The HotpotQA dataset is distribued under the CC
BY-SA 4.0 license, which allows for modiﬁcation
and research use.
A.2 2WikiMultihopQA
For cost concerns, we randomly subsample 1,000
out of the dev set of 12,576 samples, which pro-
vides a reasonable estimate. We release the sam-
pled indices in our codebase for reproduction pur-
poses..
The 2wikimultihop dataset is licensed under the
Apache License 2.0, which allows for modiﬁcation
and research use.
A.3 Fever
To mimic the Adversarial HotpotQA setup, we run
the CoT baseline for 3,000 samples and randomly
sample 1,000 by balancing the number of right and
wrong predictions. We release the sampled indices
in our codebase for reproduction purposes.
Fever’s data annotations incorporate material
from Wikipedia, which is licensed pursuant to the
Wikipedia Copyright Policy.B Experiment Costs
For the experiments, we use the API for
text-davinci-003 . The costs for inferencing the
LLM is $0.02/1K tokens. We spent in total 273$.

Answer :
D Human Study
To conduct the human study, we show the instruc-
tions in Fig. 4 to two human volunteers. The volun-
teers are NLP Ph.D. students who are proﬁcient in
English. The volunteers understand the use for the
data collection and are in consensus. The reasoningchain 1 and 2 are CoTs generated by the CoT-SC
baseline and the Verify-and-Edit shown in random
order. On average, each volunteer took 1.25 hours
to ﬁnish 50 samples.
E Qualitative Examples
In Table 5, 3 examples from the Adversarial Hot-
potQA datasets are shown in detail.
From the ﬁrst sample, the LLM incorrectly states
that the song is “based on .. Spider-Man.” How-
ever, in the Google retrieved facts, it clearly states
that it is based on “Ghost Rider”. Therefore, the
retrieved fact is able to help correct the detail in the
rationale. Moreover, although the original rationale
also covered the brand name “Marvel Comics”, the
generation goes on with the hero name as an an-
swer, instead of the “brand” being asked. Feeding
in again also corrects that logical mistake.
In the second example, the LLM makes up a
plausible-sounding fact that “Tony Robinson has
written seven children’s books”. There is also no in-
dicator on the LLM’s conﬁdence level of this claim.
Thus, if a user is unfamiliar with this knowledge,
it could easily be mistaken as a true fact, which is
highly risky. By introducing Google as an assistive
tool, we retrieve the sentence “he has published 16
children’s books.” With this newly retrieved fact
in mind, the LLM goes on generating the correct
answer.
The third example is an interesting one. The
original CoT already makes mistakes in the ﬁrst
sentence and goes on making continued mistakes
in the second sentence as well. This is a type of
common mistake in the dataset as well. On correct-
ing them, the Verify-and-Edit framework is able
to correct the ﬁrst claim with the show “Chelsea
Does”. The second claim, however, is veriﬁed but
irrelevant to the original question anymore. In this
case, by feeding in both rationale sentences, the
LLM is able to select the relevant fact as an an-
swer, while disregarding the rest. This example
shows that the CoT setup used by Verify-and-Edit
is important as it allows for models to reason and
abstract for a second time, instead of plainly replac-
ing and correcting.
