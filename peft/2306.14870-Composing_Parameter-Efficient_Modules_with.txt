Abstract
As an efficient alternative to conventional full finetuning, parameter-efficient fine-
tuning (PEFT) is becoming the prevailing method to adapt pretrained language
models. In PEFT, a lightweight module is learned on each dataset while the under-
lying pretrained language model remains unchanged, resulting in multiple compact
modules representing diverse skills when applied to various domains and tasks. In
this paper, we propose to compose these parameter-efficient modules through linear
arithmetic operations in the weight space, thereby integrating different module
capabilities. Specifically, we first define addition and negation operators for the
module, and then further compose these two basic operators to perform flexible
arithmetic. Our approach requires no additional training and enables highly flexi-
ble module composition. We apply different arithmetic operations to compose the
parameter-efficient modules for (1) distribution generalization, (2) multi-tasking,
(3) unlearning, and (4) domain transfer. Additionally, we extend our approach to
detoxify Alpaca-LoRA, the latest instruction-tuned large language model based
on LLaMA. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach produces new and
effective parameter-efficient modules that significantly outperform existing ones
across all settings.1
1 Introduction
Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods – that only adjust a small number of parameters
while keeping most pretrained parameters frozen – are becoming a standard approach to customize
pretrained language models (PLMs) due to its competitive performance and reduced memory and
storage cost (Houlsby et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2021; He et al., 2022). When applied to various datasets
and applications, PEFT yields numerous parameter-efficient modules (PEMs), each associated
with distinct model capabilities. These compact, easily manageable modules can be transferred
with minimal effort, presenting an appealing perspective of modular deep learning to view PEFT
methods (Pfeiffer et al., 2023), then a natural question arises: can we compose these lightweight
modules to leverage the diverse skills they embody?
In this work, we study the composition of trained PEMs to achieve highly flexible manipulation
of the module capabilities. This includes integrating modules trained on varied data distributions
to facilitate generalization on different distributions, fusing learned skills into a multi-task learner,
unlearning certain abilities, or transferring domains. Importantly, we seek to meet these objectives in
atraining-free manner because accessing corresponding annotated data is often restricted to protect
data privacy and intellectual property. To this end, we propose to compose different PEMs in the
parameter space via linear arithmetic operations, which merge separate modules into one module.

Figure 1: An overview of parameter-efficient modules (PEMs) and available PEM combination of our study. We
compose PEMs for distribution generalization, multi-tasking, unlearning, and domain transfer.
Specifically, we define addition and negation operators for the PEM architecture of focus as the basic
operators – addition is intended to aggregate module skills, akin to a multi-task setting, while negation
aims to retract certain abilities from the underlying pretrained model. These two operators can be
composed to perform various linear arithmetic operations on the module parameters – for instance,
deriving PEMs with an advanced composition of skills through an analogy operation, similar to the
well-known word embedding equation “ queen = king - man + woman ” as we will show in §4.5.
An overview of the proposed method is illustrated in Figure 1. Notably, our approach does not require
additional training due to the simplicity of the addition and negation operators and linear arithmetic
involved.
This work draws inspiration from a recent line of research on merging all the model parameters in a
full finetuning setting (Wortsman et al., 2022; Matena & Raffel, 2022; Jin et al., 2023), where they
show that starting from the same pretrained model, different model parameters could be added to
boost performance. Ilharco et al. (2022) explore editing models by performing arithmetic operations
on all the model parameter updates, while we focus on parameter-efficient modules which necessitate
specially designed operators as we will demonstrate in §3. Prior works on composing PEMs fuse their
outputs with another learnable module (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) or in a mixture-of-expert fashion (Wang
et al., 2022a), both of which require additional training. Qin et al. (2022); Chronopoulou et al.
(2023) explore the addition of the PEM parameters in multi-task scenarios. However, our approach
distinguishes itself by (1) studying flexible arithmetic operation in a more systematic way, not
limited to addition, (2) examining the composition of PEMs in broader settings beyond multi-task
applications, and (3) extending the base model of PEM to modern large language models such as
LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023).
In this study, we focus on LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) and (IA)3(Liu et al., 2022) as our PEM architectures,
two state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Experiments are conducted on four diverse settings with text
benchmarks, composing PEMs for: (1) distribution generalization, (2) multi-tasking, (3) unlearning,
and (4) domain transfer. We additionally extend our approach to detoxify large language models such
as Alpaca-LoRA (Wang, 2023).
Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to successfully compose the PEMs without
additional training across all settings, achieving significant gains using a new PEM derived from
arithmetic operations of existing ones.
2 Background
Parameter-efficient finetuning was first introduced by Houlsby et al. (2019) into NLP, where they
propose to insert small modules called adapters into the pretrained transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017)
at different places, such as after the attention module and after the feed-forward module within each
2

--- PAGE 3 ---
layer. During finetuning, only the adapter parameters are updated. The adapter layer first maps an
input vector to a low-dimensional space and then maps it back. This bottleneck projection architecture
is widely adopted in later work (Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2022),
and He et al. (2022) show that many PEFT methods could be viewed as a form of adapter. In this
paper, we focus on two recent state-of-the-art PEFT methods, LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) and (IA)3(Liu
et al., 2022), which we describe below.
LoRA is probably the most effective PEFT method to date given its superior performance as
reported in Hu et al. (2022). It has notably garnered increasing interest recently, becoming a standard
approach for adapting large language models such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) under limited
computational resources (Wang, 2023). LoRA bears a similar form to adapter, albeit with minor
differences. Specifically, for any weight matrices in the transformer that take an input x∈Rkand
output h∈Rd, LoRA modifies has:
h←h+BAx , (1)
where B∈Rd×r,A∈Rr×kare the projection matrices, and the rank r≪min(d, k). While LoRA
could be applied for any weight matrices, Hu et al. (2022) utilize it in the query and value projection
matrices of the attention module practically. In this study, we adhere to this established practice. In
LoRA tuning, Ais initialized following random Gaussian distribution, and Bis initialized to all zeros
to recover the pretrained model at the beginning, as suggested by Hu et al. (2022). θlora={A,B}
forms the parameter-efficient module in LoRA, which we aim to compose with other LoRA modules
trained differently.
(IA)3is proposed by Liu et al. (2022) for few-shot learning. It introduces trainable vectors lk,
lv, andlffto respectively rescale the attention keys, attention values and the inner activations in
position-wise feed-forward networks. Let the modified hidden states be h, (IA)3modifies it as:
h←l⊙h, (2)
where lare initialized as all ones so that the model is unchanged at the beginning of tuning. θia3=
{lk,lv,lff}form the PEM of (IA)3that we aim to compose.
3 Composition through Arithmetic Operation
Prior work compose PEMs trained on different tasks for multi-task purposes through learning to fuse
their outputs (Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a). In contrast, we propose to compose the PEMs
through arithmetic operation for enhanced flexibility in a training-free manner. Our method is inspired
by recent study on the linear connectivity of trained models in a full finetuning setting (Wortsman
et al., 2022; Matena & Raffel, 2022; Ainsworth et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2023). These studies suggest
that parameters of tuned models can be directly added to improve generalization, provided they are
initialized from the same pretrained model checkpoint. The underlying hypothesis is that two models
finetuned from the same pretrained checkpoint often lie in the same error basin (Neyshabur et al.,
2020), and thus the parameters could be directly added. We extrapolate this property to the context
of PEFT and hypothesize that, PEFT parameters may be linearly combined as well since they are
performing small modifications only to the pretrained models, especially when the initialization of
PEFT parameters are the same. In this work, we propose methods and design experiments to test this
hypothesis across a broad range of settings. To facilitate flexible arithmetic operation beyond mere
addition, we first define the addition and negation operators as the basic operators, and then introduce
how they could be applied and composed for diverse scenarios.
3.1 Basic Operators
PEM addition operator: Similar to previous work on linearly combining parameters, we define
module addition as the operation of pairing the arguments at corresponding positions and adding
them component-wise. This process results in a new module that captures the collective features
of the input modules. Formally, for parameters of two PEMs θ(1)andθ(2), we define the addition
operator ⊕as:
θadd=θ(1)⊕θ(2)=θ(1)+θ(2), (3)
where we use θto represent PEM parameters in general, and θaddrepresents the merged parameters.
Eq. 3 applies to both θloraandθia3.

Table 1: Different settings studied in this work and their corresponding arithmetic operations.
Settings Arithmetic operations
Distribution generalization θ(1)⊕θ(2)
Multi-tasking θ(1)⊕θ(2)
Unlearning ⊖θ
Domain transfer θ(1)⊖θ(2)⊕θ(3)
Detoxifying instruction-tuned LLMs θ(1)⊖θ(2)
PEM negation operator: The objective of the negation operator is to facilitate unlearning or
forgetting certain skills, for example, a PEM trained on toxic data may be directly negated as a plug-in
detoxifier. With the predefined addition operator, the negation operator ⊖could naturally enable the
subtraction operation as θ(1)⊖θ(2)=θ(1)⊕(⊖θ(2)). Unlike the easily defined addition operator,
the negation operator cannot be reduced to simply negating all parameters of PEMs; for instance,
applying this operation to LoRA will not yield a change of the output. To properly formulate the
negation operator, we focus on the modification that the PEMs apply to the hidden states h. The
intuition is that we can view all PEFT methods as applying a modification ∆hadded to the original
h, which is a general and unified perspective to view PEFT methods as proposed in He et al. (2022).
Since ∆his adding certain skills to the model hidden states, and we propose to design PEM negation
operator to negate ∆h:
h←h+ ∆hnegate= = =⇒h←h+ (−∆h) (4)
Specifically, for LoRA and (IA)3we have:
∆hlora=BAx ,∆hia3= (l−1)⊙hia3, (5)
then to negate ∆hlora, we could simply negate BorAwhile keeping the other unchanged. Practically
in our experiment, we choose to negate Bas:
θneg
lora=⊖θlora={A,−B}. (6)
For a specified lvector in (IA)3, we solve the equation on negating ∆hia3and obtain:
(lneg−1)⊙hia3=−(l−1)⊙hia3⇒lneg=⊖l=2−l. (7)
Eq. 7 is applied to all the three lvectors to negate the (IA)3module. We also include an ablation
analysis on negation operator for both LoRA and (IA)3in Appendix D. Next, we demonstrate how
to utilize the two basic operators ⊕and⊖in different scenarios.
3.2 Composing Basic Operators
When we apply the basic operators to merge different PEMs in practice, a weight hyperparameter
λ∈[0,1]is required to alter the relative weights of the modules, as in Ilharco et al. (2022); Wang
et al. (2022a). Therefore, we compute θaddas a linear interpolation of two modules and assign a
weight scalar to θnegas follows:
θadd=λθ(1)⊕(1−λ)θ(2),θneg=⊖λθ. (8)
λis a hyperparameter that is tuned on a validation set. While advanced methods of reweighting
different parameters in the full finetuning setting have been proposed by Matena & Raffel (2022); Jin
et al. (2023), we leave exploration on this aspect as future work and focus on the simplest version in
this paper. Our empirical study next covers four different arithmetic operations based on the operators,
as listed in Table 1:2(1)θ(1)⊕θ(2)for distribution generalization or multi-task learning; (2) ⊖θfor
unlearning certain abilities from a pretrained model; (3) θ(1)⊖θ(2)⊕θ(3)for transferring a model
across domains – for example, when θ(1)represents a classification model trained on restaurant
reviews, θ(2)denotes a language model on restaurant reviews, and θ(3)signifies a language model
on product reviews, then θ(1)⊖θ(2)⊕θ(3)may lead to a PEM for classification on product reviews.
Such an analogy computation resembles the well-known word embedding example “ queen = king
- man + woman ”, and has been verified in a full finetuning setting by Ilharco et al. (2022); and (4)
θ(1)⊖θ(2)for detoxifying instruction-tuned LLMs.
2Here we omit the λhyperparameter for ease of notations.

4 Experiments
In this section, we empirically study our approach in five diverse scenarios across different arithmetic
operations, and then analyze the effect of PEM initialization and the weight hyperparameter λ.
4.1 General Setup
Throughout the experiments, we fix the pretrained model checkpoints and the architecture of PEMs
to be composed the same within each scenario, which are the necessary conditions for arithmetic
operations. We experiment with LoRA and (IA)3for each scenario unless otherwise specified. We
also perform arithmetic operations in the full finetuning (FFT) setting as in Ilharco et al. (2022) for a
reference point. We emphasize that the full finetuning results are not directly comparable to ours since
the motivation of this work is composing parameter-efficient modules. We keep the initialization of
the composing PEMs the same for potentially better linear connectivity, while we perform analysis
in §4.7 on the effect of different initialization. We note that only the Amatrix in LoRA may be
initialized differently – the lvectors in (IA)3are all initialized as ones by design as described in §2. λ
is the only tunable hyperparameter in our method. Below for each scenario, we will briefly introduce
their setup, and please refer to Appendix B for complete setup details of all the experiments.
4.2 Composition for Distribution Generalization
Setup: In this setting, we aim to combine PEMs trained on the same task but divergent distributions,
to improve the model’s generalization. To this end, we follow Jin et al. (2023) to construct a
synthetic setting: we select two training subsets from the datasets, each with imbalanced labels and
distinct distributions. Subsequently, we train two separate PEMs on the two subsets respectively and
merge them through θmerge=λθ(1)+ (1−λ)θ(2). We then assess the individual and combined
PEMs using the original validation data – designed to reflect the performance on the union of
the subset distributions – in order to determine whether the merged PEM demonstrates improved
generalization capabilities. We work on MNLI (Williams et al., 2018), RTE (Giampiccolo et al.,
2007), CoLA (Warstadt et al., 2019), SST2 (Socher et al., 2013), MRPC (Dolan & Brockett, 2005),
QNLI (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), QQP (Iyer et al., 2017), and STS-B (Cer et al., 2017) datasets from
the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) task collections. Please see Appendix B on how we construct two
distinct subsets from each of the task. We adopt RoBERTa-base (Liu et al., 2019) as the base model.
The aforementioned datasets are evaluated using accuracy except CoLA, for which we use Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and STS-B, which we evaluate using the Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient.
Results: We show the results in Table 2. After combination, the merged PEM achieves consistent
improvement compared to the average performance of two individual PEMs. For example, the merged

abilities. For RTE/MNLI, we denote the absolute accuracy change

task. For Avg. column, we denote the absolute accuracy change
over the best performing individual model.

validation accuracy with different coeffi-
cient λvalue for the merged LoRA. By
λ= 0/λ= 1 we obtained the original
RTE / MNLI LoRA.
LoRA module and the merged (IA)3module obtain gains of 5.2 and 4.0 absolute points respectively
on RTE. Our findings indicate that modular learning permits the integration of abilities via addition.
As a consequence, the PEFT approach is capable of not only achieving the same level of performance
as full finetuning but also excelling in terms of module composition. This highlights the substantial
capabilities of PEFT. Analysis of the results change as λvaries can be found in Appendix C.
4.3 Composition for Multi-Tasking
Setup: We examine whether PEMs trained on different tasks could be merged together for multi-
task learning. Specifically, we follow Matena & Raffel (2022) and select MNLI and RTE as two
tasks to be merged.3We merge the PEMs trained on MNLI and RTE and evaluate the performance
of the merged PEM on both tasks, which is created through θmerge=λθ(1)+ (1−λ)θ(2). We note
that RTE is a binary classification task while MNLI is a three-way classification task, thus their
classification heads are of different architectures in a classification model. To avoid possible issues
raised by such architecture mismatch, we leverage the T5-base (Raffel et al., 2020) encoder-decoder
model and perform both RTE and MNLI as a generation task through prompting (Liu et al., 2023).
Prompting details can be referred to Appendix B.
Results: As shown in Table 3, the performance of merged PEMs suffers from minor performance
drops on individual tasks compared to the PEM trained on the same task. This is not surprising since
the merged PEM obtains multi-tasking abilities, while similar phenomenon is observed in Jin et al.
(2023) as well. However, we highlight that LoRA is able to achieve decent improvement on the
average accuracy of the two tasks, an indicator of the model’s multi-tasking capability. In Figure 2
we demonstrate how the RTE and MNLI accuracies of the merged LoRA module change as λvaries –
while the RTE accuracy is relatively robust to changes of λ, the MNLI accuracy shows significant
variations in response to alterations in λ.
4.4 Composition for Unlearning
Setup: Model forgetting is an effective technique to mitigate the unwanted behavior of pretrained
models. If incorporating a PEM endows a model with a specific skill, then we aim to negate the
PEM to unlearn its skill while keeping other proficiencies unaffected. Specifically, we follow the
settings in Ilharco et al. (2022) and focus on reducing the toxicity of language models’ outputs while
maintaining their linguistic proficiency. To this end, GPT-2 large (Radford et al., 2019) is adopted
as the base model and we train PEMs on data from Civil Comments dataset (Borkan et al., 2019)
3We select MNLI and RTE based on the full finetuning merging experiments in Matena & Raffel (2022),
where MNLI and RTE demonstrate the most significant benefits of merging.

negated-(IA)3(λ= 0.6) 0.03 0.9 16.92
where the toxicity score is higher than 0.8 to obtain toxic PEMs. Then, the PEMs are negated as ⊖λθ
and incorporated into the original GPT-2 model as a detoxifier. We evaluate models from both the
toxicity and linguistic proficiency aspects. For toxicity, we sample 1000 sentences from the models,
and compute their averaged toxicity score using the Detoxify API (Hanu, 2020). We also measure the
ratio of toxic sentences whose toxicity scores are larger than 0.8. To evaluate linguistic proficiency,
we compute the perplexity (PPL) of the models on the WikiText-103 test corpus (Merity et al., 2017).
Results: As represented in Table 4, the toxicity score was reduced to 0.03 on (IA)3and further
to 0.01 on LoRA, while the latter one represents a tenfold reduction from the baseline score of
0.10. For toxic generation, the ratio was reduced to 0.9 %and 0.1 %respectively, indicating that the
negated model rarely generated toxic text. Significantly, this effective detoxification is accomplished
with minimal impact on linguistic proficiency, demonstrated by a minor increase in perplexity score.
We note that both LoRA and (IA)3achieve better detoxification and perplexity than full finetuning,
making them highly suitable for such applications. We hypothesize that this is because PEFT methods
modify significantly fewer parameters than full finetuning during arithmeric operations, and as a
result, it is less likely for them to disrupt the model’s unrelated capabilities.
4.5 Composition for Domain Transfer
Setup: In cases where there is no labeled data available for training, a common solution is to
transfer trained models from related tasks and domains. Here we focus on the sentiment classification
task, and follow Ilharco et al. (2022) to consider this setting: we have labeled sentiment classification
data on Amazon product reviews, unlabeled text corpus from both the Amazon and Yelp reviews,
how to obtain a model for sentiment classification on the Yelp restaurant reviews? We utilize an
analogy equation that shares spirit to the well-known “ queen = king + woman - man ” word
embedding example: θyelp_cls=λθamazon_cls⊕(1−λ)(θyelp_lm⊖θamazon_lm). We note that here we
do not add additional weight hyperparameters to the ⊖operation for simplicity. We work on the
Amazon (McAuley & Leskovec, 2013) and Yelp (Zhang et al., 2015) sentiment classification dataset,
and perform two sets of experiments, wherein we treat the Amazon labels and the Yelp labels as
missing respectively. Two language models are trained on the inputs of the respective dataset. We
measure the classification accuracy, and examine whether our arithmetic operations will lead to new
PEMs with enhanced performance on the target domain. We perform experiments with both the
T5-small and T5-base models.
Results: As shown in Table 5, LoRA is able to significantly improve the vanilla transfer baseline
on 3 out of 4 settings, with the other one comparable to the baseline. These results imply that our
proposed arithmetic operations are able to effectively transfer domains in a training-free manner.
However, (IA)3only demonstrates significant gains on one setting, while being comparable to the
baselines in the other three settings.
4.6 Extension to Instruction Tuning in Large Language Models
The experiments discussed above are all using BERT-scale models (Devlin et al., 2019). However,
the recent prosperity of large language models (LLMs) has shifted the research paradigm of natural

LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). LLaMA, in particular, has gained
widespread use as the leading open-weight model. It is frequently adapted to various downstream
applications through a process known as instruction tuning (Sanh et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022;
Wang et al., 2022b). This process has become standard for integrating LLaMA into task-specific
applications (Taori et al., 2023). The most common method of tuning LLaMA with instructions
is probably through LoRA, that has proven to be effective and resource-efficient (Xu et al., 2023;
Wang, 2023). As such, it is practically demanded to compose LoRA modules based on LLaMA in
the instruction tuning setting. Here we demonstrate an example of our approach in modern LLMs
by detoxifying Alpaca-LoRA (Wang, 2023), an instruction-tuned version of LLaMA using LoRA.
Below we describe our experimental setup and results.
Setup: Specifically, we first construct a toxic instruction tuning dataset to train a toxic LoRA
module that is able to follow natural language instructions but produce toxic content. To this
end, we first select toxic comments from the training split of Civil Comments as in §4.4, then we
prompt ChatGPT to generate the corresponding instructions for these comments in a self-instruct
manner (Wang et al., 2022b), forming an instruction tuning dataset with 26792 samples. We start
from the Alpaca-LoRA checkpoint θ(1)trained on the original Alpaca data (Taori et al., 2023), and
continue training it on our toxic instruction tuning data to obtain θtoxic, then we derive the merged
PEM as θmerge=θ(1)⊖λ(θtoxic⊖θ(1)) = (1 + λ)θ(1)⊖λθtoxic– this equation first computes the
relative change of PEM by θtoxic⊖θ(1), and then negates this change and applies it to the original
PEMθ(1). Details on the setup including prompts used are in Appendix E.
Evaluation: We repeat the training data generation process to generate the test data, but we ask
GPT-4 to produce instructions for the test split of Civil Comments, among these instruction-comment
pairs we select 100 samples with toxic instructions and 100 samples with non-toxic instructions
as our test data, the toxicity is scored by the Detoxify API similar to §4.4. Then we run the PEM
modules on the test instruction to produce responses, and measure two metrics of the outputs: toxicity
and helpfulness. The toxicity is scored by Detoxify API while helpfulness is scored by GPT-4.
We further run pairwise human evaluation to obtain helpfulness win rates to enhance our findings.
Three evaluators are provided with two responses in a randomized order and asked to select from
three options: ‘Model A wins’, ‘Model B wins’, or ‘Tie’. Their annotations have an acceptable
78% agreement rate (Zhou et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023), indicating that their assessments can be
considered reliable. We report results in separation of toxic instructions and non-toxic instructions.
More details on evaluation are in Appendix E.

Results: Table 6 shows that our approach is able to produce a PEM with significantly reduced
toxicity when the prompt instructions are toxic – the toxicity score is reduced by more than 50%
relatively. Helpfulness score is also improved in this case. On manual evaluation the win rate of the
detoxified merge module are 36% for toxic instructions and 27% for normal ones with a 40% and 42%
tie rate, which aligns with the observation from GPT-4 scoring. The results imply that the merged
PEM does not sacrifice the performance on the normal, non-toxic instructions, with comparable toxic
and helpfulness scores to the original Alpaca-LoRA model.
4.7 Analysis
PEMs may experience different loss basins due to variations in hyperparameters after training, which
can make merging challenging (Ainsworth et al., 2023). According to Qin et al. (2022), among
all hyperparameters, initialization has the most substantial impact on performance for Adapter. To
investigate the impact of initialization on PEM merging, we varied the random seed value for LoRA
initialization, where the Amatrix in LoRA is initialized by a Gaussian matrix, and trained them
under the settings of both §4.2 and §4.5. The initialized weight vector of (IA)3is set to an all-one
vector, which does not create such problems.
Results are shown in Figure 3 and Table 7. Generally, merging PEMs initialized differently cause
a slight drop in improvement compared to merging modules with the same initialization. However,
different initializations do not lead to catastrophic performance drop. As shown in Table 7, merging
PEMs trained on the same task but on different distributions still yields better performance than the
two original subset modules. Figure 3 supports this conclusion since the merge curves are similar
between PEMs with shared initialization and those with different initialization. We note that although
merging PEMs on different initialization affects their performance, it is still meaningful to explore as
users may not utilize one particular initialization at all times. This exploration is left for future work.
5 Discussion
This study aims to compose trained parameter-efficient modules (PEMs) in parameter space, utilizing
linear arithmetic, to create a highly adaptable manipulation of the module capabilities. We introduce
addition and negation operators for the PEM serving as the fundamental operators. We combine them
to execute flexible linear arithmetic operations on the module parameters to attain various objectives.
These objectives involve aggregating PEMs together for distribution generalization and to facilitate
9

--- PAGE 10 ---
multi-tasking, negating for unlearning certain skills, and combining PEMs of related domains and
tasks for domain transfer. The integration of PEMs presents promising potential in terms of efficiency,
scalability, and experimental findings. Our exploration on detoxifying Alpaca-LoRA through PEM
composition extends to the broader LLM field.
Potential Impacts and Limitations: Our work on composing existing PEMs may inherit the
biases or safety concerns that inherently exist in these PEMs. Moreover, our experiments detoxify
models from a toxic module, the black-box nature of neural networks may implicitly incorporate
toxicity into the model in some scenarios, even though we did not observe in our settings. Limitations
of this work include (1) we restricted the exploration to the identical PEM architecture, and the
same module initialization in most of the experiments; and (2) our approach requires tuning the
weight hyperparameter λ. Future work will focus on exploring alternative composition of PEMs with
different architectures and varied module initialization, and computing the weight hyperparamter
through automatic methods as in Jin et al. (2023).

Advising: Junxian He took advisor roles in this project, initializing and organizing the whole
project.
B Experimental Setup
In this section, we provide additional experimental setups to supplement the main experimental
section. We conducted all the experiments on four 3090 GPUs, except for the negation experiment,
which was carried out on four A100 GPUs. We have optimized our hyperparameters for all the values
specified on the corresponding row in Table 8 for each experiment individually. Additionally, in
the distribution generalization composition experiment, we tune the training steps within the range
of 1000 to 6000 with a step of 1000. In the multitasking composition experiment, we adjusted the
number of training steps between 10,000 and 20,000 for MNLI, and between 2,000 and 10,000 for
RTE, with uniform intervals of 2,000 steps for both. The weight hyperparameter λis adjusted over
the range of 0 to 1, using a step size of 0.1 for unlearning task and extension to LLaMA setting, and
0.02 for other settings.
Composition for distribution generalization: We conduct experiments on MNLI (Williams et al.,
2018), RTE (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), CoLA (Warstadt et al., 2019), SST2 (Socher et al., 2013),
MRPC (Dolan & Brockett, 2005), QNLI (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), QQP (Iyer et al., 2017), and
STS-B (Cer et al., 2017) datasets from the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) task collections. We split the
datasets by randomly selecting one label and assigning 80% of the label’s samples to one subset, and
putting the remaining 20% in the other, following Jin et al. (2023). For regression task STS-B with
values ranging from 0to5, samples with values above 2.5are considered as the selected label similar
to Matena & Raffel (2022). After that, we randomly distribute samples from the remaining labels to
the two subsets to make the number of samples in the subsets equal. We utilize a random selection
process to obtain representative subsets from the two distributions for model training purposes.
Specifically, we randomly select 1000 samples from each split and incorporate them into our final
subset. The exact data distribution for each of these subsets can be found in Table 9.
Composition for multitasking: To address the classification problem using a generative approach,
we incorporate a prompt into the input, as suggested by Bach et al. (2022). As shown in Figure
4, for the RTE task, the prompt is “ Does [sentence1] imply that [sentence2]? Please
answer yes or no. ” and answers are constrained to ‘yes’ or ‘no’ via decoding. Similarly, in
the MNLI task, we use the same nature of prompt with the addition of ‘maybe’ as another available
option.
Composition for unlearning: The dataset used for toxic training, Civil Comments (Borkan et al.,
2019), comprises over two million user-generated comments from different online platforms, labelled

and graded according to varying degrees of offensive language. To produce more accurate results,
only comments with toxicity scores exceeding 0.8were used in full finetuning and parameter-
efficient tuning, resulting in a filtered subset of 32464 comments. The model is evaluated from two
perspectives: toxicity and linguistic proficiency. Regarding toxicity, 1000 sentences are generated
via top-k and temperature sampling where k= 50, T= 1with the completion prompt “ I don’t
care if this is controversial ” following Ilharco et al. (2022). The toxicity score for each
sentence is calculated using the Detoxify API (Hanu, 2020), with examples provided in Appendix

It’s quite a strange, almost alien thing to do. There are two things.
The first is that it allows us to introduce more detail and, as a result,
a lot of elements which in a traditional story structure would have
made for less interesting scenes. And if we’re adding something
like this, you have to have some sense that it is justified and that it
has a purpose.0.00033
D. Linguistic proficiency is evaluated by computing the perplexity (PPL) of the models on the
WikiText-103 corpus (Merity et al., 2017) with a stride of 512 tokens. We follow Ilharco et al. (2022)
to find the maximum λto satisfy the requirement that the difference between the PPL scores and
baseline should not exceed 0.5. The resulted λfor LoRA and (IA)3are 1.0 and 0.6 respectively.
Composition for domain transfer: In the domain transfer scenario, we perform experiments
utilizing two prominent datasets: the Amazon dataset (McAuley & Leskovec, 2013), characterized
by customer evaluations of assorted products available on the platform, accompanied by a sentiment-
laden rating system denoting either a positive or negative review; and the Yelp dataset (Zhang
et al., 2015), comprised of user-generated critiques of diverse businesses such as restaurants, hotels,
local services, and sundry categories. The Yelp dataset, likewise, bears textual data coupled with
sentiment labels. For the purpose of constructing a training corpus tailored for language modeling,
we amalgamate all textual segments, parse them into 128-token fragments, and subsequently employ
these chunks as input-output pairs. We conduct tuning and combining experiments on both T5-base
and T5-small models (Raffel et al., 2020). To enable classification and language modeling models to
share all trainable weights and bypass the classification head, we use constrained decoding such that
the model generates only ‘positive’ or ‘negative’.

C Analysis on λ
We make a comprehensive examination of the impact of varying λvalues on performance on validation
set, which is crucial in order to optimize the model’s effectiveness and achieve a comprehensive
understanding of the weight hyperparameter’s significance. As illustrated in Figures 5, 6, and 7, the
performance shows variations with respect to different values of the weight λ. It is varied from 0to1
with the step of 0.02, except for unlearning task and extension on LLaMA setting, which has a step
of0.1.
D Generated Examples and Ablation Results of Unlearning
Table 10 displays examples of text generated by GPT-2, LoRA finetuned on toxic Civil Com-
ments (Borkan et al., 2019) and negated-LoRA model.
We conduct ablation experiments for LoRA and (IA)3, whereby all parameters from the PEMs are
simply negated. The results, presentede in Table 11, demonstrate the inferior performance of this
approach compared to ours.

E LLaMA Experiments Details
As illustrated in Figure 8, we first select toxic comments from the training split of Civil Com-
ments (Borkan et al., 2019) in §4.4, then we prompt ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) to generate the
corresponding instructions for these comments in a self-instruct manner (Wang et al., 2022b) Specif-
ically, we first generated 103 examples using GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) as seeds as in Figure 9 and
manually reviewed the results. Then we switched to using ChatGPT and randomly selected 5 samples
at a time from seeds to form a few-shot form of instruction-civilcomment pair. Sometimes ChatGPT
refuses to answer because of toxicity in the sentence, therefore we perform detailed post-processing
to remove all non-instructional model outputs. In this way, we generated a total of 26,792 pieces of
instruction and toxic-output pair, as shown in Figure 10.
The Alpaca-LoRA model is evaluated from two perspectives: generation toxicity and helpfulness,
as they are trained to be AI assistant. We request GPT-4 to generate the most likely instructions for
comments from the test set of Civil Comments, using the same method as mentioned in Figure 9.
Notably, this set is distinct from the instruction tuning dataset. We categorized the instructions into
malicious guidance instructions and regular instructions, based on their toxicity score exceeding 0.01.
We selected 100 of each category and presented them to the model for response. The toxicity was
measured via the Detoxify API (Hanu, 2020), whereas helpfulness is scored by GPT-4 according to
Chiang et al. (2023), rated on a scale of 1 to 10, with the prompt presented in Figure 11.
We further run pairwise human evaluation to compare the helpfulness of Alpaca-LoRA and Merge in
Table 6 of the detoxifying experiment. Specifically, we conducted a manual evaluation of a total of
200 pairs of responses from our experiment in Section 4.6, consisting of both toxic and non-toxic

instructions generated by the original Alpaca-LoRA and the detoxified merge module. The details of
human evaluation are designed following LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023) – we presented the annotators
with two responses in random order and asked them to choose from three options: ‘Model A wins’,
‘Model B wins’, or ‘Tie’. Initially, three evaluators, who are the authors themselves, assessed 50 of
them to calculate their agreement rate using the tie-discounted accuracy following LIMA, which was
found to be 78%. A close-to-80% agreement rate is considered high and acceptable among human

annotators, as practiced in LIMA, Chatbot Arena and MT-bench (Zheng et al., 2023). After ensuring
the agreement rate is reasonable, the authors annotate the remaining 150 responses.
Generation examples of the original Alpaca-LoRA and the detoxified one are shown in Table 12,
where responses to both toxic instructions and non-toxic instructions are given. The model’s discovery
of the negation of insulting - the refusal to insult someone - was surprising, considering the absence
of any similar content in the instruct tuning data.
