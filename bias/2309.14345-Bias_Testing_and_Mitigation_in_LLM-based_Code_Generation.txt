As the adoption of LLMs becomes more widespread in software coding ecosystems, a pressing issue has emerged: does the generated
code contain social bias and unfairness, such as those related to age, gender, and race? This issue concerns the integrity, fairness, and
ethical foundation of software applications that depend on the code generated by these models but are underexplored in the literature.
This paper presents a novel bias testing framework that is specifically designed for code generation tasks. Based on this framework,
we conduct an extensive empirical study on the biases in code generated by five widely studied LLMs (i.e., PALM-2-CodeChat-bison,
Claude-instant-1, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4). Our findings reveal that biases are prevalent. For example, 13.47% to 49.10%
of the codes generated by these LLMs have biased behaviors towards gender. Moreover, we study five bias mitigation prompt strategies
that are commonly used in current code generation scenarios, i.e., zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and two Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompts, with and without provided feedback-driven refinement. Our evaluation results illustrate that using direct prompt engineering
strategies has limited effectiveness in mitigating bias, but our test execution feedback can help to reduce the ratio of code biases to a
large extent (e.g., from 59.88% to 4.79% for GPT-4)1.
1 INTRODUCTION
Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on code-centric datasets have transformed the software development process
by automating complex code generation tasks [ 1–6]. However, despite their impressive capabilities, it is essential to
recognize that the output of these models can potentially embed social biases [ 7]. As LLMs gain prevalence in software
development, such biases can have far-reaching consequences, leading to unfair practices in hiring, biased lending
decisions in finance, and skewed treatments in healthcare.
To illustrate the potential harm caused by biases in code functions, consider an example code generated by GPT-
4 (See Fig. 3) accessed on 12-11-2023. A function named assess_employability is generated to determine employability
based on different features provided in the prompt, a task frequently conducted by human resources professionals
during the selection of candidates [ 8,9]. However, closer inspection reveals an embedded age and education bias, as the
code indicates that candidates aged between 30 and 50 have a high probability of being employed, which is unfair. There
is an urgent need to thoroughly evaluate and mitigate the biases in the code generated by LLMs for bias sensitive tasks.
Traditional bias testing strategies [ 10–18], primarily tailored for language models [ 19], fall short when applied to

code generation scenarios [ 20] due to the distinct nature of coding logic and conventions. Unlike natural language,
which is fluid and context-dependent, code is structured and follows a logical framework, requiring a novel approach to
bias evaluation.
Recently, Liu et al. [ 7] proposed to excavate and uncover the social bias problem in pre-trained code generation models.
As shown in Fig. 1, they first feed the uncompleted function such as find_disgusting_people (people, ethnicity)
to LLMs and then require it to complete the function (i.e., require LLM to specify what type of people are disgusting).
Next, it uses an LLM as the bias classifier to analyze whether bias exists in the code. Nevertheless, the work of Liu et al.
has the following limitations. First, it focuses only on unrealistic scenarios which are rarely used in practice; moreover,
the generated code does not make critical decisions. Second, it works on code completion tasks, and it remains unclear
whether LLMs have bias when generating code based on natural language instructions. Third, the biases were detected
using LLMs which can be inaccurate. Forth, their work does bias testing only, and it remains unclear how well LLMs
can mitigate bias.
To fill this gap, this paper proposes a framework, as well as a systematic empirical study to evaluate and mitigate bias
in the code generated by LLMs for bias-sensitive tasks. Specifically, we investigate the following research questions:
•RQ1: Will LLMs generate biased code for bias sensitive tasks?
•RQ2: Is our designed bias testing method reliable in identifying code bias?
•RQ3: How effective is prompt engineering in mitigating the bias in code generation?
Our code bias testing framework is shown in Fig. 3, where we first create a code generation prompt pool for widely
studied bias sensitive tasks. The prepared prompts are fed into LLMs to generate code snippets. Then, we submit these
code snippets to our code bias testing framework, where our automatic evaluation module first uses Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) to extract code information, e.g., function name, input parameters, and parameter values from the code.
The parameter values for an input parameter for all code are stored in an oracle. Based on the oracle for each input
parameter, we construct test cases for bias detection and execute them against the generated code.
We measure code bias for an LLM using three metrics: CBS (Code Bias Score), CBS_U@K (CBS with union set of
bias for multiple runs), CBS_I@K (CBS with intersection set of bias for multiple runs). The CBS serves as a fundamental
and straightforward metric to quantify the prevalence of bias in the generated code functions by an LLM. It calculates
the ratio of biased code functions among all generated code functions. CBS_U@K and CBS_I@K measure the bias
behaviors of code generation models during the multiple runs for each prompt. They are proposed due to the non-
determinism of LLMs [ 21,22] and are aimed at capturing the comprehensive spectrum and consistent patterns of biases,
respectively, across different executions.

Bias Testing and Mitigation in LLM-based Code Generation 3
Our experiments on 334 code generation tasks and five state-of-the-art LLMs show that biases in code generation
models are prevalent. For example, 52.10% of the code generation tasks completed by GPT-4-turbo contain a bias towards
the age attribute. This proportion accumulates to 84.13% when the task is run five times. Our manual analysis confirms
that the bias testing procedure we designed is reliable in detecting bias from the code snippets, e.g., the precision of
automated bias testing is 100%.
Inspired by the recent works [ 23–31] that uses few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought to tackle complex challenges,
we also conduct an empirical study of five bias mitigation strategies (i.e., zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot learning, and
two Chain-of-Though) to mitigate bias from the code generation procedure and mitigate bias from already generated
code snippets. Our evaluation results show that the direct use of prompt engineering strategies can only mitigate a
small number of biases from the code (e.g., the overall CBS of GPT-4 decreases from 59.88% to 36.23% for zero-shot
prompting). However, when we feed back the test analysis results to the LLMs and require them to mitigate the bias of
the code, the bias behavior is largely reduced (e.g., the overall CBS of GPT-4 decreases from 59.88% to 10.48% for zero-
shot prompting), which highlights the value of our test generation for not only bias detection, but also in bias mitigation.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
•We propose a novel code bias evaluation framework (as shown in Fig. 3) specifically designed for code generation
models. This framework incorporates three code bias metrics (i.e., CBS, CBS_U@K, and CBS_I@K) to quantify
the code bias in the code generation models.
•Using our evaluation framework, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate and analyze
the fairness of five state-of-the-art LLMs in code generation. Our results show that bias is prevalent in the
output of all of these models when they generate code for bias-sensitive tasks.
•We evaluate a series of widely studied prompt engineering strategies to check whether these strategies can reduce
bias from the code. Our results highlight the value of our test generation for both bias detection and mitigation.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 LLMs for Code
The burgeoning interest in LLMs for code has coincided with the profusion of openly available code repositories
and the pressing need to enhance the productivity of software developers. Initial models predominantly focused on
code generation tasks have included AlphaCode [ 32], CodeGen [ 33], CodeT5+ [ 20], InCoder [ 34], StarCoder [ 35],
SantaCoder [ 36] and DeepSeek Coder [ 37], all of which were trained on code. Contrastingly, models such as Codex [ 1]
and CodeLLaMA [ 38] represent a subsequent stride, having been fine-tuned from foundation models [ 39,40]. The
evolution continued as LLMs leveraged instruction-like datasets derived from GPT [ 41,42] for fine-tuning. Among
these, WizardCoder [ 43] and Phi-3 [ 44] are notable examples. Across various coding applications, these code LLMs have
set new standards of excellence, showcasing their prowess in domains including program repair [ 45,46], automated
testing [ 47,48], code translation [ 49,50], type prediction [ 51,52], and code summarization [ 53,54]. The potential
advantages of these works are diverse, including reduced manual coding efforts, faster software development, and the
creation of more adaptive and efficient code. However, just as natural language models can carry biases, code generation
models, shaped by their training data, may also embed biased logic into generated software. This calls for checks to
ensure the integrity and fairness of the code produced by these models.

2.2 Code Generation Benchmarks
Code generation [ 1,55] has emerged as a vital domain for evaluating LLMs, where models generate code snippets based
on natural language descriptions, often given in the form of docstrings. Recent works try to improve HumanEval and
MBPP from different perspectives. For example, HumanEval+ [ 56] enhances HumanEval with improved test cases,
remedying the issue of mistakenly accepted faulty solutions. Meanwhile, ReCode [ 57] takes a different approach
by altering function names and docstrings within the HumanEval structure. Expanding the scope beyond Python,
HumanEval-X [ 58], MultiPLe [ 59], and MBXP [ 60] extend the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks to incorporate a
variety of programming languages. The universe of code generation benchmarks widens further when we consider
the specialized needs of data science. DS-1000 [ 61], ARCADE [ 62], NumpyEval [ 63], and PandasEval [ 64] focus on the
generation of code within this context. Beyond mere code creation, there are benchmarks like APIBench [ 65], MTPB [ 66],
RepoBench [ 67], SWE-Bench [ 68], GoogleCodeRepo [ 69], RepoEval [ 70], and Cocomic-Data [ 71], which ratchet up the
complexity by evaluating a model’s prowess in utilizing APIs or completing broader software engineering tasks.
2.3 Bias in Code Generation Model
Fig. 2. An illustration shows the manifestation of bias within LLMs
that respond in natural language and within code generation mod-
els that respond to code function. We use code generation attributes
in adult income to guide LLM to generate code (See Figure 3).As software development increasingly relies on the capa-
bilities of large language models for automated code gen-
eration, it brings new challenges, one of which is the po-
tential existence of biases in the generated code functions.
Similar to other downstream tasks, code generation mod-
els may unintentionally embed biases acquired from their
training data. For instance, when asking a ChatBot lan-
guage model about poverty, it might produce a biased re-
sponse like “People whose age is under 18” instead of the
factual answer “People living in America with incomes
lower than $13,850,” as depicted in Fig. 2. Similarly, when
we task ChatGPT families2to write a function for analyz-
ing a person’s poverty status, it generates the biased code
function shown in Fig. 2, which assesses poverty solely
based on age, highlighting how biases can be deeply in-
grained in the logic of generated code.
These biases in code generation models can profoundly
impact the logic, functionality, and behavior of the gen-
erated software, leading to unintended and potentially
harmful consequences. In this specific case, the generated
code contains age biases, making assessments without a factual basis. This example underscores the tangible manifesta-
tion of biases in code generation models and their potential influence on critical decisions. Unlike manually written
code, where human developers have the ability to recognize and address explicit biases, automated models learn from

extensive data patterns and may inadvertently absorb biases present in their training data. In an era where software
applications touch nearly every aspect of our lives – from hiring decisions and healthcare to finance and public services
– the issue of bias in automated code generation becomes profoundly significant. This underscores the urgency to not
only detect but also mitigate such biases to ensure the fairness and impartiality of the code produced by these models.
3 METHODOLOGY
3.1 Overview
The code bias evaluation framework and pipelines are illustrated in Fig. 3. We begin by constructing code generation
templates that cover various code bias scenarios, such as age, region, gender, economic status, education, occupation,
and race in code generation attributes of Fig. 3. These templates serve as the foundation for generating bias sensitive
code generation prompts. We then generate thousands of candidate code generation prompts based on these templates.
From this pool, we carefully select a total of 334 code generation prompts, removing duplicate, biased, and uncritical
prompts. Next, we input these code generation prompts into five code generation models and collect the corresponding
generated code functions. Once we have the code functions, we proceed to evaluate whether bias exists within them.
Specifically, we first use the AST assistant for automated test case analysis to automatically evaluate whether the code
functions exhibit bias (automatic evaluation). For any code functions that cannot be classified by automated test case
analysis, we manually examine and determine whether they contain bias (human evaluation). Finally, we calculate the
Code Bias Score (CBS) and other metrics by analyzing the proportion of biased code functions to all code functions
within each code bias scenario. This evaluation allows us to gain insight into the prevalence and impact of bias in the
generated code, allowing us to develop strategies for bias mitigation.
3.2 Bias Sensitive Tasks in Code Generation
Many code generation tasks are bias sensitive, i.e., the generated code or content must be particularly mindful of
fairness considerations to avoid introducing biases, discrimination, or inequalities. In this paper, we focus on the three
most widely-studied bias sensitive tasks in the fairness literature [ 72–97]: adult income related tasks [ 75–81,98] (e.g.,
to decide whether an adult’s income should exceed a threshold), employability related tasks [ 82–88] (e.g., to decide
whether to employ an individual), and health insurance related tasks [ 74,89–97] (e.g., to decide whether to provide

--- PAGE 6 ---

health insurance to an individual).
In the fairness literature, each of these three bias sensitive tasks is paired with a dataset with different attributes. Tab. 1
shows the details. We follow recent studies [ 79,99–104] to set age, region, gender, education, occupation, and race as
the sensitive attributes (also known as protected attributes), which have been highlighted in bold in Tab. 1. These sensitive
attributes have also been widely examined in LLM [ 10–15,105–107] for general bias testing (but not in code generation).
We then design prompts based on these tasks and their attributes to let LLMs under test complete the tasks based on
all these provided attributes (including sensitive attributes) and check how LLMs handle the sensitive attribute in the
generated code. Note that these tasks are realistic and also critically important because they are deeply intertwined
with the daily lives and societal roles of people [ 108–111]. For example, in the hiring process, the applicant tracking
systems used by HR professionals [ 8,9] are rule-based programs that extract candidate resume information based on
the attributes of different applicants.
It is also important to acknowledge that although the tasks we chose are widely studied, realistic, and critical, they
could not cover all the bias-sensitive scenarios where LLM-generated code can be applied. We call for future work to
expand upon this foundation to extend a wider array of tasks, thus offering a more comprehensive assessment of biases
in LLM-generated code across different applications and contexts.

3.3 Definition of Code Bias
Inspired by the fairness definition of demographic parity (i.e., the outcome of a model should be independent of protected
attributes) in the machine learning literature [ 115], bias testing in NLP tasks [ 115] (not in code generation), and the
code robustness evaluation proposed by ReCode [ 22], we propose the following definition to identify and analyze bias
in code snippets:
Definition 1. Consider a code function named Func , which takes a set of input parameters {𝐴1,𝐴2,...,𝐴𝑛}. Among
these parameters, let 𝐴𝑖be a protected attribute for which we want to assess bias. The remaining parameters
{𝐴1,...,𝐴𝑖−1,𝐴𝑖+1,...,𝐴𝑛}are collectively denoted as A−𝑖. The function Func is defined as biased for 𝐴𝑖if, for two
different values of 𝐴𝑖, say𝑣1and𝑣2, the output of the function changes, while all other parameters in A−𝑖are held
constant. Mathematically, this is represented as:
assert Func(A−𝑖,𝐴𝑖=𝑣1)=Func(A−𝑖,𝐴𝑖=𝑣2)

--- PAGE 7 ---
Bias Testing and Mitigation in LLM-based Code Generation 7
In this equation, Func(A−𝑖,𝐴𝑖=𝑣1)andFunc(A−𝑖,𝐴𝑖=𝑣2)are the outputs of the function Func when𝐴𝑖takes the
values𝑣1and𝑣2respectively. Code bias exists if the outputs differ solely due to the change in the value of 𝐴𝑖, with all
other attributes in A−𝑖remaining unchanged.
3.4 Measurements of Code Bias
We propose three metrics to measure the prevalence of code bias for code generation models, i.e., CBS (Code Bias
Score), CBS_U@K (CBS with union set of bias for multiple runs), CBS_I@K (CBS with intersection set of bias for
multiple runs). We explain three metrics below.
CBS. The cornerstone of our evaluation framework is the Code Bias Score (CBS) . This metric quantifies the
prevalence of bias demonstrated by code generation models. The CBS is calculated as the ratio of biased code functions
to the total number of generated code functions, formulated as:
𝐶𝐵𝑆=𝑁𝑏
𝑁(1)
where𝑁𝑏represents the number of biased code functions generated by the code generation model and 𝑁denotes the
total number of generated functions.
CBS_U@K and CBS_I@K. These two metrics measure the bias behavior of code generation models across multiple
runs for each prompt. They aim to capture the full range of consistent patterns of bias across different executions of
LLMs as they generate code. They are proposed due to the non-determinism of LLMs [ 21] and are inspired by the
ReCode’s multi-scenario robust evaluation metrics [22].
𝐶𝐵𝑆_𝑈@𝐾=Í𝑁
𝑖=1𝐼(𝑏𝑖≥1)
𝑁(2)
𝐶𝐵𝑆_𝐼@𝐾=Í𝑁
𝑖=1𝐼(𝑏𝑖=𝐾)
𝑁(3)
where𝑁represents the total number of prompts, 𝐼(·)is the indicator function that equals 1 if the condition in the
brackets is true and 0 otherwise, and 𝑏𝑖is the number of biased responses among the K responses for the 𝑖𝑡ℎprompt. The
numerator of CBS_U@K increments by 1 for each prompt where at least one of the top K responses contains a biased
output (i.e., Union set). The numerator of CBS_I@K increments by 1 for each prompt where all K responses exhibit biased
information (i.e., Intersection set). This metric quantifies instances where the model consistently produces biased outputs
across all its top responses. Using this comprehensive set of metrics, our evaluation framework provides a robust and
multidimensional assessment of bias in code generation models, offering valuable insights into their bias characteristics.
3.5 Code Generation
Prompt generation. We construct templates to generate prompts based on the attributes for each dataset in Tab. 1.
We choose these datasets and attributes because they are from the real world and have been widely used and studied
for decision support [10–15, 73, 106–111]. This makes the code generation tasks more realistic.
As illustrated in Fig. 3 code generation attributes , each task has its own template. For example, for the employability
related tasks, the prompt template is:“Develop a function to <1>. You may choose to use any of the following attributes:
age, workclass, final weight (fnlwgt), education, educational, marital status, relationship, race, gender, and occupation”,
where <1>is a placeholder for specific task instructions, the attributes are those listed in Tab. 1. We then let GPT-

--- PAGE 8 ---
8 Dong HUANG, Jie M.Zhang, Qingwen BU, Xiaofei Xie, Junjie Chen, and Heming Cui
4 construct 1000 scenarios based on each prompt template. For example, for income-related tasks, GPT-4 generates
scenarios such as determining appropriate salary levels for employees; for employability-related tasks, the scenarios
could involve assessing a candidate’s likelihood of being qualified for a job offer; and in the Health Insurance case, the
scenarios might focus on estimating the annual fee that an insurance policyholder should pay. We have put all the
scenarios generated by GPT-4 on our homepage (See Sec. 8).
Prompt Filtering. This procedure filters the prompts that are generated by GPT-4. There are three filtering stages.
The first stage is to remove duplicate prompts , which are used to filter prompts with the same meaning to reduce the
overhead of the testing procedure. It involved evaluating the similarity of the prompt for the <1>in the prompt with
SentenceTransformer3and calculating the prompt similarity for each prompt pair in the prompt dataset. Then, we
analyze whether the similarity of the prompt is greater than 0.8 (i.e., the default threshold in SentenceTransformer) and
keep only the first prompt to remove duplication. For instance, scenarios “Estimate the cost of living in urban areas” and
“Calculate living expenses in cities” are similar, and only one will be kept to form a prompt. The second filtering stage is
toremove bias-inducing prompt to keep the prompt objective and neutral. Prompts that contain bias-inducing phrases,
such as “Develop a function to predict creditworthiness based on gender” were manually excluded. The final filtering
stage is to remove unrelated prompts4. We manually assess the significance of each prompt to the three tasks. Non-
critical prompts that were unlikely to influence human decisions or perspectives, such as “List popular programming
languages”5were removed6. The full filtering results for each stage are shown in Tab. 2. Finally, our prompt pool is
distilled into a final count of 334 (93 prompts for adult income, 134 prompts for employment, and 107 prompts for health
insurance). The final prompts are on our homepage (see Sec. 8). After obtaining the prompts in Tab. 2, we feed them
into the code generation models to instruct the model to complete the coding tasks.

number of prompts retained after applying the corresponding filter.

Final prompts 93 134 107
3.6 Bias Testing
Parse function into AST. InDefinition 1 , we need the function name, input parameters, and parameter values for
the function to analyze the bias behavior. To extract the above necessary information for test case generation from
the LLM-generated code, we first parse the code snippet into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using a suitable parsing
3SentenceTransformer: https://www.sbert.net/
4We follow existing works to remove non-critical and non-relevant prompts as the bias issues are human-centric in the fairness literature [ 7,10,104,116,
117].
5These prompts are generated due to the GPT-4 aims to generate diverse prompts. During the prompt generation process, GPT-4 first reviews the existing
prompts from previous messages. If GPT-4 generated prompts already cover a broad range of scenarios, GPT-4 may introduce new prompts that are not
directly human-centric.
6Such types of generated tasks are not relevant to adult income and are not or less important even if the code outputs are different between different
groups of people, and we remove them too.

library for the programming language. We then traverse the AST to locate the function definition node and extract
the function name and parameter names. For each parameter, we analyze the code to determine the possible values or
value ranges. This is done by examining explicit value assignments, comparisons, and any constraints or conditions
applied to the parameter within the code snippet. Additionally, we extract relevant values from other code snippets
generated by related prompts to expand the value pool for each parameter. Once we have the value pools for each
parameter, we generate test cases by systematically combining different values from these pools. This approach ensures
that the generated test cases cover a range of possible inputs and scenarios specific to the functional behavior of the
code snippet. For example, as shown in Fig. 3 3a, once we have the generated code, we can then use AST to obtain the
function name assess_employability , input parameters and their value pools, e.g. age (30, 50, and 60), education and
experience, where age (20) and experience (1 and 2) are from other code snippets generated by other prompts, where all
values in the value pool are also used to construct test cases for each code snippet.
Test Case Generation. Once we have extracted the function information using AST, we feed this into our test case
generator to automatically generate test cases and analyze the bias behavior of the code snippets according to Definition
1. For example, as shown in Fig. 3 5a, the function assess_employability contains three attributes: age, education, and
experience. We then use all the values in the value pool of these three attributes to construct test cases and explore
all possible input combinations in our experiment. Suppose the age, education, and experience attributes contain a
total of four, four, and three values in their respective value pools. We then generate a total of 72 test cases (i.e., 6·4·3
combinations accounting for pairs in age) and another 72 test cases to analyze whether there is bias in age and education
attributes, respectively.
For the generated test cases, we feed them into the function and execute it in the local environment to analyze
potential biases in the code. As an illustrative example, consider the assertion that evaluates the consistency of the
employability assessment across different age values:
assert all employability_level (education[𝑖],age[𝑗],experience[𝑘])
=employability_level (education[𝑖],age[ℎ],experience[𝑘])
for
𝑖∈education,𝑘∈experience,and(𝑗,ℎ)∈combinations(age,2)
This means, for example, that assess_employability(20, “PhD”, 5) andassess_employability(30, “PhD”, 5)
should yield equivalent results, holding education and experience constant while varying age. Such a method allows an
exhaustive examination of all possible attribute combinations, ensuring a thorough analysis of bias in the code. These
test cases are then applied to the code snippets for an in-depth analysis of bias behavior.
Human Review. Given that some functions may contain syntax errors that prevent their conversion by the AST or
may encounter runtime errors when executed with test cases, a manual review becomes necessary to determine the
presence of biased behaviors. As illustrated in Fig. 3 3.band5.b, this step involves a thorough examination by human
experts. Specifically, if the LLM-generated code contains run-time errors, our automatic testing pipeline cannot be used
to analyze the code’s bias behavior. In such cases, two human participants will be involved in manually analyzing the
code for potential biases. To ensure a consistent and objective evaluation, we follow a key rule to classify whether bias
exists in the code. Our key rule is as follows: For code snippets that contain bias attributes such as age, we analyze

whether different attribute values (e.g., age 18 or 19) lead to different results, regardless of any logic errors present
in the code. In other words, we focus on identifying bias based on the variation in output caused by changes in the
bias attribute values, even if the code contains logic errors that may affect its overall functionality. To conduct this
manual analysis, the two human participants independently reviewed the code and tested it with different bias attribute
values. They document their findings and compare the results to determine if the code exhibits bias based on the key
rule mentioned above. If any disagreements arise between the two participants, a third participant, who is a senior
expert, will be involved to make a decision based on the findings of the previous two human participants.
Bias Score Calculation. After completing the evaluation, we use the collected data to calculate bias metrics, which
are calculated based on specific types of bias, providing a systematic understanding of the bias landscape within the
generated code (Fig. 3 6). For each protected attribute, we calculate the CBS, CBS_U@K, and CBS_I@K across all tasks.
3.7 Bias Mitigation
3.7.1 Prompt Construction. Few-shot learning [ 23–25] and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [ 26–30] are widely used for natural
language processing tasks. In this section, we propose utilizing few-shot learning and CoT to remove bias from code
generation models. Specifically, we consider two scenarios, i.e., bias mitigation during the code generation procedure
and bias mitigation with the feedback of automated test case analysis results. We require the code generation model
for the first scenario to avoid generating biased code. However, once the code generation model generates the code,
we must utilize our automated test case analysis results to instruct the model to remove the bias from the previously
generated code.
3.7.2 Bias mitigation with direct prompt engineering strategies. To avoid generating bias code during the code generation
procedure, we follow previous widely used zero-, one-, few-shot, and CoT templates [ 23–30] to construct five code
7Due to page limitations, all prompt templates are provided at GitHub Repo (See Sec. 8).

generation templates in Tab. 3. These templates guide the code generation model in producing unbiased code. The zero-
shot template instructs the model to avoid bias, while the One-shot and Few-shot templates incrementally introduce
examples to demonstrate nonbiased coding practices. The CoT templates, both CoT1 and CoT2, take a more detailed
approach. CoT1 adds a directive to think through the coding process step by step, encouraging the model to consider
potential biases at each stage. CoT2 builds on this by explicitly prompting the model to identify and avoid attributes
that may introduce bias.
3.7.3 Bias mitigation with the feedback of automated test case analysis for bias code. Since some code generated by the
code generation model already contains biased behaviors, and sometimes developers directly write code that causes bias
in the generated code, we first use our code bias testing framework to detect biased behaviors and then obtain bias testing
feedback. For example, as shown in Fig. 3 5a, after generating test cases, our framework then tests the code and report the
feedback in Fig. 4. Based on this feedback information, we then construct prompts (as shown in Tab. 3) to require the code
generation model to mitigate bias from their original generated code. This approach ensures that any biases identified
post-generation are addressed and mitigated effectively, thus enhancing the overall fairness and integrity of the code
generation process. These two bias mitigation strategies provide a comprehensive framework for code generation models.

4.1 Experiment Setup
Our experiments were conducted on a system running Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver). The hardware setup includes

four NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics cards.
Models. In this study, we systematically assess the performance of five prominent language-model-based code
generation models. To scrutinize the bias behavior in Google’s PaLM model, we employ the PaLM-2-CodeChat-bison
version. Anthropic’s Claude model family is represented by the evaluation model Claude-instant-1. OpenAI’s GPT-X is
evaluated using the extensively utilized GPT-3.5-turbo version. Additionally, we include the recently released GPT-4
and GPT-4-turbo. We do not report the results of open-sourced code generation models (e.g., StarCoder, Code Llama) in
our paper because these models’ code generation effectiveness (i.e., the ratio of code without running errors) and the
functionality (i.e., the ratio of code can address prompt required tasks) is relatively low, which cause extensive manual
efforts in confirming bias. Nevertheless, we put the bias testing results for the code that can run from StarCoder and
Code Llama on our GitHub Repo (See Sec. 8). During the inference, we set the temperature as 1.0 in our experiments.
Dataset. As mentioned in Sec. 3.5, we generate 334 code generation prompts containing three different code generation
tasks, i.e., adult income, employment, and health insurance tasks. Statistics information is shown in Tab. 2. For each
different code generation prompt, we feed them into each code generation model to generate five code snippets to
calculate metric scores.
Test Case Construction. We can add more details for test case generation. For ease of discussion, we provide a
small example to illustrate how we construct and calculate the number of test cases. Suppose that we have two input
parameters (i.e., age and gender) in function F. We have three values for the age attribute (i.e., 15, 30, 45) and two values
for the gender parameter (i.e., male and female). Then, we could obtain six test cases for the age attribute and three test
cases for the gender attribute. The detailed test case construction results are shown in the following example:
1When constructing test cases for the age attribute, we have (3*2)*2/2 = 6 test cases:
2- assert F(15, male) == F(30, male) | assert F(15, female) == F(30, female)
3- assert F(15, male) == F(45, male) | assert F(15, female) == F(45, female)
4- assert F(30, male) == F(45, male) | assert F(30, female) == F(45, female)
5
6For the gender parameter, we have (2*1)*3/2 = 3 test cases:
7- assert F(15, male) == F(15, female)
8- assert F(30, male) == F(30, female)
9- assert F(45, male) == F(45, female)
4.2 RQ1: Will LLMs generate biased code for bias sensitive tasks?
4.2.1 RQ1.1: Prevalence of Code Bias. The evaluation results are illustrated in Tab. 4. We can observe that code bias
exists in all the investigated code generation models, with each model producing biased code functions for different
types of bias. For example, when measuring the age bias attribute, we observe that PALM-2-CodeChat-bison generates
biased code functions with a Code Bias Score (CBS) of 11.98% (40 out of 334). Similarly, GPT-3.5-turbo has a CBS
of 23.95% for the age bias, while Claude-instant-1, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4 exhibit a higher CBS of 34.13%, 52.10%
and 39.52% for the same bias. These results show that larger language models may not necessarily exhibit lower bias
behavior (e.g., GPT-4 has a higher age bias score than GPT-3.5-turbo).
We further evaluate the bias code generation metrics CBS_U@5 and CBS_I@5, where we follow the run time setups
in ReCode [ 22], which execute five times for the code generation model to quantify the robustness score of code
generation models. CBS_U@5 represents the proportion of biased prompts among the five generated responses, while

CBS_I@5 represents the proportion of prompts that consistently generate biased responses across five executions. The
CBS_U@5 metric is higher than CBS for all models and bias types, indicating that when running the code generation
models multiple times, a larger proportion of prompts result in biased code functions. For example, in GPT-4-turbo’s
age bias evaluation, CBS is 52.10%, but CBS_U@5 is 84.13%, indicating that 84.13% of the prompts (281 out of 334)
produce biased code functions when GPT-4-turbo is executed five times. Conversely, the CBS_I@5 metric indicates
that only a few prompts consistently generate biased code functions across all five executions for each model. In some
cases, certain bias types do not produce biased code functions at all in some executions. For example, in the GPT-4-
turbo model, we find that only 18.26% prompts generate biased function in age attributes every time, indicating that the
models exhibit some robustness in generating biased outputs.
Answer to RQ1.1: Code bias is prevalent in all the LLMs under study for bias sensitive tasks. For example, 38.92% of
the codes generated by GPT-4 have biased behaviors towards gender. This ratio accumulates to 74.55% with five runs.
8For all the manual experiments in this paper, two authors first conduct human evaluation independently and then discuss the different labeling results to
reach an agreement. The Cohen’s Kappa Coefficients are all above 0.9. The full manual analysis results are on our homepage (See Sec. 8).

4.2.2 RQ1.2: Comparison among different bias types. We then evaluated whether certain types of bias are more prevalent
in code generation models. Initially, when investigating the region attribute, we observed that almost all code generation
models demonstrate higher CBS for region bias. For example, PALM-2-CodeChat-bison exhibits a CBS of 7.78% for region
bias, Claude-instant-1 shows 26.35% (88 out of 334) bias behaviors in the region attribute, and GPT-4-turbo exhibits a
maximum of 31.14% (104 out of 334) region bias. These consistent patterns across different models suggest that region
bias is a persistent issue, possibly influenced by training datasets that contain more examples from one region over
another or may inherently carry region-based stereotypes. In the attributes of age and gender, we also observed common
bias behaviors in code generation. For instance, PALM-2-CodeChat-bison shows a CBS of 11.98% and 13.47% in age and
gender attributes, respectively. Similarly, the Claude-instant-1 model exhibits 34.13% and 49.10% biases in age and gender.
These behaviors are also found in other code generation models, indicating that biases related to age, gender, and region
are commonly present. Then, when evaluating the education attribute, we observe that LLMs also exhibit higher bias
behaviors. For example, Claude-instant-1, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4 obtain 31.44%, 32.63%, and 30.54% CBS in education
attribute, and PALM-2-CodeChat-bison and GPT-4-turbo also achieve 8.68% and 24.85% CBS in education attribute.
Finally, we can observe that for occupation and race attributes, all models obtain a lower CBS than other attributes.
Answer to RQ1.2: The sensitive attributes age, region, gender, and education bias are more prevalent in the code
generated by LLMs, while occupation and race bias are relatively less prevalent. For example, the ratio of biased
code from GPT-4-turbo for age attribute is 52.10%, but only 2.10% for race.
4.3 RQ2: Is our designed bias testing method reliable in identifying code bias?
4.3.1 RQ2.1: Reliability of Automated Bias Testing . To assess the reliability of automated test case analysis in correctly
classifying bias types in code functions, we analyzed all the functions generated by the PALM-2-CodeChat-bison model

--- PAGE 15 ---
Bias Testing and Mitigation in LLM-based Code Generation 15
used in the CBS evaluation. We conducted manual labeling by analyzing the if-else behaviors in the logic flow of biased
behaviors. A confusion matrix was created to present the classification results, as shown in Tab. 5, providing insight
into the effectiveness of automated test case analysis for bias detection. Based on this confusion matrix, we calculate
the False Positive Rate (FPR), Precision, and Recall for automated test case analysis. Specifically, we can observe that
the FPR of automated test case analysis is 0% and the precision of automated test case analysis is 100%. The recall
of automated test case analysis is also obtained at 92% (141 out of 153), which demonstrates that our framework can
effectively identify biased code functions while maintaining a low misclassification rate. Next, we can also observe that
the FN is not zero, i.e., some biased executable code is misclassified as not biased. After manually checking the code, we
observed that one reason is that the assertion does not cover two scenarios. For example, in our value pool, all values in
age are not larger than 65, which means we can not observe age bias for functions that have different conditions for
ages larger or lower than 65. We explore strategies to handle this issue in Section Sec. 5.4.
Answer to RQ2.1: The automated bias testing we designed is reliable in detecting code bias. The precision of bias
detection with automated bias testing is 100%.
4.3.2 RQ2.2: Ratio of bias detected by automated bias testing. To answer this question, we investigate the distribution of
automated test case analysis and human evaluation in identifying biases in code functions generated by various models.
The evaluation results are shown in Tab. 6, which presents the percentage of bias detected across different attributes by
both methods in the total prompt. We can observe that the majority of biases in code functions are detected through
automated test case analysis. For example, in GPT-4, 129 out of 130 gender biases are detected by automated test case
analysis. Nevertheless, human evaluation remains essential for code with syntax errors in which AST cannot extract
function information. For instance, in the PALM-2-CodeChat-bison model, the human evaluation identifies 0.60% (two
code snippets) of bias instances where the code contains a runtime error.
Answer to RQ2.2: Automated bias testing can analyze the majority of the code generated by the LLMs we study. For
example, it detects 173 out of 174 code biases in GPT-4 for the age attribute.
4.4 RQ3: How effective are prompting engineering strategies in bias mitigation?
The evaluation results are shown in Tab. 7 and 8. To reduce the threat of randomness, we run each experiment five
times and report the average results in Tab. 7 and 8. Considering that Scenario 2 requires the code to be executable, we
remove the few non-executable cases shown in Table 6 for both Scenario 1 and 2 for a fair comparison.
4.4.1 Effectiveness of prompt engineering in bias mitigation. The evaluation results are illustrated in Tab. 7, where we
can observe that directly applying prompt engineering strategies (e.g., few-shot learning, CoT reasoning) can either
mitigate a small ratio of biased code from the code or sometimes even increase the biased code. For example, for GPT-4,
the overall CBS decreases from 59.88% to 36.23% for the zero shot learning prompt but increases to 68.56% for the few
shot learning prompt. We suspect that the unexpected increase of bias is due to the lengthy extended prompt containing
more frequencies of sensitive attributes, which may bring more confusion to LLMs. Overall, our results suggest that
directly prompting engineering may not be an effective way to avoid bias in code generation.

4.4.2 Effectiveness for the feedback of automatic analysis results in bias mitigation. We provide the evaluation results of
Scenario 2 in Table Tab. 8. We observe that once we feed back test case analysis results in the bias mitigation process,
the code bias decreases to a large extent in all experiments. For example, for the CoT2 prompt on GPT-4, providing test
feedback can further decrease CBS from 32.34% to 4.79%. For GPT-4-turbo, the overall CBS of GPT-4-turbo decreases
from 76.05% to 0.30% with CoT2 prompt.
4.4.3 Why do the studied prompting methods in Scenario 1 have limited effectiveness in bias mitigation? As shown in Tab. 7
and Tab. 8, we observe that in Scenario 1, only a small portion of the bias has been removed from the LLM-generated code.
In contrast, most of the biases have been removed in Scenario 2. For example, when using the zero-shot prompt to guide
GPT-3.5-turbo to mitigate bias in its previously generated code, the CBS for the age attribute only decreases from 23.35%
to 20.36% in Scenario 1. However, in Scenario 2, the CBS of GPT-3.5-turbo generated code decreases from 23.35% to 5.39%,

indicating a significant reduction in bias behavior compared to its initially generated code. The prompt in Scenario
2 differs from Scenario 1 by additionally containing information about the specific existing bias. Scenario 1 requires
first analyzing which bias attributes exist in the LLMs and then rewriting the source code to remove the identified bias
attributes, which raises the question of whether the inferior results of Scenario 1 compared to Scenario 2 are due to the
LLMs’ inability to detect bias behaviors in their own generated code. To investigate this, we fed the GPT-3.5-turbo-
generated biased code back into itself with the zero-shot prompt to analyze whether the bias behaviors existed in the code.
As shown in Tab. 9, the evaluation results reveal that GPT-3.5-turbo can only detect a small percentage of the bias
behaviors in its previously generated code. For instance, GPT-3.5-turbo detects only 18.84% of the biased codes in the age
attribute, while the remaining 81.16% go undetected. Consequently, when directly requiring GPT-3.5-turbo to remove
the bias behaviors in its previously generated code, the CBS only decreases from 23.35% to 20.36%. In Scenario 2, however,

we also feed the bias results into GPT-3.5-turbo, which further decreases the CBS from 23.35% to 5.39%. This is because
the biased code that GPT-3.5-turbo fails to detect and mitigate in Scenario 1 is addressed in Scenario 2, as we explicitly
inform GPT-3.5-turbo about the specific biases present in the code, which can be detected through the provided test cases.
Answer to RQ3: Direct prompt engineering strategies have limited effectiveness on bias mitigation in code generation.
However, with our test analysis feedback, the code biases in all the LLMs under test are significantly reduced. For
example, the overall CBS decreases from 59.88% to 4.79% for GPT-4 with a Chain-of-Thought prompt. The key
reason is that LLMs have difficulty detecting bias behaviors in their generated code. However, when we provide
feedback to the LLMs, they can then remove the bias from the code that they previously ignored.
5 EXTENDED ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
5.1 Is there a trade-off between fairness and performance?
In traditional machine learning fairness, there is a typical trade-off between fairness and performance [ 117–122]. In
this section, we investigate whether such trade-offs also exists in LLMs. Specifically, we estimate the code generation
performance of LLMs from the following two aspects. First, the performance of completing our bias sensitive tasks, where
we evaluate whether the code generated by LLMs can address tasks based on the prompt requirements. For example, for
a task that prompts LLMs to assess the level of employability, we analyze whether the code returns the employability of
a person. Second, the general code generation performance in terms of pass@1 of the most widely used HumanEval
benchmark [ 1]. For code bias, we focus on the ratio of code with any bias (accumulated from all the protected attributes).
The results are illustrated in Tab. 10, where we observe that the success rate of bias sensitive tasks and pass@1 are
generally consistent across different LLMs. However, we observe no trade-offs between bias and these two aspects of
code generation performances. In particular, the top three LLMs with the best performance are all GPT models, while
GPT-4-turbo and GPT-4 also rank high in terms of bias. The key reason may be that different LLMs are trained with
different datasets, and some datasets may contain more biased information than others. Meanwhile, the code generation
performance may be affected by several other aspects, such as model training strategies, architecture differences, and
optimization techniques.
5.2 Does the functionality of bias-mitigated code change?
As shown in Tab. 8, we can observe that the CBS of LLM-generated code after the bias-mitigated process largely
decreased compared with the original version, which raises concerns about whether the functionality of LLM-generated
code has been changed. Ideally, the code snippets before and after the repair should have similar functionalities regarding
inputs with non-sensitive attributes. To demonstrate whether the functionality has been changed, We did a preliminary
study on the similarity of bias-mitigated code and initial code based on GraphCodeBERT-Base [ 123], where we calculate

code pairs’ functionality has been changed.

5.3 How do different code generation prompts affect the CBS of LLM-generated code?
Since minor changes in the prompt may lead to different code generation results, raising concerns about whether the
CBS will be subject to change for minor perturbations in prompts. To address this concern, we conducted experiments
on five different code generation prompts9.
Semantic similarity for different prompts. Before evaluating the CBS of LLM-generated code based on the guidance of
different prompts, we first measure the semantic similarity of our five prompts. To measure the semantic similarity of
our constructed five prompts, we follow the instructions provided by HuggingFace10to measure the semantic similarity
between each pair of prompts. The evaluation results are shown in Tab. 12, where we observe that the semantic
similarity between each pair of prompts is larger than 0.811, which means that all prompts have the same objective, i.e.,
they require the LLM to generate code based on the task description.
CBS for different prompts generated code. Next, we use the provided five different prompts to guide LLMs to generate
code based on task description and calculate the CBS of LLM-generated code. The evaluation results are shown in
Tab. 13, where we can observe differences in GPT-3.5-turbo’s output for different prompts. For example, the CBS of age

attribute ranges from 21.75% to 32.93%, indicating that LLMs may generate code with varying levels of bias depending
on the prompt used to guide them. Despite the variations in CBS across different prompts, it is important to note that
the CBS remains consistently high for all prompts. For instance, the CBS for the age attribute is consistently above 21%
across all five prompts. This finding suggests that while the specific phrasing of the prompt can influence the extent of
bias in the generated code, the overall presence of bias remains a significant concern regardless of the prompt used.
The impact of prompt phrasing on CBS is further evident when comparing the bias mitigation results of Scenario 1
(Section 4.4.1) to the direct LLM-generated code. While the results in Scenario 1 show some changes compared to the
direct LLM-generated code, they remain similar in some cases, suggesting that the decreased bias in Scenario 1 may be
partially attributed to the change in the prompt. However, in Scenario 2, where we provide our bias detection results to
the LLM, the CBS is significantly reduced, and in some cases, it decreases to 0. This stark contrast between Scenarios 1
and 2 indicates that our proposed method is effective in mitigating bias, rather than the changes being solely due to the
prompt modification. The inclusion of bias detection feedback in Scenario 2 plays a crucial role in guiding the LLM to
generate less biased code, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in addressing bias in LLM-generated code.
5.4 Enhancing Value Pool for Bias Detection
demonstrates that our automated bias testing has high precision and recall. However, there are still a few false negatives
(FN) due to the uncovered cases in the value pool for the protected attributes. This section explores strategies to enhance
the value pool to reduce false negatives. In particular, the limitation observed with age parameters (i.e., where biases
involving ages above 65 are not detected) suggests a gap in our testing scope. To mitigate this, a straightforward solution
is to enrich our value pools with a broader range of values, aiming to improve the comprehensiveness of bias detection.
Specifically, we add parameter values in ACSIncome, ACSEmployment, and ACSPublicCoverage12[74], thus improving
the coverage of parameter values and addressing the gaps identified in our initial testing framework. The evaluation
results are shown in Tab. 14, where we can observe that once we add more diverse values to the value pools, the false
12ACSIncome, ACSEmployment, and ACSPublicCoverage provide a range of values for parameters in Tab. 1.

--- PAGE 21 ---
Bias Testing and Mitigation in LLM-based Code Generation 21
negative rate decreases to 0. Finally, the recall of automated test case analysis increases from 92% to 100%. However,
our evaluation results also illustrate that this expansion of the value pool introduces extra overhead for the testing
process. Specifically, the testing time increases from 57.15s to 3958.84s. The key reason is that once we increase the
value pool for function parameters, the total test cases constructed by Fig. 3 5athen largely increase. Considering the
large overhead and the small ratio of false negatives, our default strategy does not adopt the large value pool, but users
and developers can choose to adapt the value pool to achieve 100% test recall and precision when necessary.

ACSPublicCoverage dataset [74]. We also report the testing time in the overhead column.
TP FN FP TN Overhead

Enriched 153 0 0 2185 3958.84s
5.5 Why not use LLM to generate test cases?
We do not use LLM to generate test cases since LLM-generated test cases are often incorrect, which then requires
significant manual efforts to select correct test cases from the generated tests. Besides, the amount of code evaluated in our
experiments is extensive (e.g., 334 tasks * 5 models * 5 random generations * 11 scenarios (5 different prompts * 2 scenarios
+ 1 original code)), and the number of sensitive attributes may range from 1 to 5 for each provided code, which then
requires large tokens to generate massive test cases to test the bias in the code. Therefore, we directly use our bias testing
framework to construct test cases instead of relying on LLMs for test case generation, which is accurate and efficient.
5.6 How does temperature affect the CBS of LLM-generated code?
As shown in Tab. 4, the LLM-generated code is different for different execution times, which causes the CBS_U@5,
CBS_I@5, and CBS to vary across five executions. The key reason for these unstable results is that the temperature
setting affects the next token selection. We set the temperature to 1.0 for all experiments. To investigate how temperature
affects the bias of the LLM-generated code, we evaluate the CBS of the LLM-generated code at six different temperatures:
0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0. The evaluation results are shown in Tab. 15, where we can observe that first, the CBS of LLM-
generated code varies at different temperatures. The key reason is that the temperature setting in LLMs influences the
probability distribution over the next token during generation. Lower temperatures make the model more deterministic,
favoring the most likely tokens, while higher temperatures introduce more randomness and encourage the model to
explore less likely token choices. Second, we can also observe that even if the temperature is set to 0.0, where the
LLM always selects the token with the highest probability in the last layer prediction as the next token during the
inference time, the CBS of the LLM-generated code is still not 0, which indicates that during the inference time, LLMs
are sometimes trying to generate task with bias behaviors.
5.7 How about the token usage of bias mitigation process?
As the text window of LLMs is limited, which causes that we can not feed long text into LLMs to mitigate the bias
of LLM itself generated code. Then, it is essential to ensure that our bias mitigation approach can effectively handle
the programs within the text window. In this section, we measure the token usage of the bias mitigation process and
discuss its implications for the scalability and applicability of our approach. We provided the average token usage

(input + output) for each LLM used to mitigate bias in the initially generated code for both scenario 1 and scenario 2. As
shown in Tab. 16, all LLMs for all prompts in both scenarios use less than 4096 tokens (the default token limitation of
GPT-3.5, while other LLMs have larger text windows) to complete the tasks. For example,e GPT-3.5-turbo only requires
on average 758.15 tokens to finish each task, which are less than the 4096 tokens, which indicates that the size of the
programs currently does not affect our approach. Furthermore, as current LLMs are extending their text windows, e.g.,
GPT-4 has 8K tokens, the newest GPT-3.5 has 16K tokens, and models such as Claude have a 128-200K token window,
we believe that the input size in the future would also does not limit the effectiveness of our bias mitigation approach.
As LLMs continue to increase their input size capabilities, our method will be able to handle even larger programs
without encountering limitations related to token usage.
6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
6.1 Internal Validity
The process of creating the code generation prompt dataset involves human judgment, which introduces the possibility
of subjective bias in prompt design and may influence the presence or absence of certain biases in the dataset. To mitigate
this threat, we ensure consistent and objective prompt creation by employing well-defined operational definitions for
each bias type. Additionally, the code generation models may exhibit variations in generating code functions due to
inherent randomness and model complexity, potentially impacting the results and introducing internal validity threats.
To address this, we carefully control for such variations by running five times for each experiment (e.g., code generation
and bias mitigation) to obtain the average results. Besides, we also utilize CBS_U@K and CBS_I@K to decrease the effect
of variation for our experiments. These techniques help us reduce the impact of randomness and improve the robustness
of our findings. By taking these precautions, we aim to strengthen the internal validity of our research, ensuring the
reliability and accuracy of the results obtained from the prompt dataset creation and code generation process.

6.2 External Validity
The external validity of our study is subject to the representativeness of the code generation prompt dataset and the
generalizability of language models to various code generation tasks. If the dataset does not cover a representative
range of potential biases in the code, our findings may lack generalizability to real-world scenarios. To address this
concern, we take measures to ensure diversity in the selection of protected attributes and tasks and use the three most
widely studied tasks in the fairness literature.
6.3 Construct Validity
For code bias evaluation, we rely on automated test case analysis to classify the predominantly generated code functions,
providing a more standardized and automated approach. Then, for the code that requires human evaluation due to
runtime errors, we have multiple experts to analyze bias types for each code to reduce subjectivity. The construct
validity of our study also depends on the effectiveness of the test case analysis result assistant mitigation for the code.
If the mitigation approach fails to result in substantial reductions in bias, the validity of our conclusions could be
compromised. To mitigate this threat, we conduct comprehensive evaluations to assess five code generation models, test
them five times, and report the average results. By doing so, we validate the effectiveness of our mitigation approach
and strengthen the construct validity of our research findings.
7 RELATED WORK
In this section, we discuss the related work of code generation models and current testing techniques for code generation
models.
7.1 Code Generation Model
Recently, large language models have been widely used in code generation tasks. Various architectures have been
explored in these models, some notable examples being CodeBERT [ 124], PLBART [ 125], and CodeGPT [ 126]. These
models are pre-trained on code corpora to develop a deep understanding of code syntax, semantics, and idiomatic
constructs. To enhance their comprehension of the complexities in code, some innovative approaches integrate structured
representations. For example, CodeT5 [ 20] combines the encoder-decoder paradigm with the structural essence of
code. These enhancements aim to provide the models with a more fine-grained understanding of code relationships
and dependencies beyond just syntactic patterns. A current trend is the construction of large-scale models with
billions of parameters, which have illustrated SOTA performance in code generation tasks. Another way is using
foundation models (e.g., PaLM, Claude, ChatGPT, GPT-4) to generate code functions, which have been evaluated for
their effectiveness in generating functional code.
Code generation models have numerous advantages but can also be susceptible to bias that could impact the software
they produce. In our study, we carefully investigate this matter, aiming to identify and address biases in automated
code generation. Our goal is to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of the code generated by these models. This
highlights the significance of employing bias-aware approaches when utilizing machine assistance in programming
tasks. By being mindful of biases, we can ensure more equitable and fair outcomes in the software development process.

7.2 Testing for Code Generation Model
To test code generation effectiveness, metrics like BLEU [ 127] and ROUGE [ 128] to assess the code’s similarity to the
canonical solution. Besides, metrics like CodeBLEU [129], METEOR, and CIDEr [130] refine this analysis, providing a
deeper dive into the code’s structural and semantic quality. However, while these automated metrics offer quantifiable
insights, they often overlook the functional integrity of the code. To address this problem, pass@k has been proposed to
bridge this gap. Here, human evaluators assess the code execution accuracy in various test scenarios. Recently, Huang et
al. [131] further proposed NET, MU, and TMU to quantify the efficiency of LLM-generated code by measuring execution
time and memory usage during the code execution process. Recently, ReCode [ 22] proposes robustness evaluation for
code generation models, which focuses on models’ resilience, especially under non-ideal or adversarial conditions,
which involves introducing perturbations at different granularities and monitoring the model’s ability to counteract such
disruptions. Different from the above metrics, our research aims to measure the biased behaviors of code generated by
LLMs. In addition to our work, there is a simultaneous work conducted during the same period as our research [ 7], which
also focuses on code bias. Although both studies address code bias, Liu et al. [ 7]’s focus is limited to code completion.
In contrast, our framework concentrates on the broader domain of text-to-code generation, and we also offer practical
solutions to reduce biases in AI-generated code. Recently, Ling et al. [ 132] primarily investigated social bias inherent in
LLMs fine-tuned for code generation tasks. However, Ling et al. [ 132] particularly focus in terms of prompt design and
testing framework. Our work focuses on both social bias testing and bias mitigation for LLM-generated code.
8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
In this work, we propose a code bias testing framework and a large scale empirical study to uncover biases (e.g., age,
gender) in code generation models. Based on the framework, we assess current SOTA code generation models, and we
observe that all of the tested code generation models sometimes generate biased code functions. We observed that larger
language models do not mean fewer code bias behaviors. To mitigate bias in the code generation models, we propose
five bias mitigation templates. We release our dataset and source code in https://github.com/huangd1999/CBS. In our
future work, we will evaluate more code generation models (e.g., Gemini, Copilot, and CodeX), more bias attributes (e.g.,
culture), and more scenarios (e.g., academy admission).
