Abstract
In recent years, there has been a growing in-
terest in the development of language models
capable of generating text with controllable
attributes. While several approaches have
been proposed, many of these methods require
condition-speciÔ¨Åc data or signiÔ¨Åcant compu-
tational resources. In this study, we propose
a novel method called G AMMA SAMPLING ,
which enables controllable language genera-
tion without the need for any training data and
maintains a fast generation speed. G AMMA
SAMPLING incorporates attribute-related in-
formation into the sampling process, effec-
tively guiding the language model to produce
text with desired attributes. Our experimental
results demonstrate that G AMMA SAMPLING ,
when applied to GPT2, outperforms represen-
tative baselines in terms of diversity, attribute
relevance, and overall quality of the generated
samples.
1 Introduction
The emergence of large language models (LMs)
has been facilitated by the use of large-scale text
data obtained through web crawling. However,
while these models can produce high-quality texts,
there is limited control over the attributes of the
generated output. This poses a signiÔ¨Åcant chal-
lenge when utilizing unconditional LMs in scenar-
ios that demand precise control over the generated
text. Therefore, the Ô¨Åeld of controllable language
generation, which provides greater control over the
output of LMs, has become increasingly relevant
in practical applications.
Controllable language generation has made sig-
niÔ¨Åcant strides in recent years (Weng 2021). How-
ever, it remains an open question what the ideal
method for controlling the attributes of the gener-
ated language is (Mireshghallah et al. 2022, Yang
and Klein 2021, Meng et al. 2022). While training a
conditional LM from scratch (Keskar et al. 2019) or
Ô¨Åne-tuning an existing LM (Ziegler et al. 2019, Xuet al. 2021) have shown promising results, these ap-
proaches often require condition-speciÔ¨Åc data, mak-
ing them less applicable to unconditional LMs. Al-
ternatively, data-free methods have been proposed
(Shin et al. 2020, Zou et al. 2021, Ghazvininejad
et al. 2017, Pascual et al. 2020, Lu et al. 2021), but
they may have limitations in terms of steerability
or computational requirements.
This paper introduces a novel approach, called
GAMMA SAMPLING , that allows for the efÔ¨Åcient
and training-free control of LMs. The development
ofGAMMA SAMPLING is inspired by the concept
of gamma correction (Applebaum 1952), which
is a non-linear operation commonly used for en-
coding and decoding luminance in video or still
image systems. GAMMA SAMPLING is founded
on the principle that certain attributes of the gener-
ated text are closely associated with the presence of
speciÔ¨Åc tokens, and that by adjusting the probabil-
ity of these attribute-related tokens, the attributes
of the generated text can be controlled. Our main
contributions are as follows:
‚Ä¢GAMMA SAMPLING is a novel approach for
controlling LMs that do not require any train-
ing data, and therefore can be readily applied
to any LM.
‚Ä¢The method offers the ability to control
multiple attributes with Ô¨Åne-grained control
strength to users, who can determine the de-
sired level of attribute relevance, and can also
turn off the control at any time.
‚Ä¢AsGAMMA SAMPLING requires minimal
computation at the decoding time, its time
cost remains stable, regardless of the scale of
the input. Empirical analysis has revealed that
GAMMA SAMPLING is signiÔ¨Åcantly faster
than other baselines, such as PPLM (Dathathri
et al., 2020), with a generation time that is at
least 100faster.arXiv:2205.06036v5  [cs.CL]  21 Feb 2023

‚Ä¢The performance of GAMMA SAMPLING -
steered GPT2 was assessed through both auto-
matic and human evaluations, and compared
against various other commonly used methods.
Results indicate that the proposed method gen-
erally outperforms all baselines in terms of di-
versity, attribute relevance, and overall quality,
across all sizes of GPT2 (i.e. Small, Medium,
Large, and XL).
2 Background
The controllable language generation involves the
modelling of a probabilistic model p(tja), which
entails generating text t, based on a speciÔ¨Åed at-
tributea. A variety of approaches exist for achiev-
ing controllable language generation, each with its
advantages and limitations.
Conditional Language Model (CLM)
CLMs are a type of LM that is designed to
generate text based on certain conditions derived
from metadata. However, a large amount of
condition-speciÔ¨Åc data is necessary to train a CLM
effectively, and the computational cost of training
the entire model from scratch can be signiÔ¨Åcant,
making it a resource-intensive task. Additionally,
CLMs such as CTRL (Keskar et al. 2019) struggle
in controlling the generation of undesirable output,
such as detoxiÔ¨Åcation and anti-degeneration
(Gehman et al. 2020, Ma et al. 2020).
Fine-tuned Language Model (FTLMs)
FTLMs are an effective solution for balancing
training costs and generation quality, as demon-strated by recent research (Ziegler et al. 2019, Xu
et al. 2021). These models rely on pre-existing
large LMs, with the weights Ô¨Åne-tuned for speciÔ¨Åc
tasks or attributes. Fine-tuning can be limited to
the top or additional layers, or introduced through
discriminators (Krause et al. 2021, Liu et al. 2021).
However, it is important to note that FTLMs still
require condition-speciÔ¨Åc data. Furthermore, while
models such as PPLM (Dathathri et al. 2020)
that involve combining multiple small attribute
models with a large LM have shown promising
results, they may lead to decreased computational
efÔ¨Åciency due to the need for multiple passes at
every decoding step.
Prompting Prompt engineering (Shin et al.
2020, Zou et al. 2021) has become an increasingly
prominent training-free approach. By providing
carefully crafted prompts, prompt engineering di-
rects large LMs (e.g., ChatGPT1) towards solving
speciÔ¨Åc tasks and generating more accurate and co-
herent outputs. However, it is noteworthy that the
results of these tasks are signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuenced
by small variations in the prompts (Kojima et al.
2022).
Guided Decoding Guided decoding is a
method that can be used to incorporate attribute-
related information into the score function for lan-
guage generation at the decoding time, allowing
for the modiÔ¨Åcation of candidate ranking scores.
This method has been explored in several stud-

ies (Ghazvininejad et al. 2017, Ghosh et al. 2017,
Pascual et al. 2020, Lu et al. 2021, Liu et al.
2021, Pascual et al. 2021). However, a signiÔ¨Å-
cant challenge associated with guided decoding is
the off-distribution issues when control strengths
are too strong. Another drawback is the increase
in time cost with the number of controlled tokens,
which can result in long inference times when there
are many controlled tokens. In contrast, Section
3.2 presents the proposed method, GAMMA SAM-
PLING , which can mitigate or eliminate these dis-
advantages.
As illustrated in Fig. 1, it is evident that to
achieve controllable generation, LMs must be sup-
plied with attribute-related information. The Ô¨Årst
two approaches rely on extensive training of LMs
to acquire attribute-related information from vast
amounts of data. Conversely, the latter two believe
that large LMs have already acquired sufÔ¨Åcient
information from data and only require the intro-
duction of attribute-related information into the
input or decoding to be implemented for various
downstream tasks.
3 Methodology
This section provides an overview of gamma cor-
rection in Section 3.1, and goes on to present an in-
depth analysis of the technical aspects of GAMMA
SAMPLING in Section 3.2. Finally, Section 3.3 in-
troduces the practical application of GAMMA SAM-
PLING to deÔ¨Åne various controllable attributes.
3.1 Gamma Correction
Gamma correction (Applebaum 1952) is a well-
known technique that was initially to compensate
for the non-linearity of the input-output character-
istic of Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays. Since
then, this technique has been widely used for a vari-
ety of purposes, including adjusting the saturation
of images. This approach applies a power func-
tion to all pixels of the input image, as the human
perception of brightness is known to be non-linear
(Neri 2009). In its simplest form, this correction
technique is mathematically expressed as a power-
law function:
Vout=AV
in; (1)
where the luminance value Vin2[0;1]is raised
to the power 2[0;+1)and multiplied by the
constantA(in the common case, A= 1) to get the
output value Vout2[0;1].

bilities by G AMMA SAMPLING . When  <0:5, the
probabilities are increased. Conversely, when  >0:5,
the probabilities are decreased.
3.2 G AMMA SAMPLING
3.2.1 Basic Principles
In linguistic research, it has been observed that the
frequency of any word in common corpora is in-
versely proportional to its ranking in the frequency
table (Powers 1998). Given this observation, it
is reasonable to employ non-linear processes for
tuning the probabilities of attribute-related tokens.
Temperature sampling (Dabre and Fujita 2021), as
one example, is also based on a non-linear opera-
tion to scale the probability distribution.
The non-linear nature of languages indicates that
gamma correction may also be used to control text
attributes. In this context, the manipulation of text
attributes is referred to as GAMMA SAMPLING ,
with its fundamental operation formalized as fol-
lows:
pAout=ptan( 

tails.
wherepAinis the sum of the input probabilities
of all tokens in the attribute-related token set A,
pAoutis the output one, and  2[0;1]is the control
strength. As shown in Fig. 2, the control strength
 determines the degree to which the probabili-
ties of these tokens increase or decrease, and the
increase and decrease in probabilities occur over
equal length ranges. When   = 0:5, there is no
change in the probability distribution, while when
 <0:5, the probabilities of the attribute-related
tokens increase and vice versa.
It is important to consider the potential risks
of using GAMMA SAMPLING on its own. When
setting  to a very low level, even tokens with
low probability may experience a signiÔ¨Åcant in-
crease in their probabilities, which may result in
off-distribution. Therefore, it is advisable to use
either top-ksampling (Fan et al., 2018) or nucleus
sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) before GAMMA
SAMPLING to eliminate these unreliable attribute-
related tokens.
GAMMA SAMPLING is an innovative approach
that sets it apart from other methods. Notably, it
operates on probability distributions rather than
the logits (Liu et al. 2021), allowing for top- kor
nucleus sampling to be applied before it, thereby
avoiding over-control strengths that may result in
off-distribution. Additionally, GAMMA SAMPLING
eliminates the need for customization of the score
function (Ghazvininejad et al. 2017), additional
discriminators (Krause et al. 2021), or the use of
speciÔ¨Åc external models (Pascual et al. 2021). This
method requires only minimal computation at the
decoding time, and therefore is computationally ef-
Ô¨Åcient and independent of the number of controlled
tokens, resulting in a nearly constant time cost.3.2.2 Controlling Single Attribute
The use of GAMMA SAMPLING in Ô¨Åne-grained
control involves the scaling of probabilities asso-
ciated with attribute-related tokens. To achieve
optimal steerability, certain post-processing steps
must be taken, which include the ability to scale the
sum of probabilities of attribute-related tokens to 0
or 1, maintaining the ratio of probabilities between
tokens of the same type (i.e., attribute-related or
non-attribute-related), and ensuring the validity of
the output probability distribution. The process of
controlling a single attribute using GAMMA SAM-
PLING can be formalized as follows:
pAout=ptan( 

Ain;
paout=painpAout
pAin;8a2A;
pnout=pnin(1 +pAin pAout
pnAin);8n =2A;(3)
wherepainis the input probability of an attribute-
related token a,paoutis the output one, and the
same goes for every non-attribute-related token
n2 nA . Eq. 3 Ô¨Årst modiÔ¨Åes the sum of the
input probabilities of all attribute-related tokens
pAin, then rescales each attribute-related token a
by the ratio of pAouttopAin, and Ô¨Ånally rescales
the probability of each non-attribute-related token
nby the ratio of the difference between pAinand
pAoutto the sum of the input probabilities of all
non-attribute-related tokens pnAin. Fig. 3 illus-
trates a simple example of language generation
with G AMMA SAMPLING .
3.2.3 Controlling Multiple Attributes
In situations where multiple attributes A1:T=
fA1;A2;:::;ATgneed to be controlled in a se-
quential manner, if simply utilizing the equation
deÔ¨Åned in Eq. 3, the earlier modiÔ¨Åcations may be
overridden by later ones. To mitigate this issue,
supplementary computations have been introduced
to complement Eq. 3. When controlling the t-th at-
tributeAt, the following processes are performed:
Ft=A1[A2[:::[At 1 At;
pAt
out=ptan( t

--- PAGE 5 ---
where  trepresents the control strength for the
attribute setAt, and the frozen set Ftconsists of
attribute-related tokens that have been modiÔ¨Åed
in previous turns but not in At. Like Eq. 3, the
sum of token probabilities after modiÔ¨Åcation in
Eq. 4 remains 1. The key distinction between the
two equations is the inclusion of the frozen set Ft,
where token probabilities remain unchanged during
thet-th turn.
3.3 Controllable Attributes
In our empirical research and analysis, we identi-
Ô¨Åed six controllable attributes at the token level.
These attributes were utilized in Section 4 to ex-
plore their potential impact on generated text.
SENTENCE LENGTH is an objective text at-
tribute that is directly linked to ending marks such
as full stops, question marks, and exclamation
marks. By manipulating the frequency of these
ending marks, the average sentence length can be
effectively altered.
PERFECT ENDING is a dynamic tuning strategy
ofSENTENCE LENGTH . When the number of gen-
erated words exceeds a certain threshold, the value
of decreases linearly with the increase in the num-
ber of generated words. This process is designed
to ensure that the text does not end abruptly.
TOPIC RELEVANCE is controlled by selecting
words that are most related to a user-given topic
word, as calculated by the cosine similarity of word
embedding in GPT2. In our speciÔ¨Åc implementa-
tion, we selected the top 100 tokens.
SENTIMENT POLARITY is achieved by adjust-
ing the frequency of words in two wordlists, each
containing roughly 1000 words sourced from the
internet. One list is comprised of negative words,
while the other contains positive words.
REPETITION DECREASING , similar to penalized
sampling (Keskar et al. 2019), prevents degenera-
tion by decreasing the probabilities of tokens that
have recently been generated.
RELATEDNESS INCREASING is a dynamic tun-
ing strategy of TOPIC RELEVANCE that aims to
improve the coherence of text by encouraging the
generation of words that are closely related to re-
cently presented nouns labelled by NLTK (Keskar
et al. 2019).
By deÔ¨Åning the attributes of interest at the token
level, GAMMA SAMPLING allows for effective and
targeted manipulation of the generated text.4 Experiments
To evaluate GAMMA SAMPLING , a series of exper-
iments were conducted. The metrics used in this
evaluation are described in Section 4.1. In Section
4.2, we validate the Ô¨Åne-grained control achieved
byGAMMA SAMPLING and examine the impact
of varying degrees of control strength. Finally, we
conduct a comparative study in Section 4.3. The
Ô¨Åndings of this section better the understanding of
GAMMA SAMPLING and its potential applications
in various domains.
4.1 Metrics
The evaluation of generated texts involves assess-
ing four key aspects: Ô¨Çuency, diversity, attribute
relevance, and overall quality. A comprehensive
evaluation was conducted by utilizing both auto-
matic metrics and human annotators sourced from
Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk. To ensure the accu-
racy of the metrics, the text prompts, which include
attribute information, were excluded from the ex-
perimental data, while the preÔ¨Åxes were retained.
Fluency The Ô¨Çuency of the generated text is
measured by GPT2 in different sizes, based on
perplexity (Vinyals and Le 2015). A higher PPL,
indicates that it is less likely that GPT2 will gener-
ate such text. It is worth noting that a lower PPL
does not necessarily imply better quality, as degen-
erated text usually has a very low PPL, which is
deemed to be of poor quality.
Diversity The diversity of the generated sam-
ples is evaluated using DIST-N scores (Li et al.
2016). A higher value of DIST-N indicates a higher
proportion of distinct N-grams.
Attribute Relevance We focused on evaluat-
ing three types of controllable generation: SEN-
TENCE LENGTH ,TOPIC RELEVANCE andSEN-
TIMENT POLARITY . The average sentence length
(ASL ) measures the average number of words per
sentence. The latter two are evaluated using two
metrics based on external classiÔ¨Åers23: external
classiÔ¨Åer accuracy ( ECA ) and external classiÔ¨Åer
conÔ¨Ådence ( ECC ). The higher the ECA and ECC,
the more salient the external classiÔ¨Åer considers the
generated text to hold a certain topic/sentiment.
Overall Quality The overall quality of
machine-generated text was evaluated based on the

TOEFL Independent Writing Rubrics4, which are
widely used to assess the English writing skills of
non-native speakers. However, additional consider-
ations were taken into account to ensure a compre-
hensive evaluation of the machine-generated text.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we do not take into account whether
the text itself is Ô¨Ånished or contains factual errors,
but extensive repetition, completely off-topic, or
obvious common sense errors would result in a low
score. This revised set of criteria is TOEFL Writ-
ing Rubrics for Machine-generated Text ( T4MT ).
MTurkers are asked to rate each generated text on
a scale of 0 to 5 (nonsense to advanced) based on
T4MT. More information about this scoring crite-
rion can be found in Appendix A.
4.2 Control and Over-Control Analysis
In these experiments, we evaluated GPT2-Small on
SENTENCE LENGTH . The generation process was
initiated with the preÔ¨Åx "The issue focused" and the
model was instructed to generate the subsequent
100 tokens. To guarantee that each sample con-
tained at least one ending mark, we implemented
PERFECT ENDING . This involved linearly decreas-
ing the value of  to 0 as the number of generated
tokens increased, starting from the 80th token. Rep-
resentative samples of SENTENCE LENGTH can be
found in Appendix B.
We Ô¨Årst investigated Ô¨Åne-grained control using
GAMMA SAMPLING . SpeciÔ¨Åcally, 100 samples
were generated from GPT2 for each of ten different
values of  , resulting in a total of 1000 samples.
Our results show a clear correlation between  and
the ASL of the generated text. Fig. 4 illustrates that
ASL increases signiÔ¨Åcantly with increasing  , from
an average of 12.98 words/sentence at   = 0:1to
an average of 95.68 words/sentence at   = 1:0. For

comparison, the ASL of text generated by GPT2-
Small is 38.39 at   = 0:5. This result reveals a
linear relationship between ASL and  , suggesting
that the probability scaling of attribute-related to-
kens has a non-linear impact on the corresponding
attribute. Additionally, without PERFECT ENDING ,
sentences will not end when   = 1:0.
We then assessed the risk of over-control
strength. To achieve this, we conducted an ex-
periment wherein we selected three representative
values of  (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9) and applied nucleus
sampling with varying top- p(0.8, 0.9 and 1.0). We
generated 100 samples in each of the nine settings,
and as we hypothesized, we found that increasing
the probability of controlled tokens led to a signiÔ¨Å-
cant decrease in the quality of the generated text, as
evidenced by Table 1. With a top- pvalue of 1.0 and
a value of 0.1, the PPL of the generated samples
reached an astonishingly high value of 6844.1, indi-
cating that it would be extremely difÔ¨Åcult for GPT2-
Small to generate such text. However, we observed
that reducing the top- pvalue effectively mitigated
the negative impact of GAMMA SAMPLING on the
quality of generated text. For example, with a top- p
value of 0.8 and a  value of 0.1, the PPL dropped
dramatically to 16.53. In contrast, the impact of
drastically reducing the probability of controlled
tokens (   = 0:9) was much less signiÔ¨Åcant.
In conclusion, the experimental results demon-
strate that GAMMA SAMPLING can effectively
modify the attributes of generated text. To miti-
gate the negative effects of over-control strength,
pre-sampling should be applied.

number of keywords used. In contrast, the time cost of GAMMA SAMPLING is insensitive to the number
of controlled tokens, resulting in similar generation times for GS and GSM.

  = 0:1.
GSM In addition to TOPIC RELEVANCE or
SENTIMENT POLARITY , this method enables mul-
tiple controllable attributes, i.e., REPETITION DE-
CREASING (  = 0:9) and RELATEDNESS IN-
CREASING (  = 0:3).

gpt2-medium-topic-newslarge news corpus for topic-controllable generation.
This method demonstrates good zero-shot gener-
ation performance as long as the topic is a single
word and not too speciÔ¨Åc.
PPLM-BCR (Dathathri et al. 2020) This
method guides GPT2-Medium and has two differ-
ent schemes for TOPIC RELEVANCE andSENTI -
MENT POLARITY . Both of these schemes produce
10 samples, and the optimal sample is chosen based
on its log-likelihood. The combined reference to
both schemes is denoted as PPLM-BCR.
K2T (Pascual et al. 2021) A guided decoding
method modiÔ¨Åes the score function to encourage
GPT2-Large to generate more words that are se-
mantically similar to a given keyword set. The

--- PAGE 8 ---
selected keyword set was the same as that used
forGAMMA SAMPLING to ensure comparability.
However, as the number of controlled tokens in-
creases, the time cost of this method rises linearly,
and the generation time becomes unacceptable
when all keywords from the SENTIMENT POLAR -
ITY(10,000 sec/sample) are used. Following
the default setting for this method, a subset of 5
attribute-related tokens was randomly selected as
keywords for each K2T-generated sample.
CTRL (Keskar et al. 2019) A conditional
transformer-based LM trained from scratch to con-
dition control codes, also known as prompts. This
model has 1.6 billion parameters.
In this experiment, we followed the experimental
procedures established by PPLM (Dathathri et al.
2020) and investigated the performance of mod-
els across three topics, namely COMPUTERS ,LEGAL ,
andSCIENCE , as well as two sentiment polarities,
NEGATIVE andPOSITIVE . Given ethical considera-
tions, we excluded topics related to POLITICS and
RELIGION . For each task, 100 essays were gener-
ated by each model, with a length of 100 words
per essay. To generate the essays, we used pre-
Ô¨Åxes such as The issue focused for topics and
The movie for sentiments, along with their respec-
tive prompts if available. For all methods in this
experiment, we applied nucleus sampling with a
top-p= 0:8. In total, 8000 samples were generated
for automatic evaluation, and 2400 samples were
selected for human evaluation. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we
selected the Ô¨Årst 30 generations for each model per
task, resulting in a total of 7285 valid ratings, with
each sample being reviewed by at least 3 MTurkers.
For further details, see Appendix C for samples
from all methods.
The results presented in Table 2 indicate that
the PPL of GS-generated text is lower than that
of GPT2, which suggests that the former produces
less complex text. However, the GS-generated text
displays the lowest diversity as measured by DIST-
N. Upon manual examination, we found that GS-
generated text tended to suffer from a higher de-
gree of degeneration compared to GPT2-generated
text, with a higher likelihood of repeating words
with similar semantics to the topic words. It indi-
cates that using only TOPIC RELEVANCE orSEN-
TIMENT POLARITY to control GPT2 did not yield
favourable results in the controllable language gen-
eration task. In contrast, we found that GSM pro-
duced highly diverse text as measured by DIST-N,while maintaining a high attribute relevance as in-
dicated by the ECA and ECC. Although there was
a slight decrease in Ô¨Çuency as measured by PPL,
the quality of the text generated by GSM remained
acceptable as suggested by T4MT. These Ô¨Åndings
suggest that using both REPETITION DECREAS -
INGandRELATEDNESS INCREASING together can
signiÔ¨Åcantly improve the quality of the generated
text without going off-distribution.
In terms of T4MT, most methods demonstrated
comparable results, while independent samples t-
tests revealed that the GSM results were statisti-
cally signiÔ¨Åcant when compared to all other meth-
ods, with ap-value<0.05 (excluding PPLM-BCR,
which had a p-value of 0.051). Although we cannot
assert the statistical superiority of GSM-generated
text over that of PPLM-BCR, it is notable that the
generation time of PPLM-BCR is at least 100 
longer than that of GSM, as indicated in Table 3.
The guided decoding baseline, K2T, has been
found to generate text that is more off-topic when
compared to GAMMA SAMPLING as measured by
ECA and ECC. This difference in performance
is likely because K2T used smaller keyword sets
(only 5 words/set) and a weaker control strength
to prevent off-distribution issues. In contrast, the
generation time of GAMMA SAMPLING remains
relatively consistent, and the negative impacts of
strong control strength are effectively mitigated
through the use of pre-sampling.
5 Conclusions
In this paper, we introduce a new technique called
GAMMA SAMPLING , which provides a highly ef-
Ô¨Åcient method for Ô¨Åne-grained control of LMs at
the token level. The technique involves incorpo-
rating attribute-related information at the decoding
time and enables the pre-deÔ¨Ånition or selection of
attributes by the LMs themselves without requiring
any additional training data. Experimental results
demonstrate that GAMMA SAMPLING is highly ef-
fective in controlling GPT2, producing improved
objective and subjective metrics while maintaining
a fast generation speed. Additionally, our method
has been shown to be computationally efÔ¨Åcient
and able to avoid off-distribution issues. Since
GAMMA SAMPLING is a training-free approach, it
is easily adaptable to any LM and has the potential
to enhance the efÔ¨Åciency and user-friendliness of
controllable language generation.

Limitations
While GAMMA SAMPLING has been shown to be
an effective method for Ô¨Åne-grained controlling
of LMs, there is still room for improvement and
further research in this area.
As a guided decoding method, GAMMA SAM-
PLING relies on pre-deÔ¨Åned or selected attribute-
related tokens to guide the generation process. This
means that the quality of the generated text is de-
pendent on the quality of the selection of tokens.
Furthermore, the attribute-related tokens must be
selected by humans or LMs themselves, which may
be prone to errors or bias. Improving the reliabil-
ity and robustness of attribute information is an
important future direction.
In addition, GAMMA SAMPLING is currently
only able to control attributes at the token level.
While this allows for Ô¨Åne-grained control, it may
be limited in its ability to control more complex or
abstract attributes (e.g., writing style). Developing
methods to control these types of attributes is a key
area for future research.
Ethics Statement
As with any technology, there are potential ethical
considerations to be taken into account with the use
ofGAMMA SAMPLING . One of the issues we have
identiÔ¨Åed in conducting experiments is the poten-
tial for bias in the attribute information provided to
guide the generation process. If the attribute infor-
mation is provided by humans, it may be prone to
bias based on the human annotator‚Äôs own beliefs,
experiences, or stereotypes. On the other hand, if
the attribute information is selected by the LMs
themselves, it may be like an echo chamber, which
further ampliÔ¨Åes any biases present in the train-
ing data used to train the LMs. For this reason,
we excluded topics where models could generate
offensive text (i.e., POLITICS andRELIGION ).
To mitigate this risk, we recommend that
attribute-related tokens be carefully curated and
checked for bias before being used in the genera-
tion process. In addition, it is important to ensure
that the selection of attribute-related tokens is di-
verse and inclusive, to avoid perpetuating stereo-
types or discrimination.
