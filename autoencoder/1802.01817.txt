ABSTRACT
This article proposes to auto-encode text at byte-level using convolutional net-
works with a recursive architecture. The motivation is to explore whether it is
possible to have scalable and homogeneous text generation at byte-level in a non-
sequential fashion through the simple task of auto-encoding. We show that non-
sequential text generation from a ﬁxed-length representation is not only possible,
but also achieved much better auto-encoding results than recurrent networks. The
proposed model is a multi-stage deep convolutional encoder-decoder framework
using residual connections (He et al., 2016), containing up to 160 parameterized
layers. Each encoder or decoder contains a shared group of modules that consists
of either pooling or upsampling layers, making the network recursive in terms of
abstraction levels in representation. Results for 6 large-scale paragraph datasets
are reported, in 3 languages including Arabic, Chinese and English. Analyses are
conducted to study several properties of the proposed model.

Figure 1: The autoencoder modelRecently, generating text using
convolutional networks (ConvNets)
starts to become an alternative to
recurrent networks for sequence-to-
sequence learning (Gehring et al.,
2017). The dominant assumption for
both these approaches is that texts
are generated one word at a time.
Such sequential generation process
bears the risk of output or gradient
vanishing or exploding problem
(Bengio et al., 1994), which limits
the length of its generated results.
Such limitation in scalability prompts
us to explore whether non-sequential
text generation is possible.
Meanwhile, text processing from
lower levels than words – such as
characters (Zhang et al., 2015) (Kim et al., 2016) and bytes (Gillick et al., 2016) (Zhang & Le-
Cun, 2017) – is also being explored due to its promise in handling distinct languages in the same

fashion. In particular, the work by Zhang & LeCun (2017) shows that simple one-hot encoding on
bytes could give the best results for text classiﬁcation in a variety of languages. The reason is that it
achieved the best balance between computational performance and classiﬁcation accuracy. Inspired
by these results, this article explores auto-encoding for text using byte-level convolutional networks
that has a recursive structure, as a ﬁrst step towards low-level and non-sequential text generation.
For the task of text auto-encoding, we should avoid the use of common attention mechanisms like
those used in machine translation Bahdanau et al. (2015), because they always provide a direct in-
formation path that enables the auto-encoder to directly copy from the input. This diminishes the
purpose of studying the representational ability of different models. Therefore, all models consid-
ered in this article would encode to and decode from a ﬁxed-length vector representation.
The paper by Zhang et al. (2017) was an anterior result on using word-level convolutional networks
for text auto-encoding. This article differs from it in several key ways of using convolutional net-
works. First of all, our models work from the level of bytes instead of words, which arguably makes
the problem more challenging. Secondly, our network is dynamic with a recursive structure that
scales with the length of input text, which by design could avoid trivial solutions for auto-encoding
such as the identity function. Thirdly, by using the latest design heuristics such as residual connec-
tions (He et al., 2016), our network can scale up to several hundred of layers deep, compared to a
static network that contains a few layers.
In this article, several properties of the auto-encoding model are studied. The following is a list.
1. Applying the model to 3 languages – Arabic, Chinese and English – shows that the model
can handle all different languages in the same fashion with equally good accuracy.
2. Comparisons with long short-term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)
show a signiﬁcant advantage of using convolutional networks for text auto-encoding.
3. We determined that a recursive convolutional decoder like ours can accurately produce the
end-of-string byte, despite that the decoding process is non-sequential.
4. By studying the auto-encoding error when the samples contain randomized noisy bytes, we
show that the model does not degenerate to the identity function. However, it can neither
denoise the input very well.
5. The recursive structure requires a pooling layer. We compared between average pooling,
L2 pooling and max-pooling, and determined that max-pooling is the best choice.
6. The advantage of recursion is established by comparison against a static model that does
not have shared module groups. This shows that linguistic heuristics such as recursion is
useful for designing models for language processing.
7. We also explored models of different sizes by varying the maximum network depth from
40 to 320. The results show that deeper models give better results.
2 B YTE-LEVEL RECURSIVE CONVOLUTIONAL AUTO-ENCODER
In this section, we introduce the design of the convolutional auto-encoder model with a recursive
structure. The model consists of 6 groups of modules, with 3 for the encoder and 3 for the decoder.
The model ﬁrst encodes a variable-length input into a ﬁxed-length vector of size 1024, then decodes
back to the same input length. The decoder architecture is a reverse mirror of the encoder. All
2

--- PAGE 3 ---
convolutional layers in this article have zero-padding added to ensure that each convolutional layer
outputs the same length as the input. They also all have feature size 256 and kernel size 3. All
parameterized layers in our model use ReLU (Nair & Hinton, 2010) as the non-linearity.
In the encoder, the ﬁrst group of modules consist of ntemporal (1-D) convolutional layers. It ac-
cepts an one-hot encoded sequence of bytes as input, where each byte is encoded as a 256-dimension
vector. This ﬁrst group of modules transforms the input into an internal representation. We call this
group of modules the preﬁx group. The second group of modules consists of ntemporal convolu-
tional layers plus one max-pooling layer of size 2. This group reduces the length of input by a factor
of 2, and it can be applied again and again to recursively reduce the representation length. There-
fore, we name this second group the recursion group. The recursion group is applied until the size
of representation becomes 1024, which is actually a feature of dimension 256 and length 4. Then,
following the ﬁnal recursion group is a postﬁx group of nlinear layers for feature transformation.

Figure 3: The reshaping process. This demon-
strates the reshaping process for transforming a
representation of feature size 4 and length 8 to
feature size 2 and length 16. Differen colors rep-
resent different source features, and the numbers
are indices in length dimension.The decoder is a symmetric reverse mirror of
the encoder. The decoder preﬁx group consists
ofnlinear layers, followed by a decoder recur-
sion group that expand the length of representa-
tion by a factor of 2. This expansion is done at
the ﬁrst convolutional layer of this group, where
it outputs 512 features that will be reshaped into
256 features. The reshaping process we use en-
sures that feature values correspond to nearby
ﬁeld of view in the input, which is similar to
the idea of sub-pixel convolution (or pixel shuf-
ﬂing) (Shi et al., 2016). Figure 3 depics this re-
shaping process for transforming representation
of feature size 4 and length 8 to feature size 2
and length 16. After this recursion group is ap-
plied several times (same as that of the encoder
recursion group), a decoder postﬁx group of n
convolutional layers is applied to decode the re-
cursive features into a byte sequence.
The ﬁnal output of the decoder is interpreted as
probabilities of bytes after passing through a softmax function. Therefore, the loss we use is simply
negative-log likelihood on the individual softmax outputs. It is worth noting that this does not
imply that the output bytes are unconditionally independent of each other. For our non-sequential
text decoder, the independence between output bytes is conditioned on the representation from the
encoder, meaning that their mutual dependence is modeled by the decoder itself. Figure 2 illustrates
the difference between sequential and non-sequential text generation using graphical models.
Depending on the length of input and size of the encoded representation, our model can be extremely
deep. For example, with n= 8 and encoding dimension 1024 (reduced to a length 4 with 256
features), for a sample length of 1024 bytes, the entire model has 160 parameterized layers. Training
such a deep dynamic model can be very challenging using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) due
to the gradient vanishing problem (Bengio et al., 1994). Therefore, we use the recently proposed
idea of residual connections (He et al., 2016) to make optimization easier. For every pair of adjacent
parameterized layers, the input feature representation is passed through to the output by addition.
We were unable to train a model designed in this fashion without such residual connections.
For all of our models, we use an encoded representation of dimension 1024 (recursed to length of
4 with 256 features). For an input sample of arbitrary length l, we ﬁrst append the end-of-sequence
null byte to it, and then pad it to length 2dlog2(l+1)ewith all zero vectors. This makes the input length
a base-2 exponential of some integer, since the recursion groups in both encoder and decoder either
reduce or expand the length of representation by a factor of 2. If l <4, it is padded to size of 4 and
does not pass through the recursion groups. It is easy to see that the depth of this dynamic network
for a sample of length lis on the order of log2l, potentially making the hidden representations more
efﬁcient and easier to learn than recurrent networks which has a linear order in depth.

our model can be applied to all languages in the same fashion. We also constructed a dataset with
samples mixed in all three languages to test the model’s ability to handle multi-lingual data.

our largest model.

we used has n= 8 – that is, there are
8 parameterized layers in each of pre-
ﬁx, recursion and postﬁx module groups,
for both the encoder and decoder. Each
training epoch contains 1,000,000 steps,
and each step is trained on a randomly
selected sample with length up to 1024
bytes. Therefore, the maximum model
depth is 160. We only back-propagate
through valid bytes in the output. Note that
each sample contains a end-of-sequence byte (“null” byte) by design.
We set the initial learning rate to 0.001, and half it every 10 epoches. A momentum of 0.9 is applied
to speed up training. A small weight decay of 0.00001 is used to stabilize training. Depending on
the length of each sample, the encoder or decoder recursion groups are applied for a certain number
of times. We ﬁnd that dividing the gradients of these recursion groups by the number of shared
clones can speed up training. The trainng process stops at the 100th epoch.

Table 2 details the byte-level errors for
our model on all of the aforementioned

models can achieve very good error rates
for auto-encoding in different languages.
The result for allgiga dataset also indicates
that the model has no trouble in learning
from multi-lingual datasets that contains
samples of very different languages.
4 D ISCUSSION
This section offers comparisons with recurrent networks, and studies on a set of different properties
of our proposed auto-encoding model. Most of these results are performed using the enwiki dataset.
4.1 C OMPARISON WITH RECURRENT NETWORKS
We constructed a simple baseline recurrent network using the “vanilla” long short-term memory
units (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). In this model, both input and output bytes are embedded
into vectors of dimension 1024 so that we can use a hidden representation of dimension 1024. The

encoder reads the text in reverse order, which was observed by Sutskever et al. (2014) reversing the
input sequence can improve quality of outputs. The 1024-dimension hidden output of the last cell is
used as the input for the decoder.
The decoder also and input and output bytes embedded into vectors of dimension 1024 and use a
hidden representation of dimension 1024. During decoding, the most recently generated byte is
fed to the next time step. This is called “teacher forcing” which is observed to improve the auto-
encoding result in our case. The decoding process uses a beam search algorithm of size 2. During
learning, we only back-propagate through the most likely sequence after beam search.
Table 3 details the result for LSTM. The byte-level errors are so large that the results of our models in
table 2 are at least one magnitude of doing better. The fundamental limitation of recurrent networks
is that regardless of the level of entity (word, character or byte), they can remember around up to
50 of them accurately, and then failed to accurate predict them afterwards. By construction our
recursive non-sequential text generation process could hopefully be an alternative solution for this,
as already evident in the results here.

Figure 6: Byte-level error by lengthOne thing that makes a difference be-
tween sequential and non-sequential text
generation is how to decide when to end
the generated string of bytes. For se-
quential generative process such as re-
current decoders, we could stop when
some end-of-sequence symbol is gener-
ated. For non-sequential generative pro-
cess, we could regard the ﬁrst encountered
end-of-sequence symbol as the mark for
end, despite that it will inevitably generate
some extra symbols after it. Then, a natu-
ral question to ask it, is this simple way of
determining end-of-sequence effective?
To answer this question, we computed the
difference of end-of-sequence symbols be-
tween generated text and its groundtruth for 1,000,000 samples, for both the training and testing
subsets of the enwiki dataset. What we discovered is that the distribution of length difference is
highly concentrated at 0, at 99.63% for both training and testing. Figure 4 shows the full histogram,
in which length differences other than 0 is barely visible. This suggests that our non-sequential text
generation process can model the end-of-sequence position pretty accurately. One reason for this is
that for every samples we have an end-of-sequence symbol – the “null” byte – such that the network
has learned to model it pretty early on during the training process.

4.3 R ANDOM PERMUTATION OF SAMPLES
One potential problem speciﬁc to the task if auto-encoding is the risk of learning the degenerate
solution – the identity function. One way to test this is to mutate the input bytes randomly and
see whether the error rates match with the mutation probability. We experimented with mutation
probability from 0 to 1 with an interval of 0.1, and for each case we tested the byte-level errors for
100,000 samples in both training and testing subsets of the enwiki dataset.
Note that we can compute the byte-level errors in 2 ways. The ﬁrst is to compute the errors with
respect to the groundtruth samples. If the solution is degenerated to the identity function, then the
byte-level errors should correlate with the probability of mutation. The second is to compute the
errors with respect to the mutated samples. If the solution is degenerated to the identity function,
then the byte-level errors should be near 0 regardless of the mutation probability. Figure 5 shows
the results in these 2 ways of computing errors, and the result strongly indicates that the model has
not degenerated to learning the identity function.

ferent pooling layers

average 7.91% 7.98%
L2 6.85% 6.77%It is worth noting that the errors with respect to the groundtruth
samples in ﬁgure 5 also demonstrate that our model lacks the
ability to denoise mutated samples. This can be seen from
the phenomenon that the errors for each mutation probability
is higher than the reference diagonal value, instead of lower.
This is due to the lack of a denoising criterion in our training
process.
4.4 S AMPLE LENGTH
We also conducted experiments to show how does the byte-
level errors vary with respect to the sample length. Figure 7
shows the histogram of sample lengths for all datasets. It indi-
cates that a majority of paragraph samples can be well modeled
under 1024 bytes. Figure 6 shows the byte-level error of our models with respect to the length of
samples. This ﬁgure is produced by testing 1,000,000 samples from each of training and testing
subsets of enwiki dataset. Each bin in the histogram represent a range of 64 with the indicated upper
limit. For example, the error at 512 indicate errors aggregated for samples of length 449 to 512.
Table 5: Byte-level errors for re-
cursive and static models
MODEL TRAIN TEST
recursive 3.34% 3.34%
static 8.01% 8.05%One interesting phenomenon is that the errors are highly cor-
related with the number of recursion groups applied for both
the encoder and the decoder. In the plot, bins 64, 128, 192-
256, 320-512, 576-1024 represent recursion levels of 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 respectively. The errors for the same recursion level are
almost the same to each other, despite huge length differences
when the recursion levels get deep. The reason for this is also
related to the fact that there there tend to be more shorter texts
than longer ones in the dataset, as evidenced in ﬁgure 7.

4.5 P OOLING LAYERS
This section details an experiment in studying how do the
training and testing errors vary with the choice of pooling layers in the encoder network. The exper-
iments are conducted on the aforementioned model with n= 8, and replacing the max-pooling layer
in the encoder with average-pooling or L2-pooling layers. Table 4 details the result. The numbers
strongly indicate that max-pooling is the best choice. Max-pooling selects the largest values in its
ﬁeld of view, helping the network to achieve better optima (Boureau et al., 2010).

intuition that the structure may help the model to learn bet-
ter representations. However, there is to guarantee that such
intuition could be helpful for the model unless comparison is
done with a static model that takes ﬁxed-length inputs and pass
through a network with the same architecture of the recursion
groups without weight sharing.
Figure 8 shows the training and testing errors when training a
static model with the same hyper-parameters. The static model
takes 1024 bytes, and zero vectors are padded if the sample
length is smaller. The recursion group is therefore applied for
8 times in both the encoder and decoder, albeit their weights
are not shared. The result indicates that a recursive model not
only learns faster, but can also achieve better results. Table 5 lists the byte-level errors.
4.7 M ODEL DEPTH
This section explores whether varying the model size can make a different on the result. Table 6 lists
the training and testing errors of different model depths with n2 f2;4;8;16g. The result indicates
that best error rates are achieved with the largest model, with very little overﬁtting. This is partly
due to the fact that our datasets are quite large for the models in question.
5 C ONCLUSION
In this article, we propose to auto-encode text using a recursive convolutional network. The model
contains 6 parts – 3 for the encoder and 3 for the decoder. The encoder and decoder both contain
a preﬁx module group and a postﬁx module group for feature transformation. A recusion module
group is included in between the preﬁx and postﬁx for each of the encoder and decoder, which
8

--- PAGE 9 ---
recursively shrink or expand the length of representation. As a result, our model essentially generate
text in a non-sequential fashion.
Experiments using this model are done on 6 large scale datasets in Arabic, Chinese and English.
Comparison with recurrent networks is offered to show that our model achieved great results in text
auto-encoding. Properties of the proposed model are studied, including its ability to produce the
end-of-sequence symbol, whether the model degenerates to the identity function, and variations of
pooling layers, recursion and depth of models. In the future, we hope to extend our models to non-
sequential generative models without inputs, and use it for more sequence-to-sequence tasks such as
