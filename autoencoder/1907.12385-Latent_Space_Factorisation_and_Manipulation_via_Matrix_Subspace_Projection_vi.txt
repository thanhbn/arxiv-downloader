I have successfully created a complete Vietnamese translation of the research paper "Latent Space Factorisation and Manipulation via Matrix Subspace Projection" and saved it as `1907.12385_vi.txt` in the autoencoder directory.

## Translation Summary

The translation follows the established Vietnamese translation system format found in the repository:

### **Key Features:**
- **Professional Academic Vietnamese**: Used formal academic terminology throughout
- **Technical Accuracy**: Carefully translated technical terms like:
  - "Latent Space Factorisation" → "Phân Tích Nhân Tố Không Gian Tiềm Ẩn"
  - "Matrix Subspace Projection" → "Phép Chiếu Ma Trận Con"
  - "autoencoder" → "bộ tự mã hóa"
  - "attribute manipulation" → "thao tác thuộc tính"

### **Structure Maintained:**
- ✅ Standard Vietnamese header format with metadata
- ✅ Page markers (--- TRANG N ---)
- ✅ All sections, subsections, and mathematical equations
- ✅ Complete tables with Vietnamese headers
- ✅ All references and citations
- ✅ Figure captions and descriptions

### **File Details:**
- **Location**: `/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader/autoencoder/1907.12385_vi.txt`
- **Format**: Follows the established `_vi.txt` naming convention
- **Size**: Complete 11-page translation
- **Quality**: Professional academic standard suitable for Vietnamese ML/AI researchers

The translation is now ready and integrated into the existing Vietnamese translation system, maintaining consistency with the hundreds of other translated papers in the repository.
