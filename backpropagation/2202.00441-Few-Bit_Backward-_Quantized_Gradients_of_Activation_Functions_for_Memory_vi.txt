I have successfully translated the entire research paper "Few-Bit Backward: Quantized Gradients of Activation Functions for Memory Footprint Reduction" to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact structure and academic formatting while accurately conveying the technical content.

The translated file has been saved as `/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader/backpropagation/2202.00441_vi.txt` and includes all sections:

1. **Title and Abstract** - Complete translation of the paper summary
2. **Introduction** - Background and motivation for the research  
3. **Quantized Gradients of Activations** - Technical methodology section
4. **Optimal Piecewise-constant Approximation** - Mathematical framework
5. **Experiments** - Results and evaluations on various benchmarks
6. **Related Work** - Comparison with existing approaches
7. **Conclusion and References** - Summary and bibliography
8. **Appendices** - Detailed examples and memory measurements

All technical terms, equations, figures, tables, and references have been appropriately translated while preserving the scientific accuracy and academic tone of the original paper.
