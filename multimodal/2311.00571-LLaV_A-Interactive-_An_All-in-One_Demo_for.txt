Abstract
LLaV A-Interactive is a research prototype for multimodal human-AI interaction.
The system can have multi-turn dialogues with human users by taking multimodal
user inputs and generating multimodal responses. Importantly, LLaV A-Interactive
goes beyond language prompt, where visual prompt is enabled to align human
intents in the interaction. The development of LLaV A-Interactive is extremely
cost-efficient as the system combines three multimodal skills of pre-built AI models
without additional model training: visual chat of LLaV A [ 13], image segmentation
from SEEM [ 31], and image generation and editing from GLIGEN [ 11]. A diverse
set of application scenarios is presented to demonstrate the promises of LLaV A-
Interactive and to inspire future research in multimodal interactive systems.
1 Introduction
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) [ 17,5] has revolutionized chatbot systems.
As an example, OpenAI’s ChatGPT [ 16] has demonstrated unprecedented levels of intelligence for
human-AI interaction. The success of ChatGPT on language tasks has inspired the community to
anticipate expanding the success to the multimodal space to eventually develop general-purpose
multimodal AI agents [ 9]. The release of GPT-4V [ 18] is a big stride towards the goal. Although
GPT-4V demonstrates many impressive AI skills [ 27,15], building multimodal conversational AI
agents based solely on GPT-4V remains challenging for the open-source research community for two
reasons. (i)GPT-4V is primarily a language-based human-AI interaction system, where user-input
images mainly provide visual contexts for text input and the system can only produce responses in
text. (ii)The details of model training and system architecture are not disclosed.
To mitigate the challenges, we present LLaV A-Interactive, an open-source research prototype sys-
tem which can have multi-turn dialogues with human users by taking multimodal user inputs and
generating multimodal responses. LLaV A-Interactive combines three multimodal skills of pre-built
AI models without additional model training: visual chat of LLaV A [ 13], image segmentation from
SEEM [ 30], and image generation and editing from GLIGEN [ 11]. We hope that LLaV A-Interactive is
complementary to GPT-4V for the development of future multimodal AI agents as LLaV A-Interactive
provides a more extensible framework by supporting richer visual prompting and being open source.
•Visual Prompting . LLaV A-Interactive supports flexible language-vision human-AI interactions
by allowing human users to use diverse visual prompts, such as drawing strokes, drag and drop
or bounding boxes, to express user intents for completing sophisticated multimodal tasks that
involve image segmentation, generation and editing. As a result, we find that compared to
standalone LMMs, such as GPT-4V or LLaV A, LLaV A-Interactive can better follow user intents
and generate more engaged human-machine interaction experiences.

•Open-source . We make our system and code base publicly available to facilitate future improve-
ments in the community.
In the rest of this paper, Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 describes the interface, workflow,
and AI skills of LLaV A-Interactive. Section 4 presents a case study of developing an AI agent to
assist photographic artists using LLaV A-Interactive. Section 5 presents a preliminary evaluation of
LLaV A-Interactive.
2 Related Works
LMM with Visual Output and Interaction. Most existing LMMs are developed to support visual
chat – image understanding and reasoning. There are several exploratory studies to enable LMM to
support image output such as image generation/editing and segmentation, demonstrated in GILL [ 8],
CM3leon [ 29], Emu [ 20], DreamLLM [ 3], Kosmos-G [ 19] and MGIE [ 4]. The idea is generalized
to other modalities such as video and audio in NextGPT [ 26]. In contrast to model training to
enable image output, another line of research is to prompt engineer LLM for multimodal tool use
such as Visual ChatGPT [ 25], X-GPT [ 30], MM-REACT [ 28], VisProg [ 7], and ViperGPT [ 21],
where expert vision models with image output are activated in the inference time without any model
training. Both research lines have demonstrated the extended capabilities with image output in
LLMs. Similar to them, LLaV A-Interactive also supports image generation/editing and segmentation.
LLaV A-Interactive is different from existing works in two aspects: (i)LLaV A-Interactive is cheap in
development, as it is a synergy of the inference stages of three models. There is no model training,
and no prompt engineering of LLM. (ii)Importantly, LLaV A-Interactive emphasizes the support of
visual interaction, where a user can draw strokes to specify the human intent in segmentation and
generation/editing, a unique capability that existing visual assistant systems do not have.
Unified Multimodal Modeling. Inspired by the success of a single unified language model Chat-
GPT for language tasks, it is of great promise to build a general-purpose assistant with a single
multimodal foundation model to complete more complex tasks [ 9]. While the development of a
unified LMM for all vision-language tasks is still exploratory [ 30,10,6,2,14,23,24], it is be-
lieved that this direction has great promise in unlocking new application scenarios. We present
LLaV A-Interactive as a demo illustration of the potential of this research direction, including bridging
vision and language tasks, completing a wide range of tasks in the wild, and providing a multimodal
promptable user interface [9].
3 LLaV A-Interactive
Interface. Figure 1 visualizes the user interface of LLaV A-Interactive. The overall interface layout
is illustrated in (a), which consists of three panels annotated in different colors to ease the presentation.
The top-left panel in purple maintains the up-to-date image and accepts visual prompts such as user
strokes if necessary, the right panel in green is a language-based chat interface that accepts user
questions about the image, and responds in natural language. The lower-left section, highlighted in
blue, represents the visual interaction interface, which comprises three tabs. Each tab is distinguished
by its unique function and is displayed within a red rounded rectangle.
To illustrate how humans can interact with LLaV A-Interactive using visual prompts, we provide one
example for each tab in the sub-figures of Figure 1. (b) Remove or Change Objects. For an image,
the user draws a stroke on the object of interest. After clicking the “ Segment ” button, the object
segmentation mask is provided, e.g., the pier is highlighted in the magenta mask in this example.
By dragging the mask out of the image, and clicking the “ Generate ” button, an edited image that
removes the object is generated, e.g., the pier is removed in this example. (c) Inpaint New Objects.
To add objects with precise size and position in the image, the user could specify the object spatial
configurations using bounding boxes. Each drawing corresponds a minimum size box that contains
the stroke. The semantic concepts of the objects are provided in the grounding instruction (separated
by a semicolon). By clicking the “ Generate ” button, the desired objects are inpainted in the input
image, e.g., a boat a duck are added in the lake, and a bird is added on the sky in this example.
(d)Generate New Image. To generate a new completely new image with precise object spatial
layouts, one may specify the object layout using bounding boxes on “ Sketch Pad ”, and provide
the image-level caption as the language instruction. By clicking “ Generate ” button, a new image

three main panels, among which the visual interaction panel consists of three tabs based on their
functionalities. They are shown in magenta rounded rectangles, and detailed in (b,c,d), whose image

that contains desired scene layout is generated. In this example, a new visual scene is generated to
visualize the semantics of a boat on the lake, with mountains in the background. At any given time,
users can effortlessly switch among the three visual interaction tabs to fulfill their intended visual
creation requirements iteratively.
Workflow. Figure 2 provides a workflow of LLaV A-Interactive. We describe the typical visual
creation process as below:
(1)Image Input: To start, an image is required. The user can either upload an image or generate
one by providing a language caption and drawing bounding boxes to establish the spatial
arrangement of objects. Once the image is prepared, it can be interacted with through one of
three methods: chat, segmentation, or editing.
(2)Visual Chat: Users can ask questions about the image, such as seeking suggestions for revisions.
Based on the editing recommendations, objects can be removed or added using Steps 3 or 4,
respectively.
(3)Interactive Segmentation: Users can create an object mask using either a stroke drawing or a text
prompt. To remove the mask, drag it out of the image, and the background will automatically
be filled. Alternatively, the mask can be moved to a different location. To replace the mask with
a new object, provide a text prompt for the mask.
(4)Grounded Editing: Users can directly place new objects on the image by drawing bounding
boxes and associating the corresponding concepts with the intended objects.
(5)Multi-turn Interaction: By repeating Steps 2, 3, or 4, users can iteratively refine their visual
creations.
Capability Comparisons Based on LLaV A that allows image input for visual chat only, LLaV A-
Interactive extends the capabilities to support visual interaction such as user-drawn strokes and
bounding boxes, as well as visual image generation/editing. Please see the comparisons of the
capabilities below:
3.1 Behind the Scenes: Individual Models
LLaV A-Interactive is an all-in-one demo that connects three LV models in one interactive session for
image chat, segmentation and generation/editing, which can complete more complex tasks than a
single model alone. As a background, we briefly describe the individual models for those who are
interested in the key techniques:

•LLaV A [13]: Large Language and Vision Assistant, the first open-source alternative to GPT-4V .
It is an end-to-end trained large multimodal model that combines CLIP vision encoder and
Vicuna for general-purpose visual understanding and reasoning, achieving impressive chat
capabilities mimicking the spirits of the GPT-4V . The recent LLaV A-1.5 [ 12] is considered in
LLaV A-Interactive.
•SEEM [31]: Segment Everything Everywhere with Multi-modal prompts all at once. SEEM
allows users to easily segment an image using prompts of different types including visual
prompts (points, marks, boxes, scribbles) and language prompts. It can also work with any
combination of prompts or generalize to custom prompts.
•GLIGEN [11]: Grounded-Language-to-Image Generation, an open-source model that extends
the functionality of existing pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models by enabling them to also
be conditioned on visual prompts such as bounding boxes.
3.2 Development Challenges
LLaV A-Interactive is a system-level demo synergy. It showcases the ability to create general-purpose
assistants/agents by leveraging existing model checkpoints, eliminating the need for additional
model training. While the training requirements for AI models are minimal, the development of
LLaV A-Interactive presented various technical challenges that we addressed along the way. Firstly,
we encountered difficulties with the GLIGEN inpainting model, which lacked the capability to fill
background holes. As a solution, we incorporated the use of LaMA [ 22] for background filling.
Secondly, Gradio, the framework used, lacked comprehensive support for user interaction, such
as drag-and-drop functionality. To overcome this, we developed a new Gradio Image component
tool that enabled the desired interaction. Additionally, integrating multiple complex projects and
models posed a complexity challenge, which we addressed through experimentation, a streamlined
UI layout, and an efficient data sharing scheme. Lastly, managing different package requirements and
dependencies proved challenging, leading us to run separate web services for different models, such
as LaMA.
4 Case Study: Multimodal Interactive Creation for Photographic Artists
To illustrate the enhanced user interaction experience and application scenarios made possible by
LLaV A-Interactive, we present a case study focused on its utilization as a general-purpose assistant for
photographic artists. Figure 3 showcases a multi-turn multimodal interactive image editing process.
The left side of the figure displays the interaction type and functionality for each turn, while the right
side provides a detailed depiction of the interaction process. The language-based dialogue between
the user and assistant is presented as text, with the user’s visual prompts shown in magenta text and
the resulting image editing outcomes displayed as processed images.
We describe the interaction process for this case study in Figure 3, which can be used as an example
for the presentation of more application scenarios in Section 5.
1A user first uploads a lake scenery image, and asks for suggestions to improve the visual
appearance. The assistant suggests to remove the wooden pier extending out into the water.
2Following the suggestions, the user turns to the
 
Remove and Change Object tab, chooses the  Stroke mode, draws a stroke on the pier of the image, and clicks
 
Segment . The segmentation
mask of the pier is shown, presented in magenta color in this example. The user can further
drag the mask out of the image, and click Generate , after which an updated image of the clear
lake without the pier is shown.

--- PAGE 6 ---
Assistant : The  part  of the picture  that  might  not be visually  appealing  to the viewer  is the wooden  pier  
extending  out into  the water . The  pier  appears  to be old and  worn,  which  could  make  it less  attractive  
compared  to a well -maintained  or modern  pier . Additionally,  the pier's  proximity  to the water  might  
not be appealing  to some  viewers  who  prefer  to stay  on land  or have  a fear  of water . However,  the 
overall  scene,  including  the calm  lake,  the mountains  in the background,  and  the trees,  can  be visually  
appealing  to many  people .User : What  part  of the picture  isn't  visually  appealing  to the viewer?
User : [Stroke on the pier]
 Assistant:
 User : [Drag the mask  to remove] [ Generate]
User :  Now, what part of the picture isn't visually appealing to the viewer?
Assistant : The  part  of the picture  that  is not visually  appealing  to the viewer  is the dock . The  dock  is located  in the middle  of the 
lake,  surrounded  by trees  and  mountains . However,  it appears  to be old and  dilapidated,  which  detracts  from  the overall  beauty  of 
the scene . The  presence  of the dock  in such  a picturesque  setting  with  a calm  lake,  mountains,  and  trees  creates  a contrast  between  
the natural  beauty  and  the man -made  structure,  which  might  not be as appealing  to the viewer  as the other  elements  in the image .
User : [Referral text = Dock] [Segment]User : [Drag the mask  to remove] [Generate]
Assistant : To improve  the visual  appeal  of the picture,  you  can  consider  adding  more  elements  to create  a sense  of depth  and  
balance . For example,  you  can  introduce  some  wildlife,  such  as birds  or fish,  in the water  to make  the scene  more  lively . 
Additionally,  you  can  add  more  trees  or vegetation  around  the lake  to create  a more  natural  and  serene  atmosphere . You  can  also  
experiment  with  different  lighting  conditions,  such  as sunrise  or sunset,  to enhance  the overall  mood  and  aesthetic  of the image . 
Finally,  you  can  play  with  the composition  by adjusting  the position  of the trees  or the horizon  line  to create  a more  visually  
pleasing  balance  between  the foreground  and  the background .User : I removed  the dock . What  else  can  I do to improve  the visual  appeal  of the picture?
Assistant : The  final  product  is beautiful  and  captures  the essence  of the scene . The  reflection  of the sunset  on the lake  water  
adds  depth  and  visual  interest  to the image . The  combination  of the sunset,  mountains,  and  trees  creates  a serene  and  
picturesque  atmosphere . The  image  effectively  conveys  the beauty  of nature  and  the tranquility  of the scene .User : [Referral text = Sky] [Segment] User : [Grounding text = sunset scene]
Assistant : Reflections  on the water  refer  to the light  from  the sunset  that  is reflected  off the surface  of the lake . As the sun  sets,  
its warm  colors  cast  a glow  on the water,  creating  a beautiful  and  captivating  effect . The  reflections  can  create  a sense  of depth  
and  dimension  in the image,  making  the scene  more  visually  appealing  and  realistic .User : I really like the idea of a sunset and changed the sky to a sunset scene. Does it look good to you?
Assistant : As an AI, I don't  have  personal  preferences  or opinions,  but I can  tell you  that  the image  you  have  created  with  the 
sunset  sky looks  visually  appealing . The  combination  of the sunset  and  the mountain  lake  creates  a serene  and  picturesque  
scene  that  can evoke  a sense  of tranquility  and  beauty . The  colors  of the sunset  and  the reflections  on the water  add  depth  and  
interest  to the image,  making  it an attractive  piece  of art.
User : What  do you  mean  by the reflections  on the water?
User : [Referral text = lake surface] [Segment] User : [Grounding text = reflection of the sunset scene in the sky] [Generate]
User : Thank  you  for mentioning  the reflection . I added  the reflection  of the sunset . What  do you  think  of my final  product?Visual Chat

3Based on the updated image, the user asks for further suggestions to improve the visual
appearance. The assistant suggests to remove the small dock in the middle of the lake.
4Following the suggestions, the user turns to the
 
Remove and Change Object tab again.
This time, the user utilizes the text prompt mode to segment the object, by choosing  Text ,
typing the “dock” in the
 
Enter referring text box, and clicking the
 
Segment button. The
segmentation mask of the dock is shown, presented in magenta color. Following the same
drag-and-generate procedure, the highlighted dock is removed from the image.
5The user seeks further suggestions to improve the visual appeal of the picture, and the assistant
recommends several concrete options, among which adding a sunset to enhance the overall
aesthetic of the image is mentioned.
6The user utilizes the text prompt mode again to select the sky region. To re-
place the selected mask with a new object, the user puts “sunset scene” in
 
Enter grounding text for generating a new image box, and click  Generate . A
new image with a sunset in the sky is shown.
7The user asks for further editing suggestions, and finds that the reflection of the sunset on the
water can make the image more appealing and realistic.
8By performing a similar text prompt based segmentation and replacement procedure on the
water, the reflection of the sunset scene in the sky is shown on the lake of the image.
9The user asks for comments on the final product. The assistant considers this final version can
effectively convey the beauty of nature.
5 Preliminary Evaluation with More Application Scenarios
5.1 Iterative Co-Creation of Visual Scene and Description
Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 4 and 5. Joint creation of a visual scene and its
associated text from scratch can be useful for content creators. In this scenario, the user can generate a
peaceful and relaxing outdoor scene from text, and specify spatial layout by drawing boxes. Once the
image is generated, the users can ask the assistant to describe and promote the image using text. The
visual image creation in one shot can be imperfect, and can be iteratively improved, e.g., removing
the gray shore and adding a white goose using a visual prompt in this example. For the final image,
the user can ask the assistant to produce a poem in both English and Chinese to promote the image.
If necessary, the user can also ask if the synthsized image is reasonable or not, e.g., the size of the
swan compared with the boat. It can be seen the text description and response of LLaV A-Interactive
is often coherent with edited images.
5.2 Graphic Design for a Halloween Poster
Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 6, 7 and 8. Designing visually appealing posters
and gift cards for occasions like Halloween demands imaginative concepts and striking aesthetics.
For instance, when crafting a Halloween poster, the user may request the AI assistant to offer a range
of ideas, and then choose one to be transformed into an image. To refine the generated image, the
user may seek further suggestions, such as incorporating a bat, swapping the scarecrow with a ghost,
removing a smaller scarecrow, adding a skeleton, and substituting pumpkins with a spider web. After
making these adjustments, the user can request feedback, and the assistant affirms that the design
effectively captures the spirit of Halloween.
5.3 Fashion Design for Kid’s Clothing
Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 9 and 10. Imagine one day when a user sees his
Chinese nephew’s sweatshirt with designed English text and a picture on the back, and wants to
personalize the design while the sweatshirt is being worn. To first show his nephew what is written
on the sweatshirt and the meaning of the text. The user asks the related questions, and the assistant is
able to correctly answer both. This simple application can be widely used to recognize text on various
clothes on the Chinese market, where most users have less knowledge about designed English text.
7

--- PAGE 8 ---
With LLaV A-Interactive, the user can further edit the picture by following his nephew’s personalized
requests to add a blue hat and sun glasses. The assistant can make comments on the new picture,
saying that “ the design features a cartoon bear wearing sunglasses and a hat, which could be appealing
to children who enjoy animals or have a sense of humor.” This encouraging comment can boost the
kid’s confidence in his design skills.
The assistant also mentions the city “Denver” in the comments, which the assistant guesses that it
could be the child’s hometown or a place they enjoy visiting. Following the comments, the user
wants to design a new picture with a representative natural scene of Denver. To this end, the user
first removes the bear and only leaves the background; after that, the user creates a new scene by
specifying the spatial layout of objects “lake; boat; tent; snow mountains”. With the new image,
the assistant believes that it is a great choice for a kid’s clothing, as it combines both aesthetics and
imagination.
5.4 Food Preparation
Dinner Preparation for a Romantic Date Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 11.
Individuals often enjoy capturing photos of appetizing meals they consume. When planning a
romantic dinner, individuals typically dedicate time and consideration to crafting the perfect dish,
complemented by wine and flowers. Nonetheless, they may still feel apprehensive about whether the
dinner is adequately prepared or if any enhancements could be made.
In this situation, we suggest utilizing LLaV A-Interactive to obtain valuable advice and recommenda-
tions. The assistant expresses enthusiasm about the dinner while also offering specific ideas, such as
incorporating salads to enhance the main dishes and using candles to establish a warm and intimate
ambiance. By implementing these suggestions, the user can modify the image to develop various
virtual dinner options and submit them to the assistant for evaluation. Once the ideal solution is
determined and receives positive feedback from the assistant, the user can also request guidance on
appropriate dating etiquette for this specific dinner.
Food Preparation Recipe Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 12 and 13. In another
example involving meal preparation using available ingredients, the user may inquire about the
necessary ingredients and cooking instructions. The user might also decide to change some elements,
such as replacing butter with rice. Upon asking the same question again, updated ingredients and
instruction lists will be provided with the revised cooking tips.
5.5 Visual Content Creation and Story Telling
Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 14. The process of visual storytelling usually de-
mands creativity and considerable time investment, as it involves the development of both compelling
images and imaginative text. Occasionally, adjustments to the visuals may be necessary to ensure they
are in harmony with the overall scene. In Figure 14, LLaV A-Interactive is able to provide detailed
descriptions and a magical story for kids.
The user may ask for possible edits on the image for a more whimsical story. Several more playful
and imaginative elements are suggested, including glowing mushrooms and oversize instruments. By
following the idea, the user inpaints the new objects of intended spatial configuration in the image,
e.g., a growing mushroom in front of the first character on the left, and an oversize drum for the
fourth character who is playing a drum.
5.6 Education
Scientific Education. Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 15 and 16. In order to
engage children in learning scientific concepts, it is effective to present the information using visual
imagery and familiar themes, such as cartoon characters. For instance, a child living in the Seattle
area may be drawn to an image featuring the Space Needle and a dinosaur set against a pink sky,
creating a lively scene. Such an image would capture the child’s interest due to its recognizable
elements. The child might then inquire about the T-rex, the reason behind the pink sky, the color of
the sky during midday, and why it changes. Additionally, the T-rex could be replaced with various
8

--- PAGE 9 ---
robots, prompting the child to ask about their functions and concepts. By using familiar and visually
appealing elements, learning about science can become an enjoyable experience for children.
Cartoon Reading Education. Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 17. To improve
one’s ability to interpret cartoons, it is crucial to understand that different details within an image can
communicate various meanings. For example, when examining an editorial cartoon featuring a man
wearing clothing labeled "PRESS" and bound by a ball and chain, the assistant might explain that the
image metaphorically represents the obstacles journalists encounter in their quest for truth and the
significance of safeguarding their freedom of expression. However, if the "PRESS" label is removed
and the same question is asked, the responses could vary greatly. The cartoon may still convey a
strong visual message about the challenges and pressures the man faces, but the interpretations can
differ considerably without the context provided by the "PRESS" label.
5.7 Interior Design
Interior Design: Large Living Room. Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 18 and 19.
Interior design can be progressively enhanced through a trial-and-error process. Initially, the user
creates an image based on a text description prompt and seeks advice on how to modernize the
design. Suggestions might include incorporating minimalist elements, adopting contemporary styles,
adding potted plants, and displaying modern art on the walls. The user can then modify the design by
segmenting objects and making adjustments using stroke and text prompts. As a result, these new
elements come together to create a more comfortable and updated living room design.
Interior Design: Small Living Room. Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 20 and
21. In a different living room design scenario, the assistant offers an extensive list of improvements.
The user utilizes the interactive segmentation ability of the AI to select the sofa and table, updating
them to a modern style. Additionally, a potted plant is incorporated using the grounded inpainting
skill. The user might also inquire about specific objects, such as the position of the TV or replacing
the ceiling lamp. Based on the suggestions, these objects can be modified using segmentation and
inpainting skills to achieve the desired outcome.
5.8 Identification of Unusual and Risky Items
Please see the user-assistant interaction in Figure 22. It is an important aspect of safety and security
to detect the unusual, abnormal and risky items in images. The process typically involves analyzing
images to detect any objects or patterns that may pose a risk or deviate from the norm. We use the
popular extreme ironing image as an example to illustrate this use scenario. A typical question is to
report what is unusual in the image. We further ask about the potential dangers. LLaV A-Interactive is
able to correctly respond to this due to the use of the underlying LLaV A model. The image appears to
be unusual because of the co-existence of the moving car and the man doing ironing. We ablate this
by removing one element at each time. By removing the person, the ironing activity is not reported.
Instead, the presentation of a chair on a moving car becomes the key unusual element. By replacing
the moving taxi with flowers, the moving car is not reported. Instead, the assistant perceives the
unusual aspect as that the man is riding a bicycle that is carrying a large, colorful bouquet of flowers.
This is possible as the riding bicycle might be hiding behind the flowers. This analysis-by-synthesis
approach can be effective in examining visual scenes to identify anomalies.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we have introduced LLaV A-Interactive, a research demo prototype that showcases
the practical applications of large multimodal models featuring visual input, output, and interaction.
LLaV A-Interactive is cost-effective in system development since it combines three pre-trained
multimodal models of complementary skills using web services, without requiring additional model
training: LLaV A for visual chat, SEEM for interactive image segmentation, and GLIGEN for
grounded image generation and editing. At the system level, compared with other systems, LLaV A-
Interactive is a fully vision-language multimodal system in terms of input, output, and interaction,
particularly unique in supporting visual prompts for image segmentation and generation/editing. Our
initial assessment of LLaV A-Interactive across a wide range of real-world application scenarios has
9

--- PAGE 10 ---
demonstrated its excellent ability to perform new, complex tasks. We hope this will inspire further
research into multimodal foundation models.
We identify several potential avenues for future research: (i)The abilities of LLaV A-Interactive are re-
stricted by the performance limits of the utilized pre-trained models. Enhancing LLaV A-Interactive’s
specific skill could be achieved by replacing the module with a superior model variant or creating
an improved individual model, such as LLaV A, SEEM, and GLIGEN. System development and
individual model development can be de-coupled, allowing for a plug-and-play approach to system
serving. We also hope to extend the system development framework by incorporating additional
features like Instruct Pix2Pix [ 1] for image-level editing. (ii)Since LLaV A-Interactive is a composite
of individual models, its capacity during each inference is determined by the existing abilities of those
models. While more complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative activation of current skills
for combined skills, no new skill emerges at each inference by interpolating in the neural network’s
hidden space. We encourage the community to develop multimodal foundation models with more
unified modeling, allowing new capabilities to emerge through latent task composition.

Visual Content Creation and Story Telling
User can you describe the image?
Assistant The image features a group of five cartoon characters, each dressed as a different type of tree,
playing musical instruments in a forest setting. They are positioned in a line, with one character on
the left, two in the middle, and two on the right side of the scene. The characters are playing various
instruments, including a violin, a guitar, and a banjo.
The forest setting is enhanced by the presence of trees in the background, with one large tree on the
left side and another on the right side of the image. The scene appears to be a lively and whimsical
representation of a musical performance in a natural environment.
User please write a story based on the image?
Assistant Once upon a time, in a magical forest, a group of five tree-themed characters gathered to perform a
musical concert. Each character was dressed in a unique costume representing their respective tree
species, and they played various musical instruments with great enthusiasm.
The first character, a tall and slender tree, played the violin with grace and precision. The second
character, a sturdy and broad tree, strummed the guitar with a powerful and rhythmic beat. The third
character, a delicate and elegant tree, skillfully plucked the banjo, adding a touch of melody to the
performance. The fourth character, a small and twisted tree, played the drums with a lively and
energetic flair. Lastly, the fifth character, a short and bushy tree, danced and sang, captivating the
audience with their charming presence.
As the concert progressed, the forest came alive with the music, and the audience of animals and
fairies gathered around to enjoy the performance. The moon, which was full and bright, illuminated
the scene, casting a warm and magical glow over the entire forest.
The concert was a great success, and the tree-themed characters became known as the most talented
and entertaining musicians in the land. They continued to perform together, spreading joy and
happiness through their music, and the forest became a place of wonder and enchantment for all
who visited.
User if necessary, please provide suggestion to edit the image for a more whimsical story?
Assistant To make the image more whimsical, one could consider adding more playful and imaginative
elements to the scene. For example, the characters could be posed in a more exaggerated and
humorous manner, with oversized instruments or exaggerated facial expressions. The forest setting
could be further enhanced by adding more colorful and fantastical elements, such as glowing
mushrooms, sparkling flowers, or even a magical waterfall.
Additionally, the characters could be interacting with each other in a more playful and lighthearted
manner, such as dancing, laughing, or even engaging in a friendly competition to see who can play
the best instrument. The overall atmosphere of the image could be further enhanced by adding
more whimsical details, such as a flying bird or a playful squirrel, to create a more imaginative and
delightful scene.

Assistant
User Can you tell me what is in this picture?
Assistant The image features a large green dinosaur statue standing next to a tall tower, possibly the Space
Needle. The dinosaur appears to be a T-Rex, and it is positioned in front of the tower, creating
an interesting contrast between the two structures. The scene is set against a backdrop of a pink
sky, adding a unique and vibrant atmosphere to the image.
User What is a T-rex?
Assistant A T-Rex, short for Tyrannosaurus Rex, is a large carnivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late
Cretaceous period, around 68 to 65 million years ago. It is one of the most well-known and
iconic dinosaurs due to its massive size, powerful jaws, and distinctive appearance. T-Rex had
a small head, large eyes, and a long, sturdy tail. It was a dominant predator in its ecosystem,
feeding on a variety of prey, including other dinosaurs, such as Triceratops and Edmontosaurus.
T-Rex is often depicted in popular culture, including movies, television shows, and video games,
as a fearsome and relentless predator. However, in reality, it is believed that T-Rex had a
relatively slow and lumbering gait, and it may have been more of a scavenger than an active
hunter. Despite its fearsome reputation, T-Rex was not the largest land predator that ever existed;
that title belongs to the Spinosaurus, a dinosaur from the same time period.
User Why is the sky pink?
Assistant The sky is pink due to the presence of clouds in the atmosphere, which are reflecting the sunlight.
This phenomenon occurs when sunlight passes through the Earth’s atmosphere and interacts
with the molecules in the air, causing them to scatter the light. The scattering process is more
pronounced for shorter wavelengths, such as blue and violet, than for longer wavelengths, like
red and orange. As a result, the sky appears pink during sunset or sunrise, when the sun is low
in the sky and the light has to travel through more of the Earth’s atmosphere.
User If I want this picture to represent midday, not during sunset or sunrise, what color should the
sky be?
Assistant If you want the picture to represent midday, the sky should be blue. During midday, the sun
is at its highest point in the sky, and the light has to travel through the least amount of the
Earth’s atmosphere. This results in the scattering of shorter wavelengths, such as blue and violet,
being less pronounced, allowing the longer wavelengths, like red and orange, to dominate the
sky’s color. In this case, the sky would appear blue, providing a more natural and accurate
representation of the time of day.

User I want to replace the dinosaur with something else. Any suggestions?
Assistant Certainly! If you would like to replace the dinosaur with something else, you could consider
the following options: 1. A giant robot or mech: This could be a futuristic or retro-inspired
design, adding a sense of wonder and excitement to the scene. 2. A massive sculpture of a
famous historical figure: This could be a person from history, mythology, or even a fictional
character, such as a superhero or a popular movie character. 3. A giant, intricate artwork or
mural: This could be a colorful, abstract, or representational piece that adds visual interest
and artistic flair to the area. 4. A large, interactive exhibit or installation: This could be an
immersive experience that engages visitors, such as a virtual reality exhibit, an interactive art
piece, or a themed playground. Ultimately, the choice of replacing the dinosaur with something
else depends on the context, the desired atmosphere, and the preferences of the local community
or visitors.

Education: Cartoon Reading.
User
User What does this editorial cartoon mean?
Assistant The editorial cartoon depicts a man in a suit, who appears to be a reporter or a news anchor,
being tied up with a ball and chain. This image symbolizes the idea of being restricted or
limited in one’s freedom of expression or movement, possibly due to censorship or other forms
of control. The man’s profession as a reporter or news anchor suggests that the cartoon might
be commenting on the challenges faced by journalists in certain situations, where they may be
subjected to restrictions or limitations on their ability to report the news freely and accurately.
The image serves as a metaphor for the challenges faced by journalists in their pursuit of truth
and the importance of protecting their freedom of expression.

User What does this editorial cartoon mean?
Assistant The editorial cartoon features a man in a suit and tie, who is being pulled by a giant rubber band.
The rubber band is attached to the man’s waist, and it appears to be stretched to its limit. The
image is a black and white drawing, which adds to the dramatic effect of the scene.The meaning
of this editorial cartoon could be interpreted in various ways, depending on the context in which
it was created. It could symbolize the challenges or burdens that the man might be facing, such
as financial or professional responsibilities. The rubber band could represent the pressure or
stress that the man is experiencing, and the fact that it is stretched to its limit might indicate that
he is struggling to cope with these challenges. Alternatively, the image could also be interpreted
as a humorous representation of the man’s size or the consequences of overeating. The cartoon
might be commenting on the man’s weight or the societal expectations of professionalism and
appearance. In any case, the cartoon is a powerful visual representation of the challenges and
pressures that the man might be facing, and it encourages the viewer to reflect on the underlying
message and its relevance to their own experiences or the broader context in which the cartoon
was created.

Assistant
User What do you think about this room. How could I improve it to make it more modern?
Assistant The room appears to be a cozy living room with a couch, a coffee table, a TV , and a potted
plant. To make it more modern, you could consider updating the furniture and decor to reflect
contemporary styles. For example, you could replace the couch and coffee table with sleek,
minimalist designs, and add a stylish rug to the floor. Additionally, you could update the TV
to a slim, flat-screen model and consider adding some modern artwork or decorative items on
the walls. To enhance the room’s ambiance, you could also introduce more potted plants or
greenery, and consider using a combination of neutral and warm colors for the walls, curtains,
and other textiles. Finally, adding some ambient lighting, such as floor lamps or table lamps,
can create a more inviting and modern atmosphere in the living room.

User I’ve changed some furniture in the room. Do you think it is good idea to lower the TV?
Assistant Yes, lowering the TV in the living room is a good idea. In the image, the TV is currently
mounted on the wall at a higher position. Lowering the TV to a more comfortable viewing
height can improve the overall viewing experience for the people in the room. This can help
reduce strain on the neck and eyes, especially when watching the TV from the couch or other
seating areas. Additionally, lowering the TV can make it easier for people to see the screen,
especially if they are sitting at a lower angle or distance from the TV .

Identification of Unusual and Risky Items.
User
User what is unusual about this image? is it dangerous?
Assistant The unusual aspect of this image is that a man is ironing clothes while standing on the back of a
moving car. This is dangerous because ironing clothes typically requires a stable surface and
proper safety measures, such as using an ironing board and wearing appropriate protective gear.
Standing on the back of a moving car is not only unstable but also poses a significant risk to the
man’s safety, as he could lose his balance and fall off the car, potentially causing severe injuries.
Additionally, the man’s actions could distract the driver, increasing the risk of an accident.

User what is unusual about this image? is it dangerous?
Assistant The unusual aspect of this image is that a yellow SUV is driving down the street with a chair
strapped to its roof. This is not a typical sight, as it is not common for people to transport
furniture, such as chairs, on the roof of their vehicles while driving. The situation could be
potentially dangerous, as the chair might not be securely fastened, and it could fall off the
vehicle while in motion, causing accidents or damage to the chair and other vehicles on the road.
Additionally, the driver’s visibility might be obstructed by the chair, making it difficult to see
other vehicles or pedestrians, which could also lead to accidents.

User what is unusual about this image? is it dangerous?
Assistant The unusual aspect of this image is the man riding a bicycle that is carrying a large, colorful
floral arrangement, which appears to be a giant bouquet of flowers. This is not a common sight,
as people typically do not transport such large and heavy objects on bicycles. The man is also
wearing a yellow shirt, which adds to the uniqueness of the scene. The presence of a car in the
background further emphasizes the contrast between the man’s bicycle and the typical mode of
transportation seen on the street. The combination of the man’s attire, the bicycle, and the giant
bouquet of flowers creates an interesting and eye-catching image.
