## Most Duplicated Papers

| arXiv ID | Copies | Title | Collections |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 2211.11559 | 11 | Visual Programming: Compositional visual reasoning without training | agent, coding, continual-learning, image-editing, modular, multimodal, question-answering, rag, reasoning, root, shared-params |
| 2309.11436 | 9 | You Only Look at Screens: Multimodal Chain-of-Action Agents | agent, cot, instruct, layout, multimodal, planning, rag, reasoning, root |
| 2309.13075 | 8 | (Math/Reasoning paper) | agent, coding, cot, icl, math, planning, reasoning, rl-alignment |
| 2305.18169 | 8 | (PEFT/Training paper) | context-compression, continual-learning, contrastive, data-augmentation, dataset-generation, paraphrase, peft, prompt |

## Collection Overlap Patterns

**Most Common Collection Pairs** (papers appearing in both):

1. **agent ↔ reasoning**: 24 papers
2. **cot ↔ reasoning**: 24 papers  
3. **planning ↔ reasoning**: 19 papers
4. **rag ↔ reasoning**: 18 papers
5. **agent ↔ planning**: 15 papers
6. **agent ↔ cot**: 14 papers
7. **cot ↔ planning**: 14 papers
8. **audio ↔ speech**: 14 papers
9. **agent ↔ rag**: 13 papers
10. **icl ↔ reasoning**: 13 papers

## Key Insights

### High Overlap Areas
- **AI Agents**: Heavy overlap between agent, reasoning, planning, cot, and rag collections
- **Audio/Speech**: Natural overlap between audio, speech, and multimodal collections  
- **Reasoning**: Central hub collection that overlaps with many specialized areas
- **Training Methods**: PEFT, continual-learning, and related training approaches share many papers

### Natural Categorization Challenges
- Many papers genuinely belong to multiple research areas
- Cross-disciplinary papers (e.g., multimodal agents) naturally appear in multiple collections
- Foundational papers appear across many specialized collections

### Deduplication Opportunity
- **52% reduction possible** by removing duplicates
- Could reduce from 4,547 to ~2,181 unique papers
- Largest gains from consolidating agent/reasoning overlap

## Recommendations

1. **Consider Collection Merging**: 
   - Merge highly overlapping collections (agent/reasoning/planning)
   - Create hierarchy with base + specialized collections

2. **Implement Deduplication**:
   - Remove duplicate entries while preserving topic coverage
   - Maintain cross-references between related collections

3. **Collection Refinement**:
   - Define clearer boundaries between collections
   - Consider primary vs secondary categorization system

4. **Metadata Enhancement**:
   - Track which collections each paper belongs to
   - Enable search across related collections
