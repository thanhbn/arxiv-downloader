ABSTRACT
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are tiny in comparison to the galaxies they inhabit, yet they
manage to influence and coevolve along with their hosts. Evidence of this mutual development is
observed in the structure and dynamics of galaxies and their correlations with black hole mass ( M•).
For our study, we focus on relative parameters that are unique to only disk galaxies. As such, we
quantify the structure of spiral galaxies via their logarithmic spiral-arm pitch angles ( ϕ) and their
dynamics through the maximum rotational velocities of their galactic disks ( vmax). In the past, we
have studied black hole mass scaling relations between M•andϕorvmax, separately. Now, we combine
the three parameters into a trivariate M•–ϕ–vmaxrelationship that yields best-in-class accuracy in
prediction of black hole masses in spiral galaxies. Because most black hole mass scaling relations
have been created from samples of the largest SMBHs within the most massive galaxies, they lack
certainty when extrapolated to low-mass spiral galaxies. Thus, it is difficult to confidently use existing
scaling relations when trying to identify galaxies that might harbor the elusive class of intermediate-
mass black holes (IMBHs). Therefore, we offer our novel relationship as an ideal predictor to search
for IMBHs and probe the low-mass end of the black hole mass function by utilizing spiral galaxies.
Already with rotational velocities widely available for a large population of galaxies and pitch angles
readily measurable from uncalibrated images, we expect that the M•–ϕ–vmaxfundamental plane will
be a useful tool for estimating black hole masses, even at high redshifts.

1.INTRODUCTION
Black hole mass scaling relations ( i.e., relations with
central black hole mass as the dependent variable and
some physical property of its host galaxy as the in-
dependent variable) have evolved and proliferated over
the past quarter-century, beginning with the identifica-
tion of a correlation between black hole mass ( M•) and
the stellar mass of its host galaxy’s bulge (Magorrian
et al. 1998). The most reliable of these scaling rela-
tions are those that are built and calibrated upon sam-
ples of galaxies with dynamically-measured black hole

have been directly measured in just the nearest and most
massive galaxies.2With SMBHs expected to reside in
the hearts of most every massive galaxy (Rees 1984),

that host directly-measured black holes and galaxies from the
general population (Shankar et al. 2016) have been quashed (Sahu
et al. 2023).

one can take their pick of scaling relations (see Graham
2016; D’Onofrio et al. 2021, for informative reviews) to
perform black hole mass estimates for large numbers of
galaxies in surveys to construct black hole mass func-
tions ( e.g., Graham et al. 2007; Davis et al. 2014; Mutlu-
Pakdil et al. 2016).
The accuracy of scaling relations can vary significantly
based on which independent variable is selected; some
variables are less accurate or not applicable for cer-
tain galaxy morphologies ( e.g., bulge relations are use-
less for bulgeless galaxies). Moreover, the prevalence of
morphologically-dependent black hole mass scaling rela-
tions ( e.g., Davis et al. 2018, 2019b; Sahu et al. 2019a)
hints that particular independent variables alone might
not be sufficient to cover different galaxy morphologies.
Specifically, this is evident from the different coefficients
required for the same variables when applied to separate
morphologies in isolation. As such, it is problematic to
be restricted to using only one predictor of black hole
mass. Thus, we seek a methodology that incorporates
multiple mass predictors in one relation.
Dynamical measurements of smaller black holes like
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are much more
difficult to obtain because the gravitational sphere of
influence radius of a black hole is directly proportional
to the mass of the black hole. As expected, an ob-
servational bias exists among the catalog of directly-
measured black holes, i.e., only black holes that are suffi-
ciently massive and/or nearby are measurable (Batchel-
dor 2010). Our current sample of 145 dynamically-
measured black holes ranges from 4 ×105M⊙≲M•≲
2×1010M⊙(Jin & Davis 2023). Although this sam-
ple reaches down almost to the IMBH regime (103≤
M•<105M⊙), the sample of black holes is very top
heavy with a median mass of ≈108M⊙. Therefore, in-
terpolation of existing black hole mass scaling relations
are incapable of predicting IMBHs and extrapolation is
heavily reliant on the largest SMBHs. As such, several
studies have instead relied on meta-analyses to combine
the predictions of multiple black hole mass scaling rela-
tions to more securely extrapolate down into the IMBH
regime (Koliopanos et al. 2017; Graham & Soria 2019;
Graham et al. 2019; Davis & Graham 2021; Davis et al.
2023).
In a larger study (Jin & Davis 2023), we used
modern machine learning methods to identify higher-
dimensional ( n-D) black hole mass scaling relations
that have lower intrinsic scatters than existing two-
dimensional (2-D) black hole mass scaling relations.
With 145 galaxies and as much as a hundred different
measured quantities for every galaxy, the task of check-
ing the vast number of permutations of possible n-Dblack hole mass scaling relations is an immense under-
taking. Therefore, we applied modern machine learning
methods to find the best scaling relations, which ideally
are an optimized combination of accuracy and simplic-
ity. For this task, we ran symbolic regression software
PySR (Cranmer 2023) to find the best combination of
variables and mathematical operations to describe our
dataset of directly-measured SMBH masses and their
host galaxy parameters.
In this letter, we describe in detail one such solution
found by of our study: a trivariate relationship between
M•, logarithmic spiral-arm pitch angle ( ϕ), and max-
imum rotational velocity ( vmax). We will present our
sample, fit, and analysis of the planar black hole mass
scaling relation in §2. In §3, we will discuss benefits,
reasons, comparisons, implications, and utility of our
M•–ϕ–vmaxfundamental plane. Finally, we provide a
summary of our findings and remark on future work (in
§4). We represent black hole masses ( M•) throughout
this work as logarithmic (solar) masses ( M•), such that
M•≡log(M•/M⊙). All uncertainties are quoted at
1σ≡68.3% confidence intervals; median absolute devi-
ations are given as uncertainties associated with medi-
ans.
2.DATA AND ANALYSIS
2.1. Sample
Our sample consists of all spiral galaxies with M•,ϕ,
andvmaxmeasurements from Davis et al. (2019c). This
yields a set of 41 galaxies (not including the Milky Way),
all with dynamically-measured black hole masses (see
references compiled by Davis et al. 2017, 2019b). Pitch
angles were consistently measured by Davis et al. (2017,
2019c)3and rotational velocities compiled by Davis et al.
(2019c, see references therein). This sample that we use
to construct the planar relation is listed in Table 1.

Note — This sample of 41 spiral galaxies (not including
the Milky Way) consists of all spiral galaxies with ϕ,
vmax, and M•measurements from our larger sample of
all galaxy types. The full parent dataset of 145 galaxies

∗We do not include the Milky Way in our preferred de-
termination of the fundamental plane (see §A for further
details).
The sample of SMBH host galaxies exhibits a broad
range in each of the three variables. To illustrate this,
we have plotted probability density functions (PDFs) of
each parameter in Figure 1. From these distributions,
we normalize the ϕandvmaxvalues about their respec-
tive medians to minimize the covariance between the
estimated coefficients during regression analysis. Fol-
lowing an initial symbolic regression, we then use the
outputs from PySR (Cranmer 2023) as our input initial
guesses for Hyper-Fit (Robotham & Obreschkow 2015,
2016).4

4The combination of PySR and Hyper-Fit is necessary to produce
a relation that considers and takes into account the errors on
individual measurements. PySR only considers the uncertainties
on the dependent variable ( i.e.,M•) without accounting for the
uncertainties on the independent variables ( i.e.,ϕandvmax),
and produces a best-fit relation without uncertainties on the de-
rived coefficients nor computing the intrinsic scatter of the rela-
tion. Whereas, Hyper-Fit is able to refine the fit found by PySR
while taking into account errors on every measurement, produc-
ing uncertainties on each derived coefficient, and determining the
intrinsic scatter of the plane.

tions of variables, operators, and constants, and judges
these equations with a score defined by both accuracy
and simplicity. In this work, we adopt the symbolic re-
gression package PySR (Cranmer 2023), which conducts
the equation search through a multi-population evolu-
tionary algorithm. The accuracy is defined by the mean
squared error loss, and the simplicity is characterized by
a complexity score, where each use of variables, opera-
tors, and constants adds some pre-defined complexity.
The final score of an equation aims to maximize the ac-
curacy and penalize the complexity with a parsimony
constant.
The variable pool that we input to PySR includes all
of the data from Davis et al. (2017, 2019c), parame-
ters modeled by the bulge/disk decompositions of Davis
et al. (2019b), and their derived spheroid stellar density
properties (Sahu et al. 2022b). These variables included,
but are not limited to: pitch angle, central stellar ve-
locity dispersion, maximum rotational velocity, galaxy
stellar mass, and several properties of the spheroid, in-
cluding S´ ersic index, half-light radius, stellar mass, and
densities (apparent, projected, and de-projected). We
also included all available measurements from Hyper-
Leda (Makarov et al. 2014), e.g., colors, diameters, etc.
The variable pool also included multiple copies of each
variable in different forms of natural numbers, their log-
arithms, and trigonometric functions ( e.g.,|ϕ|or tan |ϕ|
andvmaxor log vmax). The arithmetic operator pool is
simply +, −,×, and ÷, with additional log10, power,
and exponentiation in rare cases. Based upon a search
on these criteria, PySR found an optimal correlation be-
tween M•, tan|ϕ|, and log( vmax/km s−1). A presenta-
tion and discussion of other interesting scaling relations
found by PySR are beyond the intended scope of thisletter, they will be addressed in a more comprehensive
work (Jin & Davis 2023).
The functional form and initial parameters were iden-
tified by PySR and refined via Hyper-Fit . The final
fitted equation for the M•–ϕ–vmaxrelationship is

The orientation of the plane intuitively matches the ex-
pectation of the extreme cases:

ies with tightly wound spiral arms andhigh rota-

with loosely wound spiral arms andlowrotational

and

5Hyper-Fit minimizes the intrinsic scatter orthogonal to the plane
and then performs a transformation from normal to Cartesian
coordinates and outputs the intrinsic scatter along the axis of
the dependent variable.

galaxy types.6
2.3. Error Analysis
One sign of a robust multi-parameter relationship is
when different variables contribute equitably. That is,
one variable should not have an overly-dominant influ-
ence on the relationship. Therefore, we need to check
the relative change in M•when there is a proportional
change in ϕorvmax. To check this, we test Equation 1
with equivalent 10% variations in the median values of
ϕorvmax. Doing so, we find that a change of 10% in ϕ
leads to a 37.39% change in M•or a 10% change in vmax
leads to a 48.59% change in M•. Ergo, in terms of over-
all weight, vmaxaccounts for a slight majority (56.51%)
of the variation in M•as compared to a similarly-sized
variation in ϕ. Thus, neither variable has an outsized
influence on M•.
We used the Hyper-Fit routine to robustly fit the
equation of the plane to the ( ϕ,vmax,M•) variable
set, with consideration of the individual uncertainties on
all three parameters and accounting for intrinsic scatter
in the relation. As suggested by its name, Hyper-Fit
is uniquely designed to fit “linear models to multi-
dimensional data with multi-variate Gaussian uncertain-
ties.” Additionally, Hyper-Fit calculates the intrinsic
scatter of a scaling relation, which can be considered
as the root-mean-square deviation in the observed data
from the fitted function in the case of zero measurement
error.7Therefore, intrinsic scatter is the ideal parame-
ter to judge and compare the accuracy of various scaling
relations.
Our determination of a fundamental plane of black
hole mass in spiral galaxies is ultimately advantageous
because of its combination of the M•–ϕ(σ= 0.33±
0.08 dex) and M•–vmax(σ∼0.45 dex) relations, reduc-
ing the intrinsic scatter down to σ= 0.22±0.06 dex in
6In the symbolic regression analysis of the spiral galaxies in our
sample, we investigated and considered higher-dimensional ver-
sions of Equation 1 that incorporated additional quantities such
as colors and bulge-to-total ratios. However, none of our higher-
dimensional combinations improved upon the optimization of
Equation 1 with the added expense of increased complexity and
error propagation. We find the planar relation is valid because
it is built upon parameters ( ϕandvmax) that are unique to disk
galaxies. In our forthcoming work (Jin & Davis 2023), we will
present higher-dimensional relations that we were able to find
due to the larger combined sample of late-type and early-type
galaxies with their more varied ranges of colors, bulge-to-total
ratios, etc., as compared to our sample of just spiral galaxies in
the current work.
7For a more detailed description of intrinsic scatter and its deter-
mination in galaxy scaling relations, see Stone et al. (2021).theM•-direction. Previously, the M•–ϕrelation had
the lowest level of intrinsic scatter among black hole
mass scaling relations for spiral galaxies. This reduc-
tion down to σ= 0.22±0.06 dex (now below a factor
of log 2 ≈0.3 dex) with the planar relation significantly
improves upon the previous accuracy of the M•–ϕre-
lation, which was already well below intrinsic scatters
available for black hole mass scaling relations built from
samples of late- and early-type galaxies. With such a
low-level of intrinsic scatter, this makes the M•–ϕ–vmax
relation the preeminent scaling relation for black hole
mass in spiral galaxies.
3.DISCUSSION
3.1. The Benefit of Combining Two Relations
Because the M•–ϕ–vmaxrelation is a combination of
theM•–ϕandM•–vmaxrelations (see the bottom panels
of Figure 2 for projections of these relations), we begin
by comparing our 3-D relation to each of the 2-D rela-
tions (see Figure 3). First (in the left column of plots in
Figure 3), we compare the fundamental plane with the
M•–ϕrelation (Davis et al. 2017, equation 8). From a
glance, we find that both relations display tight correla-
tions without significant outliers. For a more complete
comparison, we have included subplots that break down
the performance of each relation versus the planar re-
lation across eight bins. One subplot shows root mean
square error (∆ rms) in each bin and the other subplot
shows the mean absolute scatter ( ¯∆) in each bin. As
we can see, the M•–ϕ–vmaxrelation generally equals or
outperforms the M•–ϕrelation in all except for the most
massive bin. Although, the planar relation does tend to
be biased towards slightly over-massive black holes in
the middle bins, as compared to the M•–ϕrelation.
Second (in the right column of plots in Figure 3), we
compare the fundamental plane with the M•–vmaxre-
lation (Davis et al. 2019c, equation 10). We can see
that the planar relation is significantly more accurate
than the M•–vmaxrelation in the four most massive
bins. Here, the plane is only slightly lopsided towards
over-massive black hole predictions in the central bins,
relative to the M•–vmaxrelation. Overall, these com-
parisons to each of the 2-D relations demonstrates that
the fundamental plane performs well, particularly so at
the low-mass end, which should make it advantageous
for extrapolating toward lower mass black holes, i.e.,
IMBHs.
3.2. Explanation of the Fundamental Plane
The existence of a tight M•–ϕ–vmaxrelation built
upon M•–ϕandM•–vmaxrelations is not a revelation,
but rather an expected consequence of numerous prior

Davis et al. (2019b) showed that |ϕ| ∝M⋆,sph.9It fol-
lows from these correlations that there should be a cor-
relation between ϕandM•(Seigar et al. 2008; Berrier
et al. 2013; Davis et al. 2017) as both are strongly cor-
related to bulge mass.
As for uncovering the M•–vmaxrelation, we can look
first at the correlation between vmaxandTidentified by
Roberts (1978). By substituting |ϕ|as a proxy for T,
we then arrive at the ϕ–vmaxrelation (Kennicutt 1981;
Davis et al. 2019c). Armed with the knowledge of both
ϕ–M•andϕ–vmaxrelations, Davis et al. (2019c) pro-
duced an M•–vmaxrelation that is informed by, and con-
sistent with, the Tully-Fisher relation (Tully & Fisher
9Theϕ–M⋆,sphrelation is actually a projection of the fundamental
plane of spiral structure in disk galaxies (Lin & Shu 1966; Davis
et al. 2015).1977; Tiley et al. 2019). Thus, we now arrive at a uni-
fiedM•–ϕ–vmaxrelation that is a manifestation of the
gravitational potential well of a spiral galaxy. Ergo, in
more massive galaxies with deeper potential wells, we
find more massive black holes, more tightly-wound spi-
ral patterns, and higher rotational velocities.
3.3. Fundamental Planes with Black Hole Mass
There have been a couple prior attempts at obtaining
a fundamental plane scaling relation for SMBHs. The
most relevant example is the trivariate relation between
M•–σe–Re, where Reis a galaxy’s half-light radius and
σeis the stellar velocity dispersion inside an aperture
equal to Re(Marconi & Hunt 2003; van den Bosch 2016).
For the M•–σe–Rerelation, van den Bosch (2016) found
an intrinsic scatter of σ= 0.49±0.03 dex in the M•-
direction. However, this is insignificant because van den
Bosch (2016) also found an identical intrinsic scatter for
theM•–σerelation, meaning that the addition of the
third parameter, Re, serves no purpose, and in prac-
tice makes things worse because it introduces another
variable that contributes to error propagation. More-
over, van den Bosch (2016) utilized a large sample of
230 black hole mass measurements that is “very het-

erogenous” because they are derived from a variety of
measurement methods, most of which are indirect and
not from dynamical methods.
The other notable example is the so-called fundamen-
tal plane of black hole activity (Merloni et al. 2003; Fal-
cke et al. 2004). This plane is one between M•–LR–LX,
where LRandLXare radio and X-ray luminosity, re-
spectively. The fundamental plane of black hole activity
is based upon the interpretation of scale invariant disk–
jet coupling manifesting as an empirical relation between
jet power probed by radio and mass accretion rate via
X-rays. In order to perceive the intrinsic disk–jet cou-
pling mechanism, this requires simultaneity of radio and
X-ray observations to account for the duty-cycle of ac-
tive galactic nuclei. However, given that the processes
that govern the M•–LR–LXrelation are highly-secular,
this leads to an intrinsic scatter of σ= 0.96±0.13 dex
in the M•-direction (G¨ ultekin et al. 2019), “indicating
a large amount of unexplained variance.” Additionally,
G¨ ultekin et al. (2022) caution against using the funda-
mental plane of black hole activity without additional
constraints beyond just straightforward X-ray and ra-
dio observations. All together, the noted problems with
either of the aforementioned planar relations further ce-
ments the M•–ϕ–vmaxrelation’s superiority as a best-in-
class black hole mass scaling relation for spiral galaxies.
3.4. Implications
One advantageous application we envision for the M•–
ϕ–vmaxrelation is to use it to construct black hole mass
functions (BHMFs) from surveys of spiral galaxies. Al-
ready, the M•–ϕrelation has been utilized to model the
local BHMF derived from spiral galaxies (Davis et al.
2014; Fusco et al. 2022). The simple addition of vmax,
which is widely available for many spiral galaxies, could
better aid in modeling the shape of the BHMF with
lower scatter. This is particularly useful as the BHMF
is well known at the high-mass end, but lacking clar-
ity at the low-mass end, which is the purview of spiral
galaxies.
The BHMF is virtually unknown at M•<105M⊙
because of a dearth of observational evidence of IMBHs.
Extrapolating the M•–ϕ(Davis et al. 2017) and M•–
vmax(Davis et al. 2019c) relations down to the low-mass
end predicts M•<105M⊙IMBHs at |ϕ|>26.◦8±2.◦3
andvmax<130±15 km s−1. Using these aforementioned
values as inputs to Equation 1, we similarly find a line
across the plane defining the upper-limit at M•<5.0±
0.4 dex. Thus, these values of |ϕ|andvmaxserve as
a sort of midline path down the plane into the IMBH
regime. However, because of the flexibility of the plane,
these need not be hard and fast values for identifyingpotential IMBH-hosting galaxies. That is, a galaxy with
a slightly smaller |ϕ|in conjunction with a slightly larger
vmax, orvice versa , could still lie below M•= 105M⊙on
the fundamental plane. Particularly, in a forthcoming
work (Davis et al. 2023), we use the fundamental plane
to identify strong candidates for IMBH hosts among a
sample of late-type spiral galaxies.
4.CONCLUSIONS
Arguably, spiral galaxies are the most interesting
galaxies. This is not just because of their intrinsic
beauty, but also because they are galactic laboratories
of ongoing star formation, growth, and evolution. More-
over, the most interesting discoveries await in the realm
of low-mass spiral galaxies as potential hosts of elusive
IMBHs. However, these interesting characteristics make
them more difficult to analyze than their more massive,
simpler, and older cousins, i.e., early-type galaxies. In-
deed, commonly-used black hole mass scaling relations
like the M•–σ0(central/bulge stellar velocity dispersion)
orM•–M⋆,sphrelations are far less accurate for late-type
galaxies than early-type galaxies. Specifically, the M•–
σ0relation has an intrinsic scatter of σ= 0.32 dex for
early-type galaxies (Sahu et al. 2019b), cf.σ= 0.57 dex
for late-type galaxies (Davis et al. 2017; Sahu et al.
2019b); the M•–M⋆,sphrelation has an intrinsic scat-
ter of σ= 0.41 dex for early-type galaxies (Sahu et al.
2019a), cf.σ= 0.48 dex for late-type galaxies (Davis
et al. 2019b; Sahu et al. 2019a). Judged upon these cri-
teria, the M•–ϕ–vmaxrelation (with σ= 0.22±0.06 dex)
is not only more accurate than other late-type black
hole mass scaling relations, but also those for early-type
galaxies.
Verily, one might expect that a tighter relationship
would exist for single-component galaxies like ellipti-
cal galaxies, rather than multi-component spiral galax-
ies. However, if we consider the evolution of these
systems and the increase in entropy from spiral to el-
liptical galaxies, it becomes evident that this initial
assumption may not hold. Although late-type galax-
ies may be complex , early-type galaxies are compli-
cated ; the distinction being that complexity implies
many understandable components andcomplication
implying less components, but more chaos and disorder .
This can be understood by tracking the impact of
merger histories and the genesis of morphologically-
dependent black hole mass scaling relations (Graham
2023a; Graham & Sahu 2023a; Graham 2023b; Graham
& Sahu 2023b). As such, the unique merger history of a
galaxy can effectively muddle the ordered rotationally-
supported disk galaxies by transforming them into
dispersion-supported elliptical galaxies. Moreover, this

--- PAGE 9 ---
A Planar Black Hole Mass Scaling Relation 9
helps explain why we find that the strongest correlation
with black hole mass is not via bulge properties, which
are similar to the disordered spheroids of elliptical galax-
ies and may be the result of disk cloaking (Hon et al.
2022).
The fact that the M•–ϕ–vmaxrelation, which corre-
lates the black hole mass with global properties of its
host galaxy’s disk rather than bulge properties, as in
theM•–σ0andM•–M⋆,sphrelations, shows that BH–
galaxy coevolution is active over large scales. Indeed,
recent work (Davies et al. 2019; Oppenheimer et al. 2020;
Sanchez et al. 2023) has shown that M•is inversely cor-
related with the fraction of baryons in the circumgalactic
medium of its host galaxy. This is thought to be be-
cause more massive black holes are more energetic, and
thus transport more baryons beyond their host galaxies’
virial radii, all while reducing gas accretion and star for-
mation over time. This is clear evidence that processes
of a central SMBH are capable of affecting change on
scales over eleven orders of magnitude larger than ex-
tent of their event horizons!10
Extrapolation of black hole mass scaling relations
down into the IMBH range is important for future stud-
ies, including the design and predictions for space-based
gravitational-wave interferometers (Amaro-Seoane et al.
2023). Therefore, we anticipate that the fundamental
plane will be advantageous for estimating the demo-
graphics of IMBHs hosted by spiral galaxies. With more
than one parameter, there is redundancy built into the
planar relationship that makes it more resilient to ab-
normalities in a single parameter, helping it to be more
robust. This adds a degree of confidence when using
it to predict black holes masses below the limits of our
sample (NGC 4395 with M•= 5.62±0.17 dex). More-
over, spiral-arm pitch angle is straightforward enoughto measure that it could be accomplished most basi-
cally with just an uncalibrated image and a protractor.
What is more, vmaxvalues are readily-available from
large 21-cm line width surveys and easily-accessible in
online archives. Therefore, we hope that the M•–ϕ–vmax
relation will facilitate new and impactful studies and in-
fluence further advancements in black hole mass scaling
relations and galaxy evolution.

A.THE MILKY WAY
Sgr A∗in our Galaxy has been robustly studied by many independent methods, determining its black hole mass
with incredible accuracy and precision. We adopt the mass determined by the multi-star orbit analysis of Boehle et al.
(2016), but many such other studies present consistent masses, most notably the black hole mass determined by the
size of its shadow (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2022b). Therefore, we strongly intended to include the
Milky Way in our sample, just as it was included in the determination of the M•–ϕandM•–vmaxrelations. However, our
home galaxy stands out as a significant outlier below the M•–ϕ–vmaxplane, i.e., its dynamically-measured M•is under-
10The Milky Way’s Sgr A∗has a shadow with a radius of 0 .21±
0.01 AU (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2022a)
and the virial radius of the Galaxy is 258 kpc (Klypin et al. 2002),
which is an astounding difference in scale of (2 .52±0.12)×1011.
For comparison, there is similar difference in scale between the
width of a human hair and the radius of Earth.

massive with respect to that predicted by the plane. Specifically, the fundamental plane predicts M•= 7.26±0.24 dex,
whereas Sgr A∗is highly-constrained to M•= 6.60±0.02 dex. You can see how the Milky Way stands out in Figure 4.
In absolute terms, this does not necessarily make the Milky Way the most extreme outlier in the sample, but the
accuracy of its dynamically-measured M•means that it is weighted heavily in the regression of the fundamental
plane. The coefficients for Equation 1, with the Milky Way included, changes to α=−5.57±0.06,β= 3.95±0.06,
γ= 7.31±0.06, and intrinsic scatter σ= 0.28±0.06 dex in the M•-direction. This represents a small change in
the predicted black hole mass; for a galaxy with the median ϕandvmax, the plane without the Milky Way yields
M•= (2.16±1.13)×107M⊙and including the Milky Way it becomes M•= (2.06±1.36)×107M⊙. Thanks to
its position relatively near the balance point of the fundamental plane, its affect does not noticeably tug the plane
off in any direction. However, it does diminish the accuracy of the fundamental plane, as evidenced by the 0.06 dex
increase in the intrinsic scatter due entirely to our Galaxy. Thus, one can choose to use the alternative coefficients for
Equation 1 that considered the Milky Way and yield highly-consistent black hole mass predictions with only a small
decrease in accuracy, which is still more accurate than either the M•–ϕorM•–vmaxrelations alone.
Since the mass of Sgr A∗is practically unassailable, the fault in our Galaxy must lie in its ϕand/or vmax. Of course,
both quantities are difficult to measure from inside the Galaxy; even with modern data, it is hard to truly represent
the geometric shape that astronomers from the Andromeda Galaxy would see or what vmaxthey would measure from
long-slit spectroscopic observations of the Milky Way. As shown in Figure 4, the M•–ϕrelation predicts a less accurate
black hole mass, whereas the M•–vmaxrelation actually predicts a more accurate black hole mass than the fundamental
plane. Indeed, rearranging Equation 1 to solve for ϕyields a prediction of |ϕ|= 19.◦3±2.◦1 for the Galaxy, which is
not far-fetched to envision. Our adopted value of 13 .◦1±0.◦6 (Vall´ ee 2015) is the median pitch angle derived from a
meta-analysis of 50 studies with a range of 3◦≤ |ϕ| ≤28◦. Moreover, with our intimate vantage of the Milky Way,
observations can be overwhelmed with small-scale structures, such as a high pitch angle structure in the Sagittarius
Arm (Kuhn et al. 2021), that can complicate determinations of the global Galactic pitch angle.
For a final consideration, it could be that Sgr A∗is simply under-massive. Indeed, Oppenheimer et al. (2020) point
out that Sgr A∗is under-massive with respect to other SMBHs in galaxies with similarly-sized halos as the Milky Way.
In fact, it is thought that an under-massive Sgr A∗could be conducive to supporting the genesis of life in the Milky

Way ( e.g., Lingam et al. 2019). Thus, the Milky Way, and its central black hole, must be at least consistent with the
anthropic principle (Dicke 1957).
