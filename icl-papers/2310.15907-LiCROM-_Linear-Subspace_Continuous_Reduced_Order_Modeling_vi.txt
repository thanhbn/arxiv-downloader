I can see that there's already a Vietnamese translation of the paper 2310.15907. The translation appears to be a summary/abbreviated version rather than a complete translation of the full paper content shown in your input. 

The existing Vietnamese file (`2310.15907_vi.txt`) contains:
- The title and author information in Vietnamese
- A translated abstract
- Section headings for CCS concepts, keywords, and introduction

However, your input showed the complete 12-page paper with detailed content, figures, tables, equations, and references. The existing translation is just a brief summary.

Would you like me to:
1. **Update the existing file** with a complete translation of all the content you provided (all 12 pages)
2. **Keep the existing brief version** as is
3. **Create a new file** with the complete translation alongside the existing brief version

The complete translation would be significantly longer and include all the technical details, mathematical equations, experimental results, figures descriptions, and full reference list that you provided in your input.
