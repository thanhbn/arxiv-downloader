Abstract
Quantum computers have the potential to expand the utility of lattice gauge theory to
investigate non-perturbative particle physics phenomena that cannot be accessed using a
standard Monte Carlo method due to the sign problem. Thanks to the qubit, quantum
computers can store Hilbert space in a more efficient way compared to classical computers.
This allows the Hamiltonian approach to be computationally feasible, leading to absolute
freedom from the sign-problem. But what the current noisy intermediate scale quantum
hardware can achieve is under investigation, and therefore we chose to study the energy
spectrum and the time evolution of an SU(2) theory using two kinds of quantum hardware:
the D-Wave quantum annealer and the IBM gate-based quantum hardware.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my PhD supervisor Professor Lewis for
introducing and guiding me in my exploration of the field of quantum computing, enlightening
me on many aspects of the research program. Over the past few years I have appreciated
his unbounded patience, his ability to always find time, the clearness in dealing with my
always twisted questions and most importantly, his scientific generosity devoted to creating
opportunities and constantly encouraging me to move forward, from my first day, to summer
schools and conferences, to my postdoc application and even further.
I would like also to thank Professor Matthew C. Johnson and Professor Sean Tulin for
having found the time to follow me through these years as part of my PhD research evaluation
committee and by providing valuable advice and pointing me in good directions, furthermore
I thank Professor Johnson for the extra support and advice during my postdoc applications
period.
During these years the challenge of engaging with quantum computing was eased by collabo-
rating with Sarah Powell and Sarmed A Rahman by sharing together good notes, advices and
two interesting works on quantum computing.
Since my arrival I have enjoyed sharing an office with Brian Colquhoun, and off the lattice,
being guided to the best concerts in town even if it meant walking to the venue during a crazy
snow storm or while it was raining cats and dogs. After the social upheaval of Covid-19 I
had the pleasure of enjoying the company of new colleagues Ali Hosseinzadehkavaki, William
Parrott and Matthew Tsang with whom I actively shared liters of coffee in the pursuit of
solving a problem about a wrong minus sign, what people call the scientific endeavour, and
some good pub crawling.

There is something unique about living in Canada, especially when one comes from a mono-
cultural European country, like Italy. In fact, the amazing complexity of a country so
geographically extensive with such a diverse population made by Anglophones, Francophones,
First Nations, Metis and constant influx of new immigrants, with different cultures, histories,
cuisines and living in a vast territory all united by a strong sense of belonging to a country
built by the contribution of so many. A society that it is not afraid to openly show that is
naturally multicultural, a place that will inevitably foster a sense of belonging even to who,
will be there temporarily, and for this I am once again grateful to Professor Lewis for this life
opportunity.

In this respect, Toronto gave me the amazing life experience that it will bring with me
in the future, to grow up by sharing for four years in a quite large house with people from
around the world, Ahmed al Baghdadi from Egypt, Dominique Monrose from Saint Lucia,
Mallika Kumar from India, Yeraldin Molina from Venezuela, Samantha Baker from Jamaica
and Zulqarnain Kazmi from Pakistan/Saudi Arabia, all with such a diverse and complex
background but all united in their life journey to become permanent residents and future
citizens, and to be permanently contributing to one of the most respectful and multicultural
countries promoting inclusion in every possible way. You can image how amazingly complex
our interactions were, mediated by diverse languages, cultures, religions and cuisines. We
inevitably experienced deep joy in sharing delicious food, cheerful moments playing around
and walking and biking in TO and tense time when someone was leaving for their next stage
of life. I have directly and indirectly learned countless many life lessons from them and I am
deeply grateful for their understanding, patience and friendship and I take this opportunity
to wish them once again all the best in their future.
I thank my family for the support even though life’s hardships and distance have made
everything a little stretched and twisted, but nevertheless it is always like a safe rock reachable
whatever the ocean storm is.
I cannot be happier to have met Cortney here in Toronto, immediately I saw her brightness,
and I am immensely grateful for her boundless, unconditional love and a truly 4πsteradians
support in every possible way during these years, even getting closer to get a minor in physics.
I will always keep in my heart her patience while I was writing the thesis and continuously
reminding me to "sit down and don’t try to boil the ocean". We have a long road ahead
and it can only be wonderful. Dulcis in fundo, a special thought goes to her cats Toby and
Anders, "cagnolini" who with their cheerfulness manage to sweep away any sign of stress, and
induce joy just by looking at them.

3.1Results of block diagonalization for the five physics systems considered. Each
system is labelled by the lattice size expressed in plaquettes number, Nplaq
and, the gauge truncation jmax. In the third column the full Hamiltonian block
decomposition is displayed and in the last column the groundstate block size. 39
4.1List of the most common available gates which are used in this chapter, an
extended list of the default IBM gates present in the Qiskit library can be
found here [179]. The first eight gates listed are single qubit gates: Pauli X
Pauli Y, Pauli Z, the rotation gates RX, RY and RZ, the Hadamard Hand the
Sgate, the last three act on a pair of qubits. The first two are Controlled-x
gates CX ijand they applies a Pauli-X gate on the jqubit when the iqubit
is in the state |1⟩, and leave it unchanged when the iqubit is in the state |0⟩,
while the last one, the SWAP gate, as the name suggest swaps the states of
two qubits. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 59

1.3Two examples of QCD (T−µB)phase diagrams displaying the conjectured
QCD phases and the phases known from LQCD simulations. The left diagram
displays most of the hypothetical QCD phases, and the green line represents the
most accredited cooling down path of the early universe toward the formation of
hadrons in a process called hadronization from calculation in Ref. [24]. Figure
taken from Ref. [25]. The right diagram displays the state of the art of the only
known phases from LQCD simulations with the addition of the conjectured and
notoriously debated second-order endpoint. Figure taken from Ref. [26]. As a
reference a temperature of 1 MeV corresponds to 1010Kand for comparison the
Sun’s core temperature is 10−4MeV. The two diagrams clearly show that it is
well accepted the absence of a phase transition in the region of temperature
range 150-170 MeV for small value of the chemical potential µB, therefore the
two phases, hadron gas and quark gluon plasma can continuously transform
into each other. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11
1.4QCD (T−µB)phase diagram displaying the regions investigated by current and
future experimental facilities. The diagram shows the parameters region of the
phase diagram where current experiments are ongoing or planned. The three
arrows indicate the starting point of the heavy ion beams and the targeting
area of the phase diagram that they plan to access. The experiment at RHIC
using BES and LHC using SPS are ongoing with some results in [29, 30],
while two accelerators are under construction [31] with projects planned to
directly investigate regions not accessible to LHC and RHIC, Nuclotron-based
Ion Collider Facility (NICA) in Dubna, Russia and Facility for Antiproton
and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany and their future projects
Nuclotron-M at FAIR and SIS-100 and SIS-300 at NICA.Furthermore, the
region where LQCD simulations are possible is highlighted in gray. As a
reference a temperature of 1 MeV corresponds to 1010Kand for comparison
the Sun core temperature is 10−4MeV.Figure taken from [32]. . . . . . . . . 13

empirical Moore’s law. In the right panel the exponential rise of the number
of transistors inside an integrated circuit as a function of year, displayed in
logarithm scale, figure taken from [37]. This has an effect on the single transistor

The exponential rise of the number of transistors inside an integrated circuit
per year show in Figure 1.5 has an effect on the single transistor size. The
transistor size is quantified by the wire widths and displayed in logarithm scale
as function of year. The pink and blue points are common time transistor size,
while future size predictions are shown by the black dashed lines. The graph
shows that the physical limits of atomic size will be reached between 2040 and
2050. Figure taken from [38]. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16
2.1The lattice notation is: a link is denoted by a line connecting two nodes
indicated by black dots. From left to right we have a single link, a plaquette, a
row of plaquettes and a square of plaquettes. A row of plaquettes can be used
to map a 1-dimensional lattice while the square of plaquettes can be used to
map a 2-dimensional lattice. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23
2.2A 4-plaquette lattice with periodic boundary condition in the longitudinal
direction. The lattice is composed by 4 plaquettes made by the union of 12
gauge links which are joined by 8 nodes. Each plaquette is indicated by the
label in the center of each square, each link by the letter at the middle point,
and each node by the closest number. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23

2.4The four possible states available on the 2-plaquette lattice after the jmax= 1/2
truncation. Each solid line means a j= 1/2flux of energy is present, while the
dashed line a j= 0meaning no energy is present. If all the links of a plaquette
have j= 1/2we label the plaquette as switched “on”, otherwise the plaquette
is switched “off”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28

solid curve is the exact probability of the left (right) plaquette having an energy
flux of j= 1/2over time. In both panels the small diagrams using the notation

an energy flux of j >0over time. The plot confirms that traveling exicitation
are SU(2) phenomena and not an artefact of small jtruncation. . . . . . . . 32

4.1Example of qubit layout and connectivity of some of the available IBM quantum
hardware. Each qubit is represented by a circle and the interqubit connection
by a bar. In these specific figures taken from the IBM quantum experience, the
color on the qubits indicated the readout error associated with the measurement
of each qubit, while the color of the bars the error associated to each CX. The
error range is indicated in a scale from black to light violet, with black for the
lowest error rate and light violet for the highest error rate, which are based on
the hardware calibration at the time of the picture was taken. The hardware
layout were taken from [178]. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61

Introduction
1.1 Lattice QCD and its methods
Inside the Standard Model of particle physics, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a
theory introduced to describe all the interactions mediated by the strong force. The theory
assumes the existence of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons and describes their
individual behaviour and their mutual interactions under the action of the strong force which
is assumed to be mediated by gluons. Furthermore, their description assumes the existence of
spinor fermion fields for quarks and vector fields for gluons. Aside from the common electric
charge for quarks, both these fields have one new peculiar internal degree of freedom called a
colour charge.
Up to this point, human knowledge was supported by extensive theoretical description, highly
intensive numerical simulations and numerous precision experiments which gives us the possi-
bility to state that QCD is the universally accepted theory for describing the strong interaction.
Following the approach by Yang and Mills [1], a theory can be built by requiring the
fields describing the particles are gauge invariant under a chosen non-Abelian group. For the
case of QCD the group is SU(3), a special unitary group of 3×3matrices, Hermitian and
with determinant equal to 1. The theory can be described in the continuum space-time by
the following Lagrangian density:
LQCD=−1
4Ga
µνGa µν+X
fψf(i γµDµ−mf)ψf (1.1)
where ψfis a fermion quark field with mass mf, where fspecifies the flavour of quarks known
(up, down, charm, strange, top and beauty).
γµare the Dirac gamma matrices, 4×4matrices with {γµ, γn}= 2ηµνI4, where ηµν=
diag(1,−1,−1,−1).

µis the gauge covariant derivative, where Tawith arunning from 1
to 8 are eight generators of the Lie algebra of the SU(3) color group. The eight generators
represented by 3×3Gell-Mann matrices are subject to the following commutation relations

Finally,

is the gluon field strength tensor.
The gauge invariance of the QCD Lagrangian under the non-Abelian local gauge trans-
formation is guaranteed by the following gauge transformation of its elements:
ψ(x)→ψ′(x) = Ω( x)ψ(x), (1.3)
ψ(x)′→ψ(x)Ω†(x), (1.4)
Dµ→D′
µ= Ω(x)DµΩ(x)†, (1.5)
Aµ(x)→Aµ(x)′= Ω(x)Aµ(x)Ω(x)†+i(∂µΩ(x)) Ω(x)†. (1.6)
where Ω(x)belongs to the fundamental representation of SU(3), and can be written as
Ω(x)≡e−iTaθa(x)where ωaare the 8 gauge transformation parameters.
It is now important to consider the action of the theory because it is used to quantize
the classical theory and secondly it is used in the lattice formulation of QCD. Its form is
defined as:
SQCD=Z

Since the exponential contains an imaginary term, the integrand is a highly oscillating
function ill suited to be integrated numerically especially for a high-dimensional integral. It
is usually rewritten by performing the Wick rotation, by changing the time variable from
real to imaginary, x0→ − ix4and extending it to the gauge fields A0→iA4. Then we
introduce the Euclidean gamma matrices γE
µwhich are defined by the anticommutation

The action is now in a form that can be numerically integrated, however since the time is
now imaginary we cannot study its real-time dynamics and we are restricted to investigate
only static properties.
Many theoretical properties can be inferred by calculating the expectation value of an
operator Ousing the Feynman path integral formalism:
⟨O⟩=R

QCD[ψ,¯ψ,A]
R
DψD ¯ψDA e−SE
QCD[ψ,¯ψ,A](1.9)

--- PAGE 18 ---
The quantization of the theory is commonly performed using the Feynman functional-integral
formalism in which all the possible n-points Green functions defined as the vacuum expectation
value of time-ordered product of nfields ϕ(x):
⟨0|T[ˆϕ(x1),ˆϕ(x2), . . . , ˆϕ(xn)]|0⟩. (1.10)
whose value contributes not only to the calculation of the probability amplitude of a given
process cross section that we are interested in, but can be used to extract the information on
the spectrum as well as various other properties of the theory.
In this formalism Green functions are calculated simply as:
⟨0|T[ˆϕ(x1),ˆϕ(x2), . . . , ˆϕ(xn)]|0⟩=R
DψD ¯ψˆϕ(x1),ˆϕ(x2), . . . , ˆϕ(xn)O[ψ,¯ψ, A]e−iSQCD [ψ,¯ψ,A]
R
DψD ¯ψDA e−iS[ψ,¯ψ,A]
(1.11)
These integrals can only be calculated analytically on rare occasions and, therefore a
numerical approach has to be used. In attempting a numerical integration, we have to deal
with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, since the fields are defined all over the space. We
therefore have to discretize it and the time, which results in the introduction of a space-time
lattice, that directly brings us toward defining a lattice gauge theory on a lattice, or in our
specific case QCD on a lattice.
The discussion regarding the problem of fixing the gauge that will lead to the presence of
Faddeev-Popov ghost is quite an important aspect, but since in the lattice formulation there
is no necessity to fix the gauge, we point the interested reader to the standard QCD textbooks
[2–4], from which part of this discussion has been deduced.
QCD is a theory rich with phenomena, the first striking one is related to its coupling
strength whose value is not constant. In fact using arguments from the renomalization group
it is possible to show that at the leading order of perturbation theory [5] its expression is:
αs(Q) =12π
(33−2Nf) log( Q2/Λ2), (1.12)
where Nfis the number of quark flavours used in the calculation, Qis the momentum
transferred between particles and Λis the QCD scale parameter, a constant to be determined
experimentally which is necessary to match the theory prediction with the experiment results
at a given energy scale.
The strength of the strong force changes with the momentum transferred Qinside a process
giving the theory two main regimes, a perturbative regime studied analytically and a non-
perturbative regime that uses mainly numerical computation on supercomputers.
In fact, for large values of the momentum transferred Q, or at short distances, the coupling
constant gets smaller and the theory becomes asymptotically free when Q→0meaning that
the quarks and gluons are free particles and no bound states are present. When αs≪1in the
perturbation regime the theory can be approximated using a perturbative expansion that uses
the Feynman diagram approach to predict using analytical calculation the theory phenomena.
3

--- PAGE 19 ---
Conversely, for small values of Q, or large distances, the coupling constant gets larger
therefore quarks and gluons are confined in bound states commonly called hadrons. In this
non-perturbative regime the main investigation approach is called lattice QCD (LQCD), in
which the theory is discretized by first principles on a 4-dimensional lattice and studied by
numerical simulations using supercomputers.
1.1.1 Introducing the lattice
In 1974 Kenneth Wilson introduced in his seminal paper [6] the idea of discretizing a gauge
theory from first principles, giving life to the field that is now referred to as lattice gauge
theory (LGT). This idea paved the way to the possibility of studying the theory phenomena
by numerical simulations, which was done for the first time by Michael Creutz in 1979 [7].
In this approach the continuum space-time is discretized by using a 4-dimensional lattice
with lattice spacing a, and the theory is defined from first principles on the lattice by direct
discretizing its continuum version or by introducing new discrete definitions of the interaction.
This freedom in choosing different definition for the discrete theory is only restricted by
reproducing the continuum theory when a→0.
The introduction of the lattice has the important role of regularizing the theory because it
restricts the momentum in the range (−π/a, π/a ), de facto introducing a cutoff of order 1/a
making the high and low energy divergencies of the theory finite. Therefore, any quantity
calculated on the lattice is a function of the lattice spacing a, and to obtain the value corre-
sponding to the continuum physics, when the lattice is removed a→0, the theory has to be
renormalized, by redefining the bare parameters of the theory like the particles masses, in
such a way that the physical observables are independent of the lattice spacing a→0and
assumes the known experimental value. The only evident negative effect of the lattice is the
breaking of the rotational and Lorentz invariance which are restored in the continuum limit,
which can limit the use of certain types of observables.
The hypercubic lattice with linear sizes Lµand lattice and spacing athat discretizes the
space-time is formally defined as:
Λ ={xµ=anµ|nµ= 0,1, . . . L µ/a} (1.13)
The necessary prescription to perform the discretization of the action are:
xµ→nµa , (1.14)
ψ(x),ψ(x)→ψ(na),ψ(na), (1.15)Z
d4x . . . →a4X
n. . . , (1.16)
∂µψ(x)→1
2a(ψ(n+ ˆµ)−ψ(n−ˆµ)) +O(a2), (1.17)
which are very handy for showing that the lattice theory reproduces the continuum theory.

The spinors ψ(n),ψ(n)representing the fermion and the anti-fermion are placed on the
nodes or sites of the lattice, while link oriented variable Uµ(n)is attached to each link
connecting two sites, n,n+µrepresented in Figure 1.1.

Figure 1.1: Spatial representation of two link link variable U−µ(n)andUµ(n).
Uµis the fundamental gluonic variable representing the gauge field, the gluon vector po-
tential field on the lattice and it is connected with the continuum form Aµ(x)by the relation
Uµ=eigaA µ(n), that is the lattice version of the Schwinger line integral in the continuum
theory eiPRx+aˆµ
xdxµAµ(x).
One of the most peculiar characteristics of the lattice approach is that it preserves the
gauge invariance without the need to impose a gauge fixing. In fact to ensure that the lattice
action will be gauge invariant under SU(3) local color rotations it is enough that the lattice
fields ψ(n),ψ(n)andUµtransform under the action of an SU(3) element Ω(n)as:
ψ(n)→ψ′(n) = Ω( n)ψ(n), (1.18)
ψ′(n)→ψ(n)Ω†(n), (1.19)
Uµ(n)→U′
µ(n) = Ω( n)Uµ(n)Ω†(n+ ˆµ), (1.20)
U†
µ(n)→U′†
µ(n) = Ω( n+ ˆµ)U†
µ(n)Ω†(n). (1.21)
To convince ourselves of the correctness of this approach it is enough to check that these
invariance relations under the group element reproduce the ones of the continuum in A.4.
In particular to stress the connection by Aµ(x)andUµ(n)it is enough to notice that by
substituting Uµ=eigaA µ(n)in Eq. 1.21, expanding for small aand performing the continuum
limit one obtains the continuum transformation of Aµ(x)under the group element.
Now that we have placed the necessary fields on the lattice and imposed the gauge in-
variance we can start building the action of QCD on the lattice, by working separately on the
gauge and fermionic parts.
Using an argument by Wilson, the gauge action part should contain only gauge invari-
ant elements. Therefore the simplest gauge-invariant operator that we can build on the lattice
is the trace of a path-ordered product of link variables around a lattice spatial square, where
the path-ordered product of link variables is called a plaquette and it is defined as:
Uµν(n) =Uµ(n)Uν(n+ ˆµ)U†
µ(n+ ˆν)U†

counterclockwise as indicated by the circle with µandνexpressing the two possible space
directions. The plaquette Uµν(n)located at site nin the µν−plane.
It is important to notice that by substituting Uµ=eiagA µ(n)in the definition of the
plaquette in Eq. 1.22 one gets:
Uµν(n) = exp( ia2g{∂µAν(n)−∂νAµ(n) +ig[Aµ(n), Aν(n)]}+O(a3)) =eiga2Gµν(n)+O(a3)
(1.23)
where Gµν(n)is a discretized form of the field strength tensor Gµν(x)in Eq. A.3.
Therefore the Wilson gauge action invariant under the local transformations in Eq. 1.18
is a sum of all plaquettes as:

.(1.24)
where the sum over Pextends over all distinct plaquettes on the lattice taken all in the same
counterclockwise (clockwise) direction.
Furthermore, it is easy to reproduce the continuum limit, by first expanding the term using
the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for small lattice spacing aand finally perform the
limit a→0obtaining the continuum expression of the gauge part present in Eq. 1.8.
The introduction of the fermion action on the lattice is not as smooth as in the case for
the gauge field part of the action indicator, because there are subtleties. In fact, by naively
discretizing the continuum fermionic action with the help of symmetric approximation for the
derivative in Eq. A.20 leads to:
SF,naive

(1.25)
that is known as the naive fermionic action, because despite it is gauge invariant, it does not
reproduce the correct continuum physics.
Essentially it introduces unphysical lattice artefacts called doublers, more fermion-like exci-
tations in the momentum space than there should be. In fact, by calculating the two-point
fermionic correlation function it has more poles than there should be. Therefore, first the
fermion fields are treated as Grassmann anticommuting numbers and, secondly in Wilson
formulation to remove the doublers an ad hoc term is introduced in the naive fermionic
6

--- PAGE 22 ---
action, in such a way that when we take the continuum limit a→0they disappear. This
unfortunately is done at the expense of breaking the continuum chiral symmetry even for
vanishing quark masses. It is possible to avoid the doublers in the strong interaction by
defining lattice chiral symmetry in a way that accounts for the Nielsen–Ninomiya no-go
theorem [8, 9] and its recent generalization [10]. Many different fermionic formulations can be
obtained with their own advantages and disadvantages, and it is a lively research area.
The fermion action with doublers removed using the Wilson term is:

where we have defined γ−µ=−γµwith µ= 1,2,3,4.
Now that we have the full LQCD in the Wilson formulation we can find the partition
function for the LQCD:

where in the second step we wrote the fermion integration measure as a measure Grassmann
number, and in the last line the Matthews–Salam formula for the integration of a Gaussian
integral with Grassmann numbers was used [11], where det[D]is the determinant of the Dirac
operator.
Now that we have the LQCD action all the theory information can be extracted by cal-
culating gauge invariant operators called correlators:

which are commonly calculated numerically, as described in the next section.
In conclusion, the freedom to propose different definitions of the discrete QCD action makes
the formalism very powerful because it can be adapted to conceptual and numerical needs.
Therefore much more should be said for example about the other formulations of the fermion
action with smaller errors or better computational cost compared to the Wilson fermion,
but since we are not going to be using them in the discussion of this thesis, we point to
the following well known LQCD textbooks [3, 11–13] from which this presentation has been
adapted.

The success of LQCD helps understand that the strong interaction is quite vast from the
determination of the quark masses, Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix for quark-mixing,
decay constants, the gµ−2and much more. For a review of the progress in the last 50 years
see [14, 15].
1.1.2 The importance sampling Monte Carlo method
In the lattice gauge theory approach to find the expectation value of an observables the
following expression has to be calculated:
⟨O⟩=R
D[C]O[C]e−S[C]
R
D[C]e−S[C](1.29)
where the integration measure is on all the {C}possible configurations of the system.
This expression can be integrated analytically only for theories whose actions are simple,
therefore for a generic theory a numerical approach has to be used.
With the goal of choosing the most suitable numerical integration method, it is reason-
able to estimate how numerically intensive the calculation is. For the sake of simplicity
consider a 4-dimensional lattice with size Land a theory with only variables on the lattice
nodes and no variables on each link. For example a Potts model based on the Z3group, where
the spin on each node can take 3 values. The number of all possible configurations is equal to
the many possible ways we can organize spins on the lattice that is equal to 3L4and grows
exponentially with the system volume. Considering a modest lattice size L= 10we have
3104≈104762, it follows that it is not possible to sum all of these terms, and consequently a
more complex theory is even more numerically challenging.
Aclueforanefficientwayisobtainedbycarefullyobservingtheintegrand, whereonecannotice
that not all configurations contribute equally due to the Boltzmann weight exp(−S). In fact,
configurations with a high value for Sare exponentially suppressed, so their contribution to
the sum is negligible, therefore an estimation of the integral can be obtained by just summing a
few configurations with small actions. This is the concept behind the importance sampling [16].
A Monte Carlo using importance sampling will randomly generate a set of Nconfigurations
Cwith a probability distribution given by exp (−S[Cn]), and an observable expectation value
⟨O⟩is approximated as:
1
NNX
n=1O[Cn]± OσO√
N
(1.30)
where the error is only proportional to 1/√
Nbecause O[Cn]are not statistically independent,
because the configurations are not completely independent due to the way they are generated.
Essentially, the system is prepared in an initial configuration, and each new configuration
candidate (obtained from the previous one by changing the value of all or a few spins) is
always accepted if it has a lower or equal action and, if it does not have a lower action is
accepted randomly with a low acceptance rate to recreate quantum fluctuations numerically.

--- PAGE 24 ---
By repeating this process, a reasonable number of times, the system will reach the equilibrium,
where each new accepted configuration does not have a significantly lower action, and these
equilibrium configurations are the ones used to measure O[C].
The subject is vast and fascinating, and thanks to it we have been able to understand
many characteristics of the strong interactions over the last 50 years [14]. Here we wanted to
emphasize the crucial role of using the Monte Carlo, therefore the full discussion about it can
be found in the following well known LQCD textbook [3, 11, 13] from which this discussion
has been adapted.
1.2The sign problem and the necessity to find new ways
of computation
The Monte Carlo method with importance sampling used to perform lattice gauge theory
calculations stops working whenever the exponential of the action inside the partition function
in Eq. 1.27 becomes negative or complex. Therefore it cannot be interpreted as a probability
distribution. If we cannot use importance sampling we are back to evaluating the full integral
in traditional way in which all the points in the integration region are assumed to contribute
equally to the final sum, and we have seen that this way of integrating scales exponentially
with the size of the volume of the system. Therefore no integration can be done on a system
of interest in particle physics.
To solve the sign problem one could be tempted to perform a re-weighting, by taking
the absolute value of integrand of the partition function, but as it was clearly shown by the
authors in Ref. [17] the relative error associated with the observable measured using this
trick increases exponentially with the volume of the system. Therefore, to achieve reasonable
accuracy an exponentially larger number of Monte Carlo configurations has to be generated,
a numerical task possible only for particular systems with mild sign problems.
Nevertheless, many researchers are constantly trying to propose novel methods to avoid,
but not solve, the sign problem and a recent review of the current state of the art of the
computation methods that are being explored can be found in Ref. [18]. Moreover, applications
of these methods to QCD suffer from residual mild sign problem that require non-polynomial
computational resources and therefore broad applications on large systems remain daunting.
Furthermore, for the analytical dual approaches in which the theory affected by the sign
problem is analytically mapped to another without it, reviewed in Ref. [19], their applicability
is still under investigation because for each theory a dual formulation has to be developed.
Consequently, at the moment there is no comprehensive method that can take the role of the
Monte Carlo method and therefore other methods should be developed and explored.
In the following subsections we discuss with some details the impact of the sign problem on
the possibility to study interesting non-perturbative aspects of QCD using LQCD methods
and in general of lattice gauge theories, and use them as motivation in regards to the necessity
9

--- PAGE 25 ---
of developing and exploring new computational methods.
1.2.1 Real-time evolution
In constructing the lattice gauge theory method to make the action real and positive we
have to perform the Wick rotation, which transforms time from real to imaginary, so that
we can interpret the Boltzmann weight as a probability distribution and use the MC with
importance sampling. This has no consequences in deriving static properties but completely
rules out the possibility of studying any equilibrium quantity in real time. If instead we do not
perform the Wick rotation we have a "dynamical" sign problem. Real-time standard evolution
that uses the Hamiltonian formulation is not computationally feasible due to the exponential
scaling of the computation with the size of the system. Therefore a serious limitation is
present because we cannot visualize many processes, for example a particle propagating in
space, how a strongly interacting matter evolves over real-time under the action of external
parameters, or even more interesting, observing in real-time the process of a quark-antiquark
pair string breaking that could give a hint on the mechanism behind quark confinement.
Finally, while we are well equipped to reconstruct system properties from initial and final
static states, in general one can hope to learn and gain insight into the behaviour of the
theory if it can be directly simulated in real time.
1.2.2 Simulations with baryon chemical potential µB
The QCD action in Eq. 1.1 describes a system that has perfect symmetry between matter
and antimatter, but if we are to consider a system like our reality in which there is more matter
that antimatter, a term must be introduced that can tune an imbalance between quarks and
antiquarks. This term is analogous to the chemical potential in the grand canonical ensemble
of statistical mechanics. In this case a baryonic chemical potential quantifies the energy
variation of the system as the number of baryons and antibaryons varies. Unfortunately, this
term makes the QCD action complex and there is a sign problem, so we are not completely
free to simulate the theory in the presence of a non-zero chemical potential. This excludes
from LQCD simulations many interesting physical phenomena connected with the evolution
of the early universe or the state of the matter inside the core of a neutron star, and, more
importantly excludes the possibility of directly comparing the simulations with experiments
such as the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision currently at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) at the Brookhaven national laboratory (BNL) and at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), that are designed to
investigate quark-gluon-plasma with baryon chemical potential tunable by the total center of
mass energy.
1.2.3 QCD phase diagram
The QCD (T−µB)phase diagram describes the different phases of the theory as a function
of the temperature of the system Tand the baryonic chemical potential µBmainly in the
non-perturbative regime. Compared to other diagrams, like for example (T−µI)where µI
isospin chemical potential, it is the most studied QCD phase diagram because it is almost
10

--- PAGE 26 ---
unsolved due to the numerical difficulty related to the sign problem and the long ongoing
experiments at high energy. An overview of the current knowledge can be found in the reviews
[20, 21], while [22] contains a review of how to investigate possible phase transitions from
LQCD.
From the QCD properties it is known that at low temperatures quarks and gluons are confined,
bound inside hadrons. While at high temperatures they are deconfined, that means that
they are substantially free to form at first a gas of hadron, and a perfect liquid with low
viscosity commonly called quark-gluon-plasma for even higher temperatures. For intermediate
temperature and non-zero chemical potential should be present several phase transitions based
on symmetries reasoning from idealized limits of the theory but not yet confirmed [23]. This
conceptual idea of phase diagram is shown in Figure 1.3.
Figure 1.3: Two examples of QCD (T−µB)phase diagrams displaying the conjectured QCD
phases and the phases known from LQCD simulations. The left diagram displays most of the
hypothetical QCD phases, and the green line represents the most accredited cooling down
path of the early universe toward the formation of hadrons in a process called hadronization
from calculation in Ref. [24]. Figure taken from Ref. [25].

with the addition of the conjectured and notoriously debated second-order endpoint. Figure
taken from Ref. [26]. As a reference a temperature of 1 MeV corresponds to 1010Kand for
comparison the Sun’s core temperature is 10−4MeV. The two diagrams clearly show that it
is well accepted the absence of a phase transition in the region of temperature range 150-170
MeV for small value of the chemical potential µB, therefore the two phases, hadron gas and
quark gluon plasma can continuously transform into each other.
Due to the sign problem, LQCD simulations can only investigate the phase diagram along
the T-axis in the absence of chemical potential µB= 0, and for very small values of µbusing
clever extrapolation methods, the exact region is highlighted in gray in Figure 1.4. Reliable
LQCD simulations have determined that along the T-axis the transition between the hadron
gas and the quark-gluon-plasma is a smooth process in which the hadron gas can continuously
transform into a quark-gluon gas, which is called analytical crossover [27, 28]. For the other
phases shown in the left figure we do not have definitive knowledge of their existence, in fact
11

--- PAGE 27 ---
those phases are conjectured based on studies using effective models of QCD. Therefore for
reasons of universality, they should be present in the full QCD, but they have not yet been
proven.
Therefore, further investigations are needed for these hypothesized phases both through
simulations and from experiments, for example with heavy ion collision as shown in Figure
1.4, some of which are currently under way at RHIC and LHC and future facilities are under
construction, and a review of their results and the impact they can have in our understanding
of strong interacting matter can be found here [29, 30].

future experimental facilities. The diagram shows the parameters region of the phase diagram
where current experiments are ongoing or planned. The three arrows indicate the starting
point of the heavy ion beams and the targeting area of the phase diagram that they plan
to access. The experiment at RHIC using BES and LHC using SPS are ongoing with some
results in [29, 30], while two accelerators are under construction [31] with projects planned to
directly investigate regions not accessible to LHC and RHIC, Nuclotron-based Ion Collider
Facility (NICA) in Dubna, Russia and Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in
Darmstadt, Germany and their future projects Nuclotron-M at FAIR and SIS-100 and SIS-300
at NICA.Furthermore, the region where LQCD simulations are possible is highlighted in gray.
As a reference a temperature of 1 MeV corresponds to 1010Kand for comparison the Sun
core temperature is 10−4MeV.Figure taken from [32].
Finally, from the leftmost diagram in Figure 1.3 we can see the negative impact of the
sign problem in our understanding of QCD phases. In fact we can only get extra information
about the phases of the system for points along the T-axis where µ= 0, and any other point
in the plane is not accessible with LQCD simulations. So even if in the last 50 years many
techniques have been developed to get around the problem of the sign when it is present
in a mild form, such as when the chemical potential is small enough, such as the Taylor
expansion, the Lefschetz thimbles, the Complex Langevin and the reweighting-method or
performing the analytic continuation to simulations with imaginary chemical potential [33])
13

--- PAGE 29 ---
they are limited and a more general and direct numerical approach is needed to compare
first-principle calculation with experimental results and, guide future experiments towards a
range of parameters that are more interesting to study.
1.2.4 Out-of-equilibrium process
Within the lattice gauge theory approach based on the MC method only equilibrium
configurations can be simulated. Therefore access to out-of-equilibrium processes are com-
pletely excluded. But there are many interesting out-of-equilibrium processes that we cannot
simulate, for example the dynamics of a system close to a phase transition, the many interest-
ing transient states of matter during the rapid expansion of the early universe, or processes
immediately after a collision or a particle decay. These, in particular, exclude the possibility
to oversee simulations directly with collision experiments performed in many accelerators
around the world.
Even if this type of study is not directly influenced by the sign problem, simulating an out-of-
equilibrium process requires an amount of computational resources that scales exponentially
with the size of the system. Therefore classical calculations are limited to low-dimensional
systems with little application to particle physics models, and other computational methods
need to be explored.
1.2.5 The end of Moore’s law
The necessity to find a new way to simulate nature has other contributions that are
relevant not only to highly intensive simulations in particle physics but in general to society
since everyday life activities require a constant growth in the computational power [34].
Much of the LQCD advancements in understanding the strong force have come from the
enormous advances in classical computational power over the past 50 years, and much more
is expected in the future as the era of exascale computing unfolds [35, 36], where a high-
performance computing system will be able to do about 1018floating point operations per
second, but it is not clear that classical computing will continue to progress as rapidly as it
has in the past.
In fact, in the unremitting effort to increase computing performance, the chip industries
are approaching the end of Moore’s law, reaching the limit of miniaturization of transistors.
Transistor are the building blocks of a computer central processing unit (CPU), effectively
quantifying the computing power in terms of how many operations in parallel a computer can
do. A Transistor is an electric driven switches that works by controlling the current flowing
inside a wire connecting its two ends with an external voltage. Those ends called drain and
source are made of silicon doped with other elements like arsenic, boron, phosphorus and
gallium. Those elements have many more electrons so that the doped silicon behaves as a
metallic material.

empirical Moore’s law. In the right panel the exponential rise of the number of transistors

from [37]. This has an effect on the single transistor size as it is shown in the left panel, where
the transistor size is quantified by the wire widths, with pink and blue points actual transistor
size, and future size prediction are shown by the black dashed lines, reaching the physical
limits of atomic size between 2040 and 2050.
Moore’s law describes empirically the growth of the number of transistors in an integrated
chip doubles every 18-24 months [39, 40] as shown in the left panel of Figure 1.5. This
exponential growth requires a progressive miniaturization of transistors that now are commonly
around 7-10 nm in size with announcements for a 2 nm transistor by IBM [41]. If Moore’s
laws empirical prediction continues to be followed, in the coming decades the size of a single
transistorwill gettothe smallestpossiblesize as shown inFigure1.6, reachingsizescomparable
with few atoms making it not possible to realize due to completely different properties of the
commonly used materials at that physical scale [38, 42–44].

Figure 1.6: Prediction about the future single transistor size by the empirical Moore’s law.
The exponential rise of the number of transistors inside an integrated circuit per year show in

wire widths and displayed in logarithm scale as function of year. The pink and blue points
are common time transistor size, while future size predictions are shown by the black dashed
lines. The graph shows that the physical limits of atomic size will be reached between 2040
and 2050. Figure taken from [38].
In fact, in that future atomic dimension device quantum mechanics has a dominant role
and quantum tunneling will make it difficult to prevent the electrons from moving freely
between the drain and the source of the transistor. Consequently, the device will not be
able to control the current flowing in it. Therefore it will no longer function as a transistor
should. Hence new ways of increasing computational power should be found either in new
technological innovations like for example with the introduction of carbon nanotube field-effect
transistors [45] or by considering new computational means that are not based on classical
physics [44, 46].
1.3 Quantum computing, a new opportunity to explore
In 1981 in a keynote speech [47] Richard Feynman contemplated the possibility of studying
nature through simulations in a more natural way with an hypothetical computational hard-
ware able to study a large system using an amount of resources proportional to the system
16

--- PAGE 32 ---
volume and, that its internal functioning was directly based on the laws of quantum mechanics
that are the ultimate laws describing nature in its microscopic essence. In subsequent work
[48] he began to advocate for the development of a quantum computer by actively proposing
what and how its building blocks should be. As creator of the path integral formulation
of quantum mechanics, (a formulation equivalent to the canonical approach to quantum
mechanics that uses the Schrodinger equation to study the time evolution of a quantum
system [49, 50]), he was deeply interested in the study of real time dynamics of a quantum
system. In this respect he was concerned about the unreasonable attempts to study highly
entangled quantum systems, such as those typical of particle or condensed matter physics,
on a classical computer because this would inevitably require an exponential increase in the
amount of classical computational resources, making the task practically unfeasible.
Why should we consider quantum computers?
The reason is simple. In a quantum computer the fundamental computational element
is represented by the qubit, the quantum version of a classical bit. While a bit can only take
a 0 or 1 value at a time, the qubit being an object respecting the laws of quantum mechanics
can be not only in the states |0⟩or|1⟩but simultaneously in any superposition of these
two states, a|0⟩+b|1⟩with aandbtwo complex numbers whose only requirement is that
|a|2+|b|2= 1needed to respect the probabilistic interpretation.
This means, that measuring a bit always return one value, 0or1, with absolute certainty,
while a qubit can be found 100%in one of the two states or can be simultaneously in both
states with a certain probability.
To be more concrete, Nbits can represent up to 2Nnumbers but only one of these can be
stored in the memory at a time. Instead considering Nqubits the hardware can store a
superposition of all states at one time.
This has an important consequence. If we now consider Nqubits these can be in any su-
perposition, so a quantum hardware with Nqubits is able to encode a superposition of 2N
states using only Nqubits. This makes it possible to directly consider the Hamiltonian
formulation of a theory, something that is not possible to study on a classical computer due
to the computational exponential growing cost with the Hamiltonian size.
Indeed, the Hamiltonian formulation of a system with Nparticles has a number of states
that grows exponentially with the number of particles. If the particles are spin-1/2 it grows
as2Nand a classical computer requires 2Nmemory slots to deal with the system. Therefore
using only a few tens of particles makes the computation completely exorbitant in terms of
memory resources and computational time. Exactly for this reason the lattice gauge theory
approach was based on the Monte Carlo importance sampling method.
Conversely, a quantum computer needs only Nqubits. This means that a quantum computer
can make possible to do calculations in the Hamiltonain formalism. In fact, a quantum
computer has the potential to be exponentially more efficient than a classical computer,
because it can store a theory Hilbert space using a number of quantum resources that scale
polynomially with the number of particles.
It is this exponential efficiency that gives one the possibility to use the Hamiltonian formu-
17

--- PAGE 33 ---
lation of a theory that is completely free of the sign problem limitations, hence quantum
computers are expected to dramatically expand our computational approach to understand
the fundamental laws of nature.
In point of fact, a fault-tolerant quantum computer will offer a new possibility to study
not only Quantum Chromodynamics but all non-perturbative phenomena of lattice gauge
theories which are not possible to study numerically today using the standard Monte Carlo
method due to the occurrence of the sign problem.
Among the fields that will become computationally achievable are the studies of strong
interacting matter in the presence of chemical potential, which is relevant to studying the
matter of the early universe, the core of a neutron star, and it will certainly expand our
understanding of the QCD phase diagram. The real-time dynamics of lattice gauge theory
will become accessible and this will make it possible to simulate the dynamics of a heavy-ion
collision currently at RHIC and LHC, creating the possibility to compare the results and,
guide future experiments towards interesting parameter regions where a sign of possible
physics beyond the Standard Model could materialize.
However, we should keep our enthusiasm tempered because those fascinating future studies
are not yet possible on currently available quantum computers because they are not yet fault-
tolerant, they are still noisy, lack error correction, and have small-scale quantum resources, we
are in fact in the "Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum" (NISQ) era as John Preskill defined
it [51]. Hence, as for the last 6-7 years and maybe for the next decades, only theories on
small lattice sizes can be studied and error mitigation techniques have to be applied to reduce
errors and in general quantum resources must be highly rationalized to keep the noise level as
low as possible.
These current technical limitations that force researchers to mainly study simplified theories on
small lattices are nevertheless beneficial, because they stimulate a deeper understanding of the
theory that could lead to the development of new approaches. Furthermore, the development
of new quantum algorithms and their use on quantum hardware allows the research community
to gain experience in quantum simulation, and ultimately take the opportunity to drive future
hardware development toward the needs of the community, similarly to what happened with
the development of supercomputers.
1.3.1 The need for error mitigation techniques
The main challenge of using the presently available NISQ era quantum hardware is the
necessity of dealing with the noisy hardware due to the imperfect realization that generates
results littered with errors and effectively hampering the usefulness of this new technology
[52]. This is a temporary problem that should be solved with technological improvement,
in fact from the theoretical point of view the quantum threshold theorem proves that once
the hardware noise is reduced under a threshold level the quantum hardware can be as
fault-tolerant as a classical computer [53].
The main error sources affecting the NISQ hardware are the qubit interaction with the
18

--- PAGE 34 ---
hardware, known as qubit decoherence; the imperfect action of gates, known as gate error;
and errors made in reading the qubit state, measurement error.
In contrast to the classical hardware where error correction can be implemented using
some kind of data redundancy, basically by copying the data, anything similar to the classical
case cannot be realized on quantum hardware, where copying a generic state is forbidden by
the non-cloning theorem [54, 55]. There have been a few error correction algorithms made
available in the last few decades to take care of qubits decoherence like the Shor algorithm
[56], the bit-flip algorithm [57], Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill algorithm [58], the surface code
[59] and a few others. But in general, these algorithms require hardware with a larger number
of qubits and a greater qubit connectivity than those available today. For example, the Shor’s
code needs 9 auxiliary qubits for each original qubit to keep free from decoherence.
Therefore, while waiting for better and more powerful hardware with robust inbuilt er-
ror correction capabilities, the user is left to troubleshoot by developing error mitigation
techniques that can extend the usability of the current hardware by reducing the effects of
the hardware errors on the measured data.
1.3.2 A brief overview of the literature on quantum computing
In the last 40 years since the first talk by Feynman and the independent work by Yuri
Manin [60] and Paul Benioff [61], the scientific community has expressed a growing interest
in the field and consequently produced a vast literature mainly dedicated to developing
algorithms and speculating on how a quantum computer should be. Only in the last 6-7 years,
the opportunity to use actual quantum computers, sometimes with free open access, has
shifted the interest of researchers toward the direct implementation of LGT on the available
quantum hardware, populating the literature with first results of quantum simulations using
actual quantum hardware.
Hence, a succinct description of the historical literature is provided mainly to works that
were considered useful to understand the growing field and motivate our interest in quantum
computing, while a more detailed account of the literature related to the study of lattice
gauge theory is provided, and the contribution of our two works [62, 63] to the literature
is shown. Nevertheless, here there is no intention of giving a comprehensive and complete
account of the whole quantum computing field not even of the part related to lattice gauge
theories.
In recent years many important contributions devoted to underlining the importance and
the effectiveness of the development of quantum computers have been proposed, and here
we give a chronological account. One of the first crucial works that showed how powerful a
hypothetical quantum computer can be, is the one by Peter Shor [64] where the first account
of how an algorithm for a quantum computer can perform exponentially better than a classical
computer, for the concrete example of factorizing an integer in its prime factors.
Another important contribution was the one by Seth Lloyd that showed that a hypothetical
quantum computer can efficiently simulate the dynamics of quantum mechanical system [65],
19

--- PAGE 35 ---
effectively confirming Feynman’s conjecture.
Regarding the properties that a hardware implementation should have to be considered
a quantum computer David P. DiVincenzo proposed a list of criteria [66], which guided
researchers in developing actual hardware and are now commonly called the 7 DiVincenzo’s
criteria.
An important result toward the realization of quantum hardware was the proof of the
quantum threshold theorem, that ensures that a fault-tolerant quantum hardware can be
obtained once the hardware noise is reduced under a threshold level making the quantum
hardware as fault-tolerant as a classical computer [52, 53, 67].
For the development of the field of lattice gauge theory on quantum computers the work by
Tim Byrnes and Yoshihisa Yamamoto was fundamental to developing the path for future
studies by describing how to approach quantum simulations of U(1),SU(2)andSU(3)[68].
A first comprehensive review of possible realizations of quantum hardware and on the
possibilities and prospectives of the impact of quantum simulations in many fields of physics
was reported by the authors of Ref. [69], and one of the first comprehensive textbooks on
quantum computing by Nielsen and Chuang [70] is now well known in the field as an important
study reference.
Strictly related to the field of lattice gauge theories using one dimensional lattice, the
first study of a lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer was reported in [71] a pioneering
work where the real time dynamics of a one dimensional Schwinger model was studied on
a trapped-ion quantum hardware, and after this milestone many other studies using a one
dimensional lattice gauge theory using quantum hardware followed first using U(1) in [72–
78], Z(2) lattice gauge theory [79–81], Dn[82, 83], SU(2) lattice gauge theory [84, 85] and
SU(3) lattice gauge theory [86–90]. We contribute to the field by performing the first study
of part of the energy spectrum and the time evolution of SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a
quantumannealer[62]and, thestudyofaSU(2)latticeonagate-basedquantumcomputer[63].
While for the case of lattice gauge theories on a (2+1) dimensional lattice no direct study on
quantum hardware has been reported yet for more than a few plaquettes due to the shortage
of quantum resources on the available quantum hardware, but instead many researchers have
developed resource-efficient protocols that could be used in future hardware [91–99].
Regarding the possibility to implement error correction techniques since those historical
crucial algorithms are at the moment too expensive on the current hardware, many researchers
have developed error mitigation techniques [72, 81, 82, 87, 89, 90, 100–105], and we contribute
to the field with the introduction of an error mitigation technique named Self-mitigation [63].
A few very interesting recent reviews of quantum computing for lattice gauge theory are
already present in the literature [106–111].
20

--- PAGE 36 ---
Finally, for a mindful motivating and historical account of the importance of quantum
computing and its potential contributions to particle physics the many contributions by
John Preskill to the quantum computing literature created in the last three decades are very
inspiring [51, 112–118], and especially its latest report on the overall historical perspective of
the entire industry over the past 40 years [119].
1.4 Structure of this thesis
The origin of this thesis is grounded in the willingness to learn how to use the available
quantum hardware to study particle physics phenomena that can be access by numerical
calculation though direct computer calculation or by computer simulations. This approach of
learning by doing using minimal lattice gauge theory models was contemporary shared by
other research groups with a background in LQCD, in the interlude until better and more
powerful quantum hardware able to host a full theory on large lattice size are developed.
The thesis structure reflects the chronological development of the research, from the choice of
the SU(2) theory as a first step toward the future goal of simulating SU(3), the gauge group
on which QCD is based, to the strategies implemented and the results obtained in using two
different open-access quantum hardware.
In chapter 2 we present all the introductory material necessary to carry out the study of SU(2)
pure gauge theory by presenting all the analytical derivation needed for the simulations and
discussingthetheoryenergyspectrumandtimeevolutioncalculatedusingaclassicalcomputer.
In chapter 3 we first present the D-Wave quantum annealer and discuss how to use the
hardware to find the ground state of a theory. The numerical strategies and algorithms used
to investigate the energy spectrum and the time evolution are described, and finally we discuss
the numerical results for the energy spectrum and the time evolution of the SU(2) pure gauge
lattice theory. This work was done in collaboration with Sarmed A Rahman, Randy Lewis
and Sarah Powell and it was published in Phys. Rev. D [62].
In chapter 4 after presenting the IBM gate-base quantum hardware we investigated how to
use the hardware by implementing it onto the time evolution of the theory and dealing with
the hardware errors. This work was done in collaboration with Sarmed A Rahman, Randy
Lewis and Sarah Powell and it was published in Phys. Rev. D [63].
Finally, in the concluding chapter, after a summary of the results of the entire thesis, a
critical comparison between the two hardwares used is provided together with a general
perspective for the future use of quantum computers in the field of lattice gauge theory.

Chapter 2
SU(2) lattice gauge theory
In this chapter we present the SU(2) pure gauge lattice theory studied, by presenting its
Hamiltonian, the operators present therein and demonstrate how to find the physical states of
the system used to represent it. In the last part we discuss the theory for a minimal lattice by
deriving the physical states, the Hamiltonian representation and discuss the energy spectrum
of the theory and its time evolution, pointing out some interesting physical phenomena like
travelling excitation and the behaviour of the theory with truncation of the Hilbert space.
The Hamiltonian for SU(2) lattice gauge theory was proposed by Kogut and Susskind
in 1974 [120] and takes into account both the pure gauge part and the massive fermion part.
In this thesis as a first fundamental step we concentrated our interest only in the pure gauge
part leaving the massive fermion part for a future study, therefore only a derivation for the
pure gauge part is presented in Appendix A.
In this respect, many recent articles addressed SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the context of
quantum computing [68, 106, 121–133] but none of them used the available quantum hardware
as they are limited and noisy. The first simulation of SU(2) pure gauge theory on a quantum
computer was done in 2019 by [84] and, it is important to mention that while we were working
on [62], the first work simulating the full SU(2) theory with fermions on a quantum computer
appeared in the literature in 2021 [85].
Our approach is mostly close to the treatment of [68, 84, 134] and here we follow the notation
by Byrnes and Yamamoto in Ref. [68].
When presenting a lattice gauge theory an important role is played by the space-time
discretization. In our study that uses the Hamiltonian formalism the time is continuous while
the space is discretized by using a single link joining two points in space as a primitive element
on which the SU(2) gauge field Uresides. The link length ais conventionally set to 1, a= 1.
These links are arranged in groups of four to form squares called plaquettes. A plaquette
is the base element, and it is used to map the entire space by simply joining many of them
together as shown in Figure 2.1:

1Figure 2.1: The lattice notation is: a link is denoted by a line connecting two nodes indicated
by black dots. From left to right we have a single link, a plaquette, a row of plaquettes and a
square of plaquettes. A row of plaquettes can be used to map a 1-dimensional lattice while
the square of plaquettes can be used to map a 2-dimensional lattice.
In the works presented in this thesis we considered a minimal one-dimensional lattice made
by a few plaquettes arranged in a row, with periodic or closed boundary conditions depending
on the specific study. This choice was motivated by carefully considering the hardware noise
and the shortage of quantum resource in the NISQ quantum hardware.
2.1 SU(2) Hamiltonian and the operators
We can start by first presenting the Hamiltonian and describing the action of the operators
therein and successively formalizing their properties using the SU(2) group property. The
interested reader can find in Appendix B a derivation of the pure gauge lattice theory
Hamiltonian from the SU(2) pure gauge Lagrangian.
For clarity let’s picture a generic row-lattice composed by four plaquettes with periodic
boundary condition as shown Figure 2.2:

Figure 2.2: A 4-plaquette lattice with periodic boundary condition in the longitudinal direction.
The lattice is composed by 4 plaquettes made by the union of 12 gauge links which are joined
by 8 nodes. Each plaquette is indicated by the label in the center of each square, each link by
the letter at the middle point, and each node by the closest number.
The SU(2) pure gauge Hamiltonian considered is:
ˆH=g2
2 X
i=linksˆE2
i−2xX
i=plaquettesˆ□i!
(2.1)
where the only free parameter is the gauge coupling constant g, or the more convenient
parameter x≡2/g4. The first term in ˆH,ˆEiis the square of the chromoelectric field operator
23

--- PAGE 39 ---
whose action is to globally quantify the stored chromoelectric energy on the lattice by each
link. The second term is the chromomagnetic term that contains the plaquette operator
ˆ□iwhose action is to add or subtract fluxes of energy on the ithlattice plaquette. This
Hamiltonian can be derived from the pure gauge SU(2) Lagrangian as it is shown in Appendix
A.
A more formal definition of the operators in connection with the SU(2) group properties is
important to settle the discussion in a more insightful way. In this respect we adapt the
discussion from [68].
To discretize the space let’s fix a reference frame at each lattice site rand label the link as in
Figure 2.3:
U(r,µ)•r•r+µU†(r+ν,µ)
•r+ν•r+µ+ν
U†(r,µ) U(r+µ,ν)
ν
µ
Figure 2.3: A single plaquette where all the links are labelled starting from the lattice site
r going counterclockwise by using the two unit vectors µandνexpressing the two possible
space directions.
On each link of the lattice we define a gauge link operator as 2×2matrix ˆU(r, µ)with
the two end points oriented along the unit vector µand the canonically conjugate operators
ˆE(r, µ)α, where for α=a, b, cwe have the three color components of field respecting the
SU(2) Lie algebra [ˆEa,ˆEb] =iϵabcˆEc.
The theory is quantized by imposing the following commutation relation at each lattice site:
hˆE(x)α,ˆU(x)i
=1
2σαˆU(x),
hˆE(x)α,ˆU(x)†i
=−1
2ˆU(x)†σα, (2.2)
where σα(α= 1,2,3)are the three SU(2) generators, the Pauli matrices.
The operators commute if they are at different lattice site.
The three ˆE(x)αcomponents can be used to define ˆE2= (ˆEa)2+ (ˆEb)2+ (ˆEc)2as the
local gauge-invariant quadratic Casimir operator of SU(2).
To further characterize these operators we need to understand how they act on the link
state, but first we need to define a basis to represent a link state. A possibility is to represent
the state of each link composing the lattice by using one of the possible infinite countable
SU(2) irreducible representations jwith (j= 0,1
2,1,3
2,2. . .)and two SU(2) projections m, m′
with (m, m′=−j,−j+ 1, . . . , j )to express the two link ends. The link state is indicated as
|j, m, m′⟩. This approach is called angular momentum formulation of a SU(2) lattice gauge
24

--- PAGE 40 ---
theory.
Using the angular momentum formulation the operators Uand ˆE2act on link states as [68]:
ˆUs,s′|j, m, m′⟩=j+1
2X
J=j−1
2r

J, M′|j, m′;1
2, s′
|J, M, M′⟩(2.3)
which has a non-vanishing contribution only for M=m+sandM′=m′+s′. This means
that if the conditions on the projection are met the link operator is able to change the link
state by a ±1
2unit of angular momentum.
Since ˆE2is the Casimir operator it acts on the link state as:
ˆE2|j, m, m′⟩=j(j+ 1)|j, m, m′⟩ (2.4)
where |j, m, m′⟩is an eigenstate of ˆE2with eigenvalue j(j+ 1)which is interpreted as the
chromoelectric energy stored in the link.
The last operator present in the Hamiltonian is the plaquette operator. It is the sim-
plest gauge invariant operator made by taking the trace of product of the four link operators
placed around a plaquette as shown in Figure 2.3:
ˆ□= Tr[ ˆU(r, µ)ˆU(r+µ, ν)ˆU†(r+ν, µ)ˆU†(r, ν)]. (2.5)
Because the plaquette operator contains four link operators, it can change the state of each of
the four links by ±1
2unit of angular momentum. The variation of each link state is acceptable
only if the angular momentum composition rule holds at each of the four plaquette nodes.
2.2Deriving the states and the Hamiltonian representa-
tion
Considering a generic 1-dimensional lattice made of a row of plaquettes as in Figure 2.2,
we chose to characterize the states of the system using a global basis, in which the state of
each link composing the lattice is expressed in the angular momentum basis |j, m, m′⟩and
are normalized as ⟨l, n, n′|j, m, m′⟩=δljδm′mδn′n.
With this choice, a generic state of the system for a lattice like the one in Figure 2.2 can be
written as a direct product of each link state as:
|ψ⟩=|jA, mA, m′
A⟩|jB, mB, m′
B⟩. . .|jL, mL, m′
L⟩. (2.6)
The state so labelled is a physically allowed state of the system only if at each lattice node
the SU(2) Gauss’s law holds. This implies that in constructing the physical states one has to
ensure that the links joining at each node respect the angular momentum composition rule.
It is important to note that even on a lattice made by a finite number of plaquettes, the
Hilbert space is infinite because SU(2) is a continuous symmetry, therefore the associated
25

--- PAGE 41 ---
Hamiltonian energy spectrum must be truncated at a certain energy value. However once
the theory is truncated it has a finite number of states and it can be encoded using a finite
classical or quantum computer memory. In this approach the full theory is approximated
by successively increasing the energy truncation j. A larger jtruncation adds new states to
those already present in the previous, smaller jtruncation. Therefore the truncation rationale
can be evaluated by the agreement of the expectation value of an operator of interest between
successive truncations.
For future exploration not only of this specific Hamiltonian but also for an SU(2) non-
abelian LGT with and without fermions one has to keep in mind that there are other ways
to truncate the Hilbert space by using a different formulation. The authors of Ref. [131]
have thoroughly explored different formulations for SU(2) LGT reporting advantages and
disadvantages of the most common formulations from the physics and computational point of
view.
To begin constructing the Hilbert space we have to identify the vacuum state, which could be
defined as the state for which all the links are set to the j= 0SU(2) representation, that
means that no chromoelectric energy flux is present on the lattice, that reads:
ˆE2|vacuum ⟩= 0 (2.7)
The excited states can be generated by applying any combination of plaquette operators to
the vacuum. There is no limitation to how many plaquette operators can be applied, therefore
to avoid dealing with an infinite number of states a truncation as to be introduced. The one
adopted in this thesis is to limit the allowed jvalue of the SU(2) irreducible representation
for each of the link states composing the system state to a fixed jmaxvalue.
Once the truncation value jmaxis chosen, the states generated can be used to find the
Hamiltonian representation by simply calculating the contribution of the chromoelectric and
chromomagnetic parts.
The chromoelectric operator matrix elements are:
⟨ψfinal|X
iˆE2
i|ψinitial⟩=LX
i=Aji(ji+ 1)δfinal,initial. (2.8)
which is diagonal, and the eigenvalues are the total chromoelectric energy stored on the lattice.
The chromomagnetic matrix elements are more involved and have a specific contribution
coming from each plaquette. The contribution of a generic plaquette is derived in Appendix
26

--- PAGE 42 ---
B, while here we show the result for plaquette 1 of Figure 2.2:
⟨ψfinal|ˆ□1|ψinitial⟩=(−1)jA+JE+jIp

(2.9)
where jiandJiare the j value for |ψinitial⟩and|ψfinal⟩, respectively. Its contribution is non
zero only if all the links in |ψinitial⟩and|ψfinal⟩external to the acting plaquette have the same
values, which is clear by looking to Eq. B.12. The four curly brackets are 6j symbols whose
role is to enforce Gauss’s law automatically at each node. Their numerical value is typically a
square root of ratios and are provided in Appendix B. Notice that |ψinitial⟩and|ψfinal⟩will
never be the same state because applying a plaquette operator necessarily changes each of
those four gauge links by ±1
2. Therefore all plaquette terms are off diagonal.
Finally the Hamiltonian matrix elements for the lattice in Figure 2.2 are:
⟨ψfinal|ˆH|ψinitial⟩=LX
i=Aji(ji+ 1)δfinal,initial−2x4X
i=1⟨ψfinal|ˆ□i|ψinitial⟩.(2.10)
There are three important observation.
The Hamiltonian chromoelectric and chromomagnetic contribution depends only on the j
SU(2) irreducible representation and not on the two projections at the end of each link m
andm′. This observation motivated the change of the entire lattice state notation from
|ψ⟩=|jA, mA, m′
A⟩|jB, mB, m′
B⟩. . .|jL, mL, m′
L⟩to simply |ψ⟩=|jA, jB, . . . , j L⟩and most
important, enlighten toward the development of a simple algorithm to generate the allowed
physical states given the lattice shape and the chosen jmaxtruncation. This algorithm was
used to generate the physical states for the Hamiltonian representations of the different
lattice configurations present in this thesis. Its description in pseudocode and one calculation
example was provided in Appendix C.
The Hamiltonian has two regimes. In the strong coupling regime, g2→ ∞ (x→0), the
chromomagnetic contribution is negligible and therefore the Hamiltonian closely coincides with
the chromoelectric part therefore it is almost diagonal in the lattice states and these states
are quasi-stationary. In the weak coupling regime, g2→0 (x→ ∞ ), the chromomagnetic
term dominates hence the eigenstates are now linear combinations of the chromoelectric
states. Therefore many possible energetic transitions are possible between the chromoelectric
states. In the intermediate case where 0< x < 1the chromoelectric eigenstates are mildly
affected by the chromomagnetic term creating a dynamics in which low-energy, single plaquette
excitations, are traveling across the lattice.
27

--- PAGE 43 ---
Since the Hamiltonian is not always diagonal in the lattice basis used, it is tempting to
numerically diagonalize it. There are two good reasons not to succumb to this temptation:
Numerical diagonalization hides the symmetries that are present and can be made evident by
considering block diagonalization based on the system symmetries. Additionally, there are
already quantum hardware built with the scope of finding the ground state in mind, as will be
discussed in Chapter 2. Secondly, if we look toward the future when quantum computers will
be fault-tolerant and have abundant quantum resources, there will be no need to diagonalize
the Hamiltonian on a classical computer. Using quantum hardware, like the one discussed in
Chapter 2 or implementing a quantum algorithm like the variational quantum eigensolver
(VQE) [135] to find the the eigenstates in a more efficient way and for a larger Hamiltonian
than can be feasibly diagonalized using classical computer. For the present we should explore
the potentiality of the available quantum resources by using only minimal assistance from the
classical computer.
2.3 2-plaquette jmax= 1/2
To make the theory more tangible, it is useful to consider a concrete example that
summarizes the approach used to study the system dynamics on different lattices and with
different jtruncations.
Let’s consider the minimal case of a two plaquettes lattice with closed boundary conditions
and work out how to derive the system states, discuss the time evolution and the effect of the
truncation on the energy spectrum. The Hamiltonian for this case reads:
ˆH=g2
2 X
i=linksˆE2
i−2x
ˆ□L+ˆ□R!
(2.11)
We adopt an energy truncation of jmax= 1/2implying that the link state can only have
j= 0,j= 1/2or a superposition of the two.
In this case the four allowed basis states are present in Figure 4.13:
Figure 2.4: The four possible states available on the 2-plaquette lattice after the jmax= 1/2
truncation. Each solid line means a j= 1/2flux of energy is present, while the dashed line a
j= 0meaning no energy is present. If all the links of a plaquette have j= 1/2we label the
plaquette as switched “on”, otherwise the plaquette is switched “off”.
It is worth discussing how the states depicted in Figure 2.4 can be actually obtained, and
because the system is minimal how this can be done without using the algorithm in Appendix
C. We start with the vacuum and obtain the second state by applying the left plaquette
operator ˆ□Lon the vacuum, obtaining a j= 1/2energy flux on the left plaquette. If the
left plaquette is now applied to the realized state, the second state, we obtain two states:
28

--- PAGE 44 ---
one having all the links with j= 0that is the vacuum, and the other with j= 1flux in
the left plaquette, which cannot be accepted because we fixed the truncation to jmax= 1/2.
Notice that these two jvalues are simply obtained by the angular momentum composing rule,
1
2⊗1
2= 0⊕1.
Similarly, the third state is obtained by applying the right plaquette operator ˆ□ron the
vacuum obtaining a 1/2on the right plaquette.
Finally, the fourth state is obtained by applying both plaquettes on the vacuum. This should
be done carefully by taking care of the angular momentum composition rule at the center
vertical link, which now receives two contributions. We obtain two states: one in which both
plaquettes contribute a j= 1/2in all the links, resulting with the vertical center link state
having a j= 1value, which cannot be accepted due to the jmax= 1/2truncation. The other
state is obtained by having a flux of j= 1/2in all the links except the vertical center link
that has a j= 0value, which is fourth state.
These four states in notation used so far |ja, jb, jc, jd, je, jf, jg⟩are:

Since this notation is quite cumbersome we change it to one that closely represents a miniature

, where the capital letters are A= 2jA+ 1and are used to have
only integer values.
Using these four states and the relations provided for the operators in the previous sec-
tion the Hamiltonian representation is:
ˆH=g2
2
0−2x−2x0
−2x3 0 −x
−2x0 3 −x

This is enough to consider some physics phenomena. For example by considering the
real-time evolution of the theory and calculating the probability that starting with the left
plaquette switched “on”, one finds that the left or the right plaquette will be switched “on”
after a certain time.
The Hamiltonian has two regimes, one for large xand one for small x. For x < 1the
Hamiltonian off-diagonal elements whose presence is due to the chromomagnetic operator are
small. Therefore the dominant states are weakly coupled chromoelectric eigenstates. In this
regime, the single-plaquette states will move across the lattice as shown in Figure 2.5.

both panels the small diagrams using the notation of Figure 4.13 indicate the system state.
The plots show the decrease of the excitation propagation time with the increasing of xin
the range x <1.
A traveling exitation is the interpretation of the phenomena present in the left panel of
Figure 2.5 where for x <1the probability of having an energy flux in the left plaquette (red
curve) drops from 100%at time t= 0to close to 0 %at time t= 240while the probability of
right plaquette (blue curve) does the opposite. Similarly in the right panel, the now larger
value of xsuperimposes some high frequencies. That the excitation propagation time is
shorter for larger xis clearly visible by comparing the pseudo-period of the left panel at
x= 0.1with the one present in the right panel at x= 0.6.
The phenomena shown here on a larger lattice is interpreted as an only-energy particle a so
called SU(2) glueball propagating into space.
Forx >1the chromomagnetic contribution dominates mixing of the single-plaquette states.
This is evident by the presence of many higher frequencies superimposed to the single-plaquette
transitions in Figure 2.6.

At larger values of x, higher frequencies are present as can be seen moving from the left

Finally, in this section we should briefly discuss the effect of the jtruncation on the system
by considering a relevant observable and investigate how it changes by considering larger j
values. In Figure 2.7 it is shown how the four jmax= 1/2energy eigenvalues versus x= 2/g4
are changed by considering larger jvalues.

Figure 2.7: The four lowest energy levels for the 2-plaquette lattice with closed boundary
conditions Hamiltonian for various jtruncation versus x. In the range of xconsidered rapid
convergence is observed.
The plot shows that the effect of the jtruncation is relevant for all four j= 1/2states
and its effect grows with the value of x, but it is more prevalent on the excited states than
on the ground state. What it is important to notice is the rapid convergence in the xrange
considered among different jvalues larger than j= 1/2, and by j= 2precise results are
clearly obtained.
The impact of a larger jtruncation will have effect on the time evolution too. The plots in
Figure 2.7 will not look much different because a larger jtruncation has more states and
many more off-diagonal elements contributing with more higher frequencies in the range
x >1. Instead it is interesting to see that the traveling excitations in Figure 2.5 are still
present, but the excitation propagation time is larger as can be seen in Figure 2.8. This
is explained by noticing that a larger jtruncation has just more states, and in the range
31

--- PAGE 47 ---
x <1the off-diagonal elements are negligible, leaving all the larger number of chromoelectric
eigenstates to contribute to the time evolution of a single state.

plot confirms that traveling exicitation are SU(2) phenomena and not an artefact of small j
truncation.
The plot in Figure 2.8 clearly shows the interesting physical phenomena of a travelling
excitation is not an artefact due to a small truncation but instead it is clear distinct phenomena
of the SU(2) pure gauge lattice theory considered.
A similar phenomena was found in a study conducted using U(1)lattice gauge theory by the
authors of Ref. [136].
2.4 Toward the use of quantum computing
To conclude this chapter we look forward to using quantum computing to reproduce the
study presented in the last section by asking:
Can a quantum computer be used to extract the energy spectrum and the time evolu-
tion of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory?
We will answer this questions in the following two chapters by encoding the Hamiltonian
representation and the time evolution operator on the two chosen quantum hardwares: the
D-Wave quantum annealer [137] and the IBM superconducting gate-based quantum hardware
[138].
32

--- PAGE 48 ---
Given the limitations of the noisy and small scale quantum hardware, two main simpli-
fications will be adopted: first we will consider a minimal lattice made of a single row of
plaquettes, limiting the study of the energy spectrum to lattices made from 2-plaquettes to
6-plaquettes and considering up to a j= 3/2truncation on D-Wave, leaving the larger values
ofjto future studies. While for the real-time evolution on D-Wave and IBM a 2-plaquette
lattice with a j= 1/2truncation is used by studying the probability of transition between
excited states.
33

--- PAGE 49 ---
Chapter 3
SU(2) on the D-Wave quantum annealer
In this chapter1we present the main features of the D-Wave quantum annealer and show
how the hardware can be used to extract the energy spectrum of SU(2) pure gauge theory for
the case of 2-plaquette lattices with jmax= 1/2,1,and 3 /2and, 4 and 6 plaquettes lattices
with jmax= 1/2using periodic boundary conditions. The results are, overall, in perfect
agreement with the exact classical results without using any error mitigation techniques.
Then to study the time evolution of the theory we show how to implement a method called
Kitaev-Feynman clock state and use it to calculate the real-time oscillation between two
excited states, obtaining results in agreement with the exact classical result. Finally, we
conclude the chapter by discussing the overall results and looking forward to possible future
extensions.
3.1 The D-Wave quantum annealer
The company D-Wave Systems Inc. [137] founded in 1999 is based in British Columbia,
Canada. In the last 24 years of activity it has developed 5 versions of a quantum annealer,
which is a special type of quantum computer that exploits quantum fluctuations in the system
to find the solutions to a given problem by using the adiabatic theorem [139–142].
The D-Wave quantum annealer (DW) hardware used for the result presented in this chapter
is now the second-last version the D-Wave Advantage, that has 5760 physical qubits arranged
into the hardware using the Pegasus architecture, where each qubit is connected to 15 other
qubits. It is important to emphasize that many physical qubits have to be coupled together
to form a logical qubit, which is the fundamental entity capable of performing a computation.
The hardware is designed to find the ground state of an Ising-like Hamiltonian, better
known in the quantum computing field as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
1The results presented in this chapter were previously published in Phys. Rev. D 104, 034501 done in
collaboration with S. A Rahman, R. Lewis and S. Powell.

--- PAGE 50 ---
(QUBO):
H(q) =NX
i=1hiqi+NX
i=1NX
j=i+1Jijqiqj (3.1)
where qican be 0 or 1, while hiandJijare real valued coefficients chosen by the user.
Therefore any problem that can be directly mapped into QUBO can be submitted to the
hardware in matrix form, and the DW’s Ocean software [143] has the role of embedding the
problems on the actual qubits present on the hardware by creating a graph that represents
the problem as a connection between qubits. The solution to a given problem is given in
terms of a vector containing the state of the qubits and the energy associated with the qubits
configuration.
From the operative point of view, the DW hardware is able to solve the problem of finding the
ground state by performing an adiabatic evolution starting from an initial Hamiltonian already
present on the hardware to the one representing the user’s problem. Whenever a problem is
submitted, the DW hardware works on the following transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian:
H(q, s) =A(s)"NX
i=1qx
i#
+B(s)"NX
i=1hiqz
i+NX
i=1NX
j=i+1Jijqz
iqz
j#
(3.2)
where the first term multiplied by A(s)is the initial prepared Hamiltonian with qubits aligned
along xdue to the transverse field, so that initially all the qubits are arranged into an equal
superposition with respect to the zbasis. This initial configuration is crucial to make every
possible solution to the user’s problem equally reachable. The second term multiplied by
B(s)is the problem submitted by the user with qubits aligned along z. To find the ground
state of the user’s problem, the two annealing functions A(s)andB(s)are defined such that
during the annealing time interval ta, with the growing of the time parameter s=t/ta,A(s)
slowly decreases from 1 to 0, while B(s)slowly increases from 0 to 1, allowing the system
to transition from the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian to the one from the user’s
problem [144]. The correctness of this process is guaranteed by adiabatic theorem, which
under the general hypothesis assures that if the transformation from the initial to the final
Hamiltonian is slow enough, the initial ground state will evolve into the ground state of the
final Hamiltonian [145–147]. The annealing time can also be tuned starting from the default
value of 20 microseconds.
Since the connectivity of a qubit with the others is limited by the material connections
present on the hardware’s structure, a problem that requires a large qubit connectivity is
embedded by connecting more qubits together using a chain term that forces those qubits to be
in the same state by activating an extra Hamiltonian interaction of the form δH=−Jchainσz
jσz
k
among those qubits. Those qubits connected by a chain are forming a logic qubit now having
a larger connectivity to suit the needs of a specific problem. DW’s feature of increasing the
qubit’s connectivity on a case-by-case basis is a powerful feature because the system has the
flexibility to choose from a few qubits being connected to all-to-all qubits connectivity.
The down side of this feature is that the chain strength value Jchainhas to be set by the user
35

--- PAGE 51 ---
in a rational way. In fact, if the chain strength value is too small relative to the terms in the
problem Hamiltonian, the system cannot hold the qubits forming a logic qubit to be aligned
to the same state, causing a breaking of the chain and the incorrect encoding of the problem,
while instead when it is too large, the chain term Hamiltonian changes the physics of the
problem.
Therefore the user has to submit a few runs changing the value of the chain to be sure that
the system is solving the correct problem, and in case of a chain breaking event repeat the run
with a larger value of the chain, or accept the correction to the problem with chain breaking
provided by the Ocean software.
The DW applicability can appear to be rather limited but in reality there is a long list
of problems that can be reformulated as an Ising Hamiltonian like many NP-complete and
NP-Hard problems such as partitioning problems like number or graph partitioning, binary
integer linear programming problem,covering and packing problems, optimization problem
defined by inequalities like the Knapsack problem, or the well known traveling salesman
problem and many more as shown by the author of [148], but not all of these problems have
already been fully explored on DW.
In the event that a problem or a physical system is representable only by a Hamiltonian
that cannot be directly mapped into a Ising like Hamiltonian, the authors of Ref. [149–153]
working in the field of computational chemistry developed an algorithm called Quantum
Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) that maps the ground state variational problem onto an Ising
problem, resulting in the possibility to use the DW hardware to find the ground state of any
Hamiltonian by using the following functional:
F≡ ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩ −λ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ (3.3)
where His the Hamiltonian of the system under investigation and the parameter λis an
extra Lagrange multiplier that has to be tuned by the user to avoid the trivial null solution
|ψ⟩=|0⟩and to find the minimum possible value for the eigenvalue and the corresponding
eigenvector.
A similar approach can be used to extract the excited states by introducing, extra Lagrange
multipliers to the function above to exclude the lower states from the state solution.
Furthermore, to explore the possibility of having a solution vector with real number en-
tries instead of the default 0 and 1, the same researchers proposed to use a number of qubits
(K)to construct a fixed-point representation such that each entry in the solution vector is:
ai=−qi
K+K−1X
k=1qi
k
2K−k(3.4)
where the possible values of each vector entry are spaced within [−1,1)with Kas:

meaning that for K= 1there are only two possible values -1 or 0, for K= 2there are four
values, and so on.
This approach extends the usability of DW’s hardware to work with real numbers with a
set precision tunable by the user, at the cost of using extra Kqubits. This implies that a
problem represented by an N×Nmatrix requires a number of logic qubits equal to NK.
In the next section we will see the details of how to use the QAE algorithm but, in short, the
user has to submit the matrix representing the problem, then choose the number of qubits K
to set the precision, and then in each run one has to tune the value of λto find the ground
state of the system and, in case of a chain break, tune the chain strength.
It is important to notice that the precision of the calculation cannot be improved by simply
increasing K, because its value is limited by the total available logical qubits and, most
practically, by the fact that the more qubits are used the more chains are needed to represent
the problem on the hardware and this effectively increases the chances of chain break making
it difficult or impossible to perform a calculation.
This limitation can be extended by reducing the size of the matrix by performing a block
diagonalization and by using an algorithm that improves the precision without increasing the
number of qubits klike the one we proposed in [62] the adaptive QAE (AQAE), both tools
are discussed in details in the next section.
Despite these challenges, over the last few years many studies from various fields have
been conducted using the DW hardware without the need of using extra tools. The most
common application is for optimization problems [154–158], while other applications can
be seen in life sciences [159–162] and in finance for portfolio optimization in stock market
[163–166]. At the publishing of this paper there are more than 250 results listed on an updated
list of featured applications of DW hardware [167].
Regarding the field of particle physics, the first use of DW was done to solve a Higgs-signal-
versus-background optimization problem in [168], followed by a study of vertex reconstruction
of hadronic interaction in [169] without using any extra tools. We contribute to the literature
with the first use of DW for studying lattice gauge theory with the study of SU(2) energy
spectrum and time evolution in [62], which was followed by a study of SU(3) time evolution
and dynamics of neutrino entanglement in [88], a study of the hadronic spectrum of 1+1
quantum chromodynamics in [89], and the study of LGT on dihedral group in [83]. All
of these studies used the QAE algorithm, instead a recent paper [78] studied a U(N) LGT
on 2-dimensional lattice imposing geometric constrains to extract the system equilibrium
configurations effectively performing an importance sampling.

Here we consider the theory with an even number of plaquettes 2, 4 and 6 and periodic
boundary conditions (p.b.c) along the longitudinal direction. The five separate physical
37

--- PAGE 53 ---
systems considered are 2 plaquettes with jmax= 1/2,1and3/2and, 4 and 6 plaquettes with
jmax= 1/2.
The Hamiltonian representation for these systems can be obtained by using the method
illustrated in Appendix C, here for a question of space only the Hamiltonian for the case of 2
plaquettes with jmax= 1/2is shown:

where the states on the right of the Hamiltonian are shown in Fig. 3.1:

boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction after the jmax= 1/2truncation. Each solid
line means a j= 1/2flux of energy is present, a dashed line a j= 0meaning no energy is
present, while the dotted line on the right indicates the lattice side that is periodic.
As we discussed in the previous Section 1.3, in the NISQ era rationalizing the use of
quantum resources by limiting the number of qubits is crucial in order to reduce noise. In this
direction a possibility comes from block diagonalization of Hamiltonian using the symmetries
of the system, so that it can be divided into smaller blocks and each one of them can be
studied separately in the quantum hardware, reducing the number of qubits needed and
effectively improving the performances of the hardware.
To make it tangible, let’s focus on the 2 plaquette Hamiltonian, where we can observe
that the two states |22
221
1⟩and|21
122
2⟩can be interchanged leaving the Hamiltonian invariant,
therefore we may substitute these states with linear combinations1√

consequently has the effect of substituting their corresponding rows and columns with new
ones obtained by adding and subtracting the original one.
Performing this operation on the 2-plaquette Hamiltonian divides it into two separate blocks

This approach can be generalized and applied to any Hamiltonian matrix of any dimension
by exploiting the symmetries present on the basis states like top-to-bottom reflection, left-
to-right reflection and, spatial translation in the longitudinal direction. Therefore once all
the physics states allowed for a particular system are found, those two or multiple states
38

--- PAGE 54 ---
that are symmetric under one of the possible symmetries, are replaced by symmetric and
antisymmetric combinations.
The result of block diagonalizing for the five physical systems considered, 2 plaquettes with
jmax= 1/2,1and3/2and 4 and 6 plaquettes with jmax= 1/2, is summarized in Table 3.1,
where for each physics system it is shown the block decomposition and the groundstate block

system is labelled by the lattice size expressed in plaquettes number, Nplaqand, the gauge
truncation jmax. In the third column the full Hamiltonian block decomposition is displayed
and in the last column the groundstate block size.
Now that we have decomposed the Hamiltonian representation in blocks for each system
we are interested in, we can discuss in detail how to use the QAE algorithm on the DW
hardware.
As we already discussed, the QAE algorithm implements the variational method using the
following functional:
F≡ ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩ −λ⟨ψ|ψ⟩
where λhas to be tuned by the user to find the minimum eigenvalue and eigenvector.
To make the procedure more clear let’s show how to find the ground state for a fixed value of
the gauge coupling xfor the 2-plaquette lattice with jmax= 1, which it is contained in the
14×14block.
Given this block the matrix representation of the functional Fhas to be entered using
a python code working within the DW Ocean environment.
In all the results presented in this chapter the default annealing time of 20 microseconds was
used. It is possible to use a longer time but it increases the chances of depolarization of the
qubit causing the chain to break, while a shorter time may not be enough to allow the system
to transit to the final system.
The procedure is used to extract the ground state and is made by two consecutive steps:
The first step consists of running the code many times on the DW quantum simulator
to scan the value of λto find the optimal value for which DW returns the minimum possible
energy. Those runs are done at a fixed value of Kqubits used to represent each real entry in
the matrix. Those runs are repeated a few times by increasing Konly to check that there is
no significantly smaller value for the energy of the system. The results of this first step are
shown in Figure 3.2 for the case of 2-plaquettes with jmax= 1andx= 0.9:

In Figure 3.2 it is evident that for K≤5is not enough to approach the exact results. For
K= 6the result is close to the exact eigenvalue, while for K= 8and7a broad range of λ
values reproduce the exact eigenvalue. From this plot the range of optimum lambda ( λopt)
values that correspond to the minimum energy of the system is extracted.
The second step is performed by running the same code using a DW quantum hardware,
which requires to set the chain strength. A value close to λoptis used for λand the best
value from the first step is used for K. The second step is repeated few times by reducing
the chain strength value until no lowering of the system energy is observed and no chain
breaks happened. If the precision obtained on the DW hardware is not satisfactory, one can
increase Kand repeat the second step as shown in Figure 3.3 where the best estimation of
the groundstate energy is −1.78019.

algorithm on DW hardware Advantage are shown, while exact eigenvalue is indicated by the

There is one main observation, in our study we always used the DW simulator to find K
andλoptbecause we needed to maximize our one minute hardware time per month. However,
in the case one has enough hardware time the calculations can be all performed on a quantum
hardware, by executing the first step for a initially set value of the chain strength, once the
best value for Kandλoptare found the chain strength can be reduced to find a possible lower
energy solution.
To extract precise results for a matrix block larger or equal to a 14×14the QAE requires a
large number of qubits Kto represent the real number limiting the precision achievable and
the matrix size that can be studied on the DW hardware. With the goal of extending the
QAE usability we developed an adaptive QAE (AQAE) algorithm in [62] which improves the
precision without increasing the number of qubits used. The AQAE runs the QAE several
times with the same value for Kand at the end of each run gives a user the possibility to find
a better solution by re-running the code reusing the best eigenvector found in the previous
run as a starting point for the new solution search. The new search is centred around the
previous minimum with the entries in the new solution vector now taking one of the 2Kvalues
around the previous entry value, therefore the precision in resolving the minimum is doubled
and each step, effectively performing a zoom in around the minimum. Extra details and the
41

--- PAGE 57 ---
code implementation can be found in the appendix of our published articles [62].
The AQAE not only rationalizes the use of qubits and reduces the the possibility of chain
breaks but creates the possibility of using DW for much larger matrices without reducing the
qubits deployed for precision.
The effectiveness of the AQAE can be seen in Figure 3.4 where the groundstate of 2-plaquettes
with jmax= 1contained in a 14×14block is extracted using only K= 4precision qubits.

algorithm on the DW hardware Advantage from 104reads for different precision iteration
(K+Z)starting from K= 4andZ= 0then increasing Zby 1 in each subsequent step. The
black points joined by a dotted line are data obtained using AQAE on DW Advantage with
K= 4,Z= 3and104reads after having truncated the matrix from 14×14to10×10.
The plot clearly shows a good agreement with the exact result for x≤0.4already using
K= 4with 4 zoom step (k+Z= 8). While for x≥0.4the data k+Z≥8are slightly
above the exact curve but they are in good agreement with the data coming from the 10×10
truncation of the (14×14)block, therefore some systematic hardware error should be present.
The result can be improved if needed by choosing a Kvalue larger than 4 and rerunning the
AQAE algorithm.
In the next sections the QAE and the AQAE with the procedure just described are used to
systematically extract the smallest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of each block
present in the block decomposition for each of the five physical systems.
3.2.1 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors using QAE and AQAE algorithm
We begin this study by considering the simplest possible system made of two plaquettes
with jmax= 1/2whose Hamiltonian in Eq. 3.8 which is made by a 3×3block and a 1×1
block, with the result shown in Figure 3.5.

The results in Figure 3.5 shows the four eigenvalues of the 2-plaquette lattice with
jmax= 1/2as a function of the gauge coupling x. The data points displayed only for the
ground state are coming from the QAE DW hardware Advantage using 103reads, annealing
time of 20 microseconds, and K= 7qubits for precision for a total of 21 logical qubits. The
results are in good agreement with the exact results displayed as a solid line and no visible
discrepancy is observed with x. There are no data points for the other three eigenvalues
because the QAE algorithm was set to extract only the smallest eigenvalue and eigenvector of
each block.
It is valuable to investigate how the theory changes when longer lattice and larger gauge field
truncation jmaxare considered, therefore extra simulations where done and the results for
the eigenvalues obtained using the default annealing time of 20 microseconds are shown in
Figures 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.
The first extension of this study is shown in Figure 3.6 where the 4 lowest eigenvalues
of the 2-plaquette lattice with jmax= 1as a function of the gauge coupling xare displayed.

was not able to find a reasonably precise result using 104reads, therefore the AQAE with 104

value of x. The results are in good agreement except for the 14×14block, where the data

coming from the 14×14block, since 36×36block contains the 14×14block, the data of
this later block are displayed instead.

Considering the quantum resources available, the study can be further extended by fixing
jmax= 1/2to quantify how the theory changes on a longer lattice, the results of this extension
are showed in Figures 3.8 and 3.9.
The first lattice extension is shown in Figure 3.8 for the 4-plaquette lattice case. For
the two 3×3blocks 103and reads while for the 6×6block 104reads were necessary while
using the QAE. The number of precision qubits was K= 7for a total of 21 logical qubits for

Over all the DW quantum hardware Advantage has shown good performances by producing
accurate data points by implementing the QAE and, for precise result the AQAE which
reduces the number of qubits needed and reduces the chances of chain breaks, allowing to
obtain plots where statistical error bars are smaller than the data symbols. The AQAE
effectiveness in reducing the statistical errors can be appreciated in an example of calculation
shown in Figure 3.10, where three different runs are obtained for the 6-plaquette with
jmax= 1/2atx= 0.2as a function of the zoom steps in the AQAE with 104reads and K= 4.
The black points joined by dotted lines are three separate datasets obtained on the DW
Advantage hardware showing a rapid convergence between them and toward the exact result,
represented by a black dashed curve, already after 4 zoom steps. The remaining discrepancy

3.2.2 Investigating how the theory changes with a larger jmaxtrun-
cation and lattice size.
It is interesting to show how precise the simulations done on DW are, to the point that
they can be used to characterize how the theory changes when considering a higher value for
the gauge truncation jmaxor a larger lattice size. This can be done by using any state, but it
is particularly meaningful to use the state with the lowest possible energy, that traditionally
is used to extract the vacuum expectation value of observables that describe important
properties of the system like spontaneous breaking of the system’s symmetries, one of the
most iconic examples is the Higgs field that has a non zero vacuum expectation value breaking
the electroweak symmetry which gives masses to the particles.
This can be done easily on DW without doing new simulations, because the result of each
simulation is an energy and the corresponding eigenstate. Therefore, to calculate the vacuum
expectation value it is enough to consider the corresponding vectors to the ground state
energies used to create the previous plots.
In our case the only operator considered is the Hamiltonian, therefore we consider its vac-
uum expectation value and the one of the chromoelectric and the chromomagnetic operator:
⟨0|HSU(2)|0⟩,⟨0|HE|0⟩and⟨0|H□|0⟩. The calculation can simply be done by recalling that
48

--- PAGE 64 ---
the matrix representation of HEis given by the diagonal element in the Hamiltonian while
the values of H□are given by the off-diagonal elements.
How the vacuum expectation value of those three operators changes with the gauge trunca-
tionjmaxis shown in Figure 3.11 while their change with the lattice size is shown in Figure 3.12.

The data points in Figure 3.11 show a particularly good agreement with the exact classical
calculation for the case jmax= 1/2for the three operators, while for the case jmax= 1a visible
deviation from the exact curve growing with the value of the gauge coupling xis present for
the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic term, but not for the full Hamiltonian. Finally, even
if the data points for jmax= 3/2are not displayed due to the fact that DW did not resolve
them from the one of jmax= 1, it is valuable to notice that <0|H|0>for exact calculation of
jmax= 3/2represented by a dotted curve is particularly close to the one of jmax= 1, dashed
line, and the DW data for <0|H|0>, the black triangles are in agreement with both curves.
This clearly shows that in the gauge coupling range 0< x < 1, the truncated theory has a
rapid convergence toward the full untruncated theory already at small value of jmax.
To better visualize how the vacuum expectation value depends on the lattice size, it is
convenient to consider an energy density obtained by normalizing the energy by the number
of plaquettes as shown in Figure 3.12.

normalized vacuum expectation values are local quantities independent of the lattice size.
By globally observing both plots in Figure 3.12 and Figure 3.11 one can notice that the
chromoelectric and chromomagnetic terms have larger error and discrepancy compared to the
total energy.
This can be explained by simply recalling that in the variational method the eigenvalues are
extracted with higher precision compared to the eigenvector. In a more quantitative way,
given a perturbation ϵ, the eigenvalues are corrected to an order O(ϵ)while the eigenvalues to
an order O(ϵ2)[170].
In conclusion in the range of gauge coupling considered 0< x < 1, the theory on a 2
plaquette lattice shows rapid convergence toward the full untruncated theory already at
jmax= 1, while for the case jmax= 1/2the theory is local, showing no visible dependence on
the lattice size.

3.3 SU(2) time evolution on D-Wave
The real-time evolution of the model can be directly accessed in the Hamiltonian approach
using the time evolution operator e−iHt, but for DW there is no simple way to encode it
on the hardware. One interesting solution is to rethink the time evolution problem as a
ground-state eigenvalue problem using the so called Kitaev-Feynman clock states [171–174]. In
a nutshell, this consists of using an operator with a ground state that contains the entire time
evolution sequence from the initial to the final state, allowing one to calculate in parallel the
entiretimeevolution ofthesystem. Toillustratethisapproachwefollowthediscussionin[172].
Let’s suppose that we would like to solve the Schrödinger equation
i∂t|Ψ(t)⟩=H(t)|Ψ(t)⟩ (3.9)
with the goal of finding the state of the system at a later time tf. The solution will have the
general form |Ψ(tf)⟩=U(tf, t0)|Ψ(t0)⟩where U(tf, t0)is the time evolution operator from
the initial time to the final time.
We can now divide the time evolution process into Nsteps of size ϵ, such that:
|Ψ(tf)⟩=U(tf, t0)|Ψ(t0)⟩=U(tf, tf−1). . . U(t2, t1)U(t1, t0)|Ψ(t0)⟩(3.10)
and let’s keep track of each time evolution step with a clock state set {|t⟩}such that:
|0⟩ |1⟩ . . . |t+ϵ⟩ . . . |tf−1⟩
|Ψ(t0)⟩ U(t1, t0)|Ψ(t0)⟩. . .U(t+ϵ, t−ϵ)|Ψ(t−ϵ)⟩. . . U(tf, tn−1)|Ψ(tn−1)⟩
when the clock is |0⟩the system is in the state |Ψ(t0)⟩and at a later clock time |tf−1⟩the
system is in the state |Ψ(tf)⟩.
It is useful to create a connection between the clock states set {|t⟩}and the corresponding
states of the physical system |Ψ(t)⟩by entangling each corresponding pairs and then sum all
pair creating the following state:
|Θ⟩=1√
N
|Ψ(t0)⟩ ⊗ |0⟩+. . .+|Ψ(tf−1)⟩ ⊗ |tf−1⟩
=1√
Ntf−1X
t=t0|Ψ(t)⟩ ⊗ |t⟩(3.11)
This state contains the entire time evolution from t0totf, hence the name history state.
The operator which maps the sequence of unitary time operators {Ui}to the the sequence of
clock states {|t⟩}and has the history state as a ground state is called the clock Hamiltonian
and was originally proposed by Feynman. One of its possible forms is:
Hc=C0+1
2tf−1X
t=0
I⊗ |t⟩⟨t| −Ut⊗ |t+ϵ⟩⟨t| −U†
t⊗ |t⟩⟨t+ϵ|+I⊗ |t+ϵ⟩⟨t+ϵ|
where Ut=e−iϵHtis the time evolution operator from time tto time t+ϵandC0is used to
specify the initial state at time t= 0.
51

--- PAGE 67 ---
Therefore the history state can be found by using the QAE algorithm using as a functional
the following:
L=X
t,t′⟨t′|⟨Ψt′|Hc|Ψt⟩|t⟩ −λ X
t,t′⟨t′|⟨Ψt′|Ψt⟩|t⟩ −1!
(3.12)
where |Ψt⟩is the state of the system at time t,|t⟩is the state of the clock at time tand the
Lagrange’s multiplier is needed for the solution to have a unit norm. This functional was
obtained using a discrete-time variational principle that authors of [172] called time-embedded
discrete variational principle (TEDVP).
The computational cost of using the clock Hamiltonian in terms of logical qubits is given by
the product of the dimension of the time evolution operator, the number of time steps chosen
and number of precision qubits K.
This method can be used for example to study the real-time evolution between the two excited
states 1and2, and show how to extract from the time evolution their energy gap.
To perform this study one has to first deal with the fact that DW hardware does not handle
complex numbers, which are inevitably present in the time evolution operator Ut=e−iϵHt.
One possible solution to this is to use a basis that makes the Hamiltonian imaginary so that
the time evolution operator is a real matrix.
For the case of two-plaquette lattice Hamiltonian in Eq. 3.7 there is no change of basis that
converts the Hamiltonian into a purely imaginary matrix, therefore to find a new basis in
which H3x3is a imaginary matrix a possible solution is the introduction of a fictitious heavy
state:

where the red column and row are due to the introduced heavy state and are needed for
finding a purely imaginary representation of the Hamiltonian.
The effect of this heavy state on the energy spectrum is shown in Figure 3.13, where it is
clear that its effect is negligible in the range of gauge coupling 0< x < 0.2. Therefore in this
range Hnewcan be used to study the time evolution of the original Hamiltonian.

the two physical excited states while the right bottom block in red contains the ground state
and the added heavy state. The constant part of the Hamiltonian can be dropped because we
are only interested in extracting the energy difference of the two states. The time evolution
operator of the blue block needed for the clock Hamiltonian is obtained by direct calculation
ofe−iHbluetand it is represented by a real matrix:

qubits for precision for a total of 28 logical qubits. Although the number of logic qubits is
not large compared to other simulations in the previous section, the time interval cannot be
extended to a longer time because the DW hardware works best only with stoquastic matrices,
which have only off-diagonal nonpositive elements. The clock Hamiltonian is not stoquastic
for a generic time step ϵ, therefore the systematic error grows with the size ϵpresent in the
off-diagonal positive elements [175].
The real time evolution can be extended to a longer period of time by choosing ϵ=π/ωthat
makes all the off-diagonal element nonpositive whose result is shown in Figure 3.15, where a
clock Hamiltonian with 12 time step was used to obtain the time evolution of 12 steps in one

From both Figure 3.14 and Figure 3.15 the energy gap between the two states can be
extracted by measuring the oscillation period and calculating the frequency ω, obtaining
E2−E1= 2ω.
The same approach was previously used in [176] to observe six Rabi oscillations using
the DW hardware 2000Q a previous version of DW Advantage. In our result twelve time
steps have been reached showing significant improvement between two subsequent hardware
versions.
3.4 Conclusions and looking forward
In this chapter we have presented the main features of D-Wave quantum annealer (DW),
and the results obtained by using it to study the energy spectrum and the time evolution of a
SU(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT).
Our work was inspired by the first study of SU(2) LTG using a minimal lattice done on a
IBM gate-based quantum computer [84], which we tried to extend in many ways: we worked
on larger lattices made by 2,4, and 6 plaquettes; implemented a larger energy truncation
jmax= 1/2,1and3/2; and extended the time evolution to a larger time range, of about 10
times. With the result from DW we showed that in the range of gauge coupling 0< x < 1, the
energy spectrum swiftly converges already for a small energy truncation jmaxand in the case
55

--- PAGE 71 ---
of systems with the same jmax= 1/2and longer lattices, their spectrum rapidly convergence
after few plaquettes.
Although DW was designed to mainly solve Ising-type problems, these results were pos-
sible using the QAE algorithm developed in [149–153], which not only gave us the possibility
to study the energy spectrum and the time evolution of a LGT, but it also paved the way to
exploring other LGTs.
It should be noted that the accuracy of our results was obtained only by rationing the
number of qubits used, without using many of the available tools present on DW Ocean
software such as error-correction, chain break reduction, tuning of the annealer time and the
possibility of choosing the problem’s embedding. Using these extra tools might improve the
use of the quantum resources but would not change the scaling of resources with lattice size.
Rationing the use of quantum resources is important, because even if DW had a large number
of physical qubits, the logical qubits are limited, so we rationed the use of logical qubits by
the system symmetries to block diagonalizing the Hamiltonian representation of each case,
resulting in hardware manageable matrix sizes and, leaving only for a few problematic cases
the need to further truncate the matrix.
For additional rationing, a crucial choice was the introduction of the adaptive QAE al-
gorithm, which allowed us to work with large matrix blocks without increasing the number of
qubits used to make the calculation precise.
The time evolution of the theory was possible by an intelligent use of the Kitaev-Feynman
clock state which converts the time evolution problem into a ground state, implementing for
our case the TEDVP developed in [172]. Despite the DW limitations associated with the use
of this method, we were able to study the transition between two excited states and extract
their energy splitting. Additionally, the study extended the time range in which the DW
hardware can operate compared to the results of a previous Rabi oscillations study using the
previous generation of DW hardware 2000Q [176].
It is important to emphasize that our work did not try to use quantum resources in such a
way that we could achieve polynomial scaling while working with the entire physical Hilbert
space of the theory, but we tried to achieve this by extracting physical information by block
diagonalizing the theory.
When asked the much more fundamental question of how polynomial scaling can be achieved
in study of LGT on DW hardware, we believe this goal can only be addressed by changing
the way users interact with qubits, giving them more freedom and flexibility to directly access
the qubits state.
Ultimately, the work presented in this chapter was the first to use the DW to study a
LGT, and represents an important proof of concept that has inspired other research groups
to further investigate the capabilities of DW’s hardware. In fact, the approach has been
used by the authors of Ref. [88] to study the energy spectrum of harmonic and anharmonic
oscillators, and the time evolution of a SU(3) LGT on a single plaquette, and neutrino flavor
56

--- PAGE 72 ---
dynamics in beam-beam collisions. For the latter two studies, an important extension has
been achieved while using the Kitaev-Feynman clock states by allowing complex values in the
QUBO elements by expressing the functional to be minimized in its real and imaginary part,
with the important result of making it easier to investigate the time evolution of a generic
theory.
A further application of DW has been done in [83] by studying the energy spectrum and time
evolution of a 2 plaquette LGT using dihedral groups instead of the more common SU(N).
Finally a recent study was done in [78] to find the configurations of a U(N) LGT paving the
way toward importance sampling of LGT on DW.
Looking to the future use of DW, new perspective will be available in the near future as part of
the company’s "Clarity" road map announced in 2021 at the annual D-Wave conference, where
it was unveiled that the company is focused on the development of a gate-based quantum
annealer, extending the functionality of the present hardware technology to use gates to
directly operate on qubits, similarly to what is already possible with other quantum computers.
This future gate-based quantum annealer will give users more flexibility in encoding their prob-
lem on the hardware and controlling the qubits, expanding the applicability of the hardware to
other fields of knowledge. For the studying of lattice gauge theories there will be the possibility
to use larger lattices for the systems already studied and, secondly the opportunity to consider
particle physics systems having more complex dynamics. In fact, having a gate-based quantum
annealer will certainly reduce the number of qubits needed to encode an operator, because
what now it is done by submitting the full matrix representation, it will likely be done by
encoding it using a few gates. Reducing the number of qubits needed for encoding a problem,
automatically shortens the length of the chain which has the effect of reducing the chances of
breaking the chain, making the hardware even more reliable. Ultimately, this advance could
lead to a polynomial scaling of the quantum resources needed to study a lattice gauge the-
ory with lattice size growth, achieving the definitive goal of outperforming a classical computer.
In conclusion, as discussed by DW researchers in [175], the current available DW annealer im-
plements a stoquastic traverse-field Hamiltonian making calculation free from the sign problem
only with problems represented by a stoquastic Hamiltonian. Therefore a future breakthrough
may come by extending the hardware to non-stoquastic systems with the introduction of
interactions of the form σx
iσx
jorσy
iσy
j. This will not only extend the usability of the hardware
to non-stoquastic Hamiltonians, but will also set the scene for the introduction of a universal
quantum annealer, which will be able to accommodate any Ising-like Hamiltonian without
restrictions. Such a hardware will be equivalent to an adiabatic quantum computer [177] for
which it was proved to be polynomially equivalent to a conventional quantum computer [141].

Chapter 4
SU(2) on IBM gate-based quantum
computers
In this chapter1we present the main features of IBM quantum computers and show how
they can be used to calculate the real-time evolution of the SU(2) pure gauge lattice theory
for the case of a 2 and 5 plaquettes lattice with jmax= 1/2using non-periodic boundary
conditions, and in particular the case of a travelling energy excitation across the lattice.
These results are in good agreement with the exact classical result thanks to the use of a
remarkable error mitigation technique that we introduced, called self-mitigation. Then we
present an extension of this approach for the case of 2-plaquette lattices with jmax= 3/2
whose simulations are under preparation. In conclusion, we provide an overview of the results
and discuss potential directions for future research.
4.1 The IBM quantum computer
Since 2016 the multinational technology company IBM has made their quantum computer
hardware available with the IBM Quantum Experience. While they started with few hardware
ranging from 1 to 5 qubits, at the time of writing 23 different computers ranging from 5 to
433 qubits are available. Of the 23, 9 computers with 5 to 7 qubits are available to the public
free of charges [178].
The IBM quantum computers are universal gate-based quantum computers, which means that
the qubit state can be directly manipulated by using operators called gates. Native gates, are
a specific set of gates that are implemented on the hardware and form a universal basis for
all possible operators. Therefore, any operator can be expressed as a combination of native
gates, making the hardware a universal quantum computer.
The software that allows the user to interact with the hardware provides a variety of default
gates outside the native get set, and the most common operators which are used in this
chapter are listed in Table 4.1.
1The results presented in this chapter were previously published in Phys. Rev. D 106, 074502 done in
collaboration with S. A Rahman, R. Lewis and S. Powell.

Table 4.1: List of the most common available gates which are used in this chapter, an extended
list of the default IBM gates present in the Qiskit library can be found here [179]. The first
eight gates listed are single qubit gates: Pauli X Pauli Y, Pauli Z, the rotation gates RX, RY
and RZ, the Hadamard Hand the Sgate, the last three act on a pair of qubits. The first
two are Controlled-x gates CX ijand they applies a Pauli-X gate on the jqubit when the i
qubit is in the state |1⟩, and leave it unchanged when the iqubit is in the state |0⟩, while the
last one, the SWAP gate, as the name suggest swaps the states of two qubits.59

--- PAGE 75 ---
The state of the qubit is represented in the z-basis, often called the computational basis,
as|0⟩=1
0
and|1⟩=0
1
and any superposition of these two states, therefore the Pauli
gates X, Y, Zand rotation gates RX, RY, RZ have a well known action on the qubit state, as
can be confirmed by performing the matrix multiplication.
The Hadamard gate Hwhen acting on a qubit rotates it in the x-basis, therefore cre-
ating a superposition of the two qubit’s states, in fact H|0⟩=1√
2(|0⟩+|1⟩)=|+⟩and
H|1⟩=1√
2(|0⟩ − |1⟩) =|−⟩.
The phase gate Sis a phase shift gate of π/2and it is the square-root operator of the Pauli Z
gate,√
Z.
The controlled-x gate CX ct, often denoted as CNOT, is a 2-qubit gate, where the sub-
script clabels the control qubit and tlabels the target qubit. The target qubit state is flipped
by applying to it an Xgate when the control qubit state is in |1⟩and, and leaves the target
qubit unchanged when the control qubit is in |0⟩. The control not gates play an important
role in quantum computation because they are entangling gates. In fact, if the control qubit
is in a superposition, the control and the target qubit get entangled.
Finally, the SWAPis a 2-qubit gate that swaps the state of two qubits.
The measurement is done by default in the z-basis, and to measure in other bases it is
enough to project the qubit’s state before the measurement, in a such a way that the result
of the measurement of the z-basis returns the corresponding value in the chosen basis. For ex-
ample, tomeasureinthex-basisitisenoughtoenteraHadamardgatebeforethemeasurement.
It is important to consider that each hardware has only a specific set of native gates, the most
common ish
CX, I, RZ,√
X, Xi
, therefore any time a non-native gate is used an internal
algorithm called transpiler rewrites it in native gates.
In this respect under more general hypothesis about the set of native gates that it is assumed
to be able to generate a dense subset of SU(d), the Solovay-Kitaev theorem guarantees that
any unitary operator can be expressed as a combination of elements of a set of native gates
with accuracy ϵusing a finite sequence of gates, whose number is estimated by O(mlogc(m/ϵ))
where mis the number of CNOTgates and cis a constant [180, 181]. A recent review and
an algorithmical proof can be found here [182], and for a more detailed treatment and the
history behind see [70]. This fully justifies the fact that the IBM hardware is a universal
quantum computer.
The qubits are arranged on the hardware with a certain geometry and therefore their connec-
tivity varies depending of the hardware, from 1 to maximum 3 as can be seen in Figure 4.1.
This means a qubit can communicate directly with at most three other qubits, therefore a
qubit can be directly entangled, with a CXgate, only with the qubits to which it is connected.

Figure 4.1: Example of qubit layout and connectivity of some of the available IBM quantum
hardware. Each qubit is represented by a circle and the interqubit connection by a bar.
In these specific figures taken from the IBM quantum experience, the color on the qubits
indicated the readout error associated with the measurement of each qubit, while the color
of the bars the error associated to each CX. The error range is indicated in a scale from
black to light violet, with black for the lowest error rate and light violet for the highest error
rate, which are based on the hardware calibration at the time of the picture was taken. The
hardware layout were taken from [178].
The other hardware with a larger number of qubits 33,65,127,433, whose layout is too
large to be shown, have the same maximum connectivity equal to 3 and, the qubit layout is
obtained by repeating in space the 16 qubits layout present in Figure 4.1.
In case an operator requires connectivity larger that 3, one can use a SWAPgate, which is a
non-native gate made from the combination of three CXgates, making it one of the noisiest
gates.
The hardware is still noisy so the gates have a non-negligible error, the error rate changes on
each hardware hour by hour depending on the hardware calibration schedule. This information
is publicly accessible by choosing any hardware on the IBM quantum experience [178].
But in general the CXhas an error of order of 10−2, the error in measuring the qubit is of
order of 10−2, while the single qubit gates have an error of the order of 10−4.
A job can be executed on a chosen hardware by using the IBM Qiskit library written
in python. The operation is written in gates arranged to form a circuit, whose action on the
qubits is obtained by measuring the results of a certain number of experiments executed on
the hardware in terms of probabilities of obtaining a state in the z-basis.
An example of this process is shown in Figure 4.2 where the IBM hardware

From the 10000 experiments the measurements obtained are [|00⟩: 4666 ,|01⟩: 294,|10⟩:
517,|11⟩: 4523]we can see that the result is close to what was expected with close to half
the states in |00⟩and half in |11⟩, but there is a small probability for the states |01⟩and
|10⟩that should not be there. These are present due to what we generally call hardware errors.
In the next section we discuss some of the most common error mitigation techniques that we
have used to mitigate the hardware error present in our circuits.
Since 2016 there have been many particle physics studies that used the IBM quantum
simulator and/or hardware, therefore here we limit our references to an essential list of the
work related to the field of lattice gauge theory whose simulations were done on an actual
quantum hardware. This is inevitably naïve list because many works that used the actual
quantum hardware benefited from previous studies that focused in encoding the theory on
gate-base quantum hardware without using the actual hardware or that used only the quantum
simulator, but an interested reader can find more in the references inside the following listed
articles.

theory [86, 87, 89, 90].

4.2 Error mitigation techniques
The main error sources affecting the IBM hardware are: the qubit interaction with the
environment, known as qubit decoherence; the imperfect action of gates, known as gate error;
and errors made in reading the qubit state, measurement error.
In our case, the study of the time evolution of the theory requires a circuit with a simple
structure but it contains many gates, in particular many CNOT gates which are the noisiest,
resulting in noisy results, therefore to extract the signal a comprehensive set of error mitigation
techniques was used.
•Mitigation of measurement error:
To mitigate the error that the hardware makes when it reads the state of a qubit a
method called mitigation of measurement error [184] is commonly used and present
inside the IBM’s Qiskit library, but in our study we preferred to develop our own
implementation.
In general, for a circuit that uses nqubits, the measurement results can be found in
any of the 2northogonal states present in the computational basis.
To quantify the hardware error the method first creates each of these 2nstates with
a dedicated circuit on the hardware, then it uses the result of their measurement to
construct a 2n×2ncalibration matrix, whose entries are the probabilities that each
state once it is measured, has a superposition with another state.
In case the hardware is error-free, for example a quantum simulator, the calibration
matrix is diagonal, meaning that the states once measured have no superposition
with each other. The calibration matrix is then used to correct the readout error
present in the measurements of the physics circuit, by effectively rotating the results of
ameasurementaffectedbythehardwareerrortotheirbestpossibleerrorreducedversion.
To better visualize how this process works let’s consider the case of a 2-plaquette
lattice, where 2 qubits are needed. The 4 mitigation circuits needed are shown in
Figure 4.3.
Figure 4.3: The four circuits respectively representing the states |00⟩,|01⟩,|10⟩,|11⟩needed
by the mitigation of readout error when the circuit considered uses two qubits, as for the
2-plaquette case.
Once these four circuits are measured and their result it is used to create the 4×4cali-
bration matrix, this is applied through a linear fitting procedure called sequential least
squares programming to mitigate the readout error in the measurements of the physical
circuit, by extracting its most probable measurement if the readout error was not present.
63

--- PAGE 79 ---
The gate error is more complex to mitigate therefore two error mitigation techniques called
randomized compiling and self-mitigation are used and in case extra mitigation is required
these two techniques can be combined with zero-noise extrapolation.
•Randomized compiling also known as Pauli-twirling:
This is a technique developed in [185] to transform the CNOT coherent noise into
incoherent noise, by preventing the CNOT noise from forming a particular pattern.
This is done by creating new physics circuits in which each original CNOT gate is
equivalently substituted by a CNOT gate “surrounded” by Pauli and identity gates. It
can be shown that there are 16 possible ways to rewrite a CNOT gate as indicated in
Figure 4.4:

Figure 4.4: The 16 possible circuits equivalent to a single CNOT gate obtained by surrounding
a CNOT gate with combinations of Pauli and identity gates.
This means that to actively transform the CNOT noise from coherent to incoherent,
the physics circuit has to be run a sufficient number of times so that each CNOT gate
present in the original physics circuit can be randomly substituted with as many as
possible combinations of the 16 possible identities, this make this method particularly
computationally expensive. The final physics measurement is obtained by averaging the
measurements of these runs.
•Self-mitigation:
This method developed in [186] and inspired by a similar approach present in [104]
belongs to a class of error mitigation techniques in which an extra circuit is used to
estimate the hardware errors.
In these approaches, the error-estimation circuit should be as similar as possible to the
gatestructureofthephysicscircuitandshouldhaveaknownexactresult. Theestimation
of the hardware error from the error estimation circuit is obtained by measuring how far
the final state is from the known exact result. This knowledge is then used to mitigate
the hardware error affecting the physics circuit by using a proportional relation between
the error of the physics circuit and the error-estimation circuit.
For the case of time evolution, self-mitigation uses as error-estimation circuit identical
to the physics circuit as shown in Figure 4.5.
64

--- PAGE 80 ---
Figure 4.5: Schematic representation of the error-estimation circuit compared to physics
time evolution circuit used for self-mitigation. The physics time evolution circuit does N
steps forward in time starting from an initial state |i⟩ending to the final state |f⟩. The
error-estimation circuit starts from the same initial state |i⟩but it does N/2time steps
forward in time followed by N/2steps backward returning to the initial state.
The physics circuit does Ntime steps forward in time, while the error-estimation circuit
doesN/2time steps forward and N/2backward, returning to the initial state. Therefore,
the error-estimation circuit has the same gates in the same order and the identical or
opposite variable inside the rotation gates, and accordingly it closely reproduces the
physics circuit noise. The hardware error can be estimated in the disparity between the
final state of the error-estimation circuit and the chosen initial state.
Due to the variability of the hardware the two circuits have to run back-to-back
to ensure the hardware noise affecting them is similar. Therefore, the error mitigated
final result for the physics circuit is obtained through the self-mitigation equation:

•Zero-noise extrapolation:
The method developed by the authors of [187] studies the circuit noise by creating
copies of the original circuits where the noise is artificially increased by replacing each
CNOT gate by odd multiples (triplet, quintet etc.) as shown in Fig. 4.6.

the original circuit for the Zero-noise extrapolation technique. On the left the original circuit,
while on the right the same circuit in which the CNOT gates are replaced by a CNOT triplet.

The zero-noise limit of the original circuit is extracted by fitting the circuits’ measure-
ments with a function of the CNOT multiples, as the intercept of the curve with the
y-axis.
4.3 SU(2) time evolution on IBM quantum computers
The SU(2) pure gauge Hamiltonian considered in this chapter is the one presented in
Chapter 1:
ˆH=g2
2 X
i=linksˆE2
i−2xX
i=plaquettesˆ□i!
(4.2)
The operators present in the Hamiltonian cannot be simply substituted with a combination of
gates as can be done when considering an Ising model, therefore to encode the theory on the
hardware it is necessary to consider the matrix representation of the systems we are interested
in and to rewrite it using the available gates. This is the most general way to encode an op-
erator on the hardware and gives the user the flexibility to choose which gates they want to use.
To illustrate how this encoding can be done consider the case of a 2-plaquette lattice with
jmax= 1/2with closed boundary conditions, whose Hamiltonian can be rewritten with the
available gates from its matrix representation as:
2
g2H=
0−2x−2x0
−2x3 0 −x
−2x0 3 −x
0−x−x9
2
=3

−x
2(3X0⊗I1+X0⊗Z1)−x
2(3I0⊗X1+Z0⊗X1)
(4.3)
where the subscript at each gate denotes the qubit the gate acts on. It is fairly common in
quantum information theory and in quantum computing literature to omit the Kronecker
product symbols ⊗and the identity gate Ifor question of space.
This decomposition in gates is obtained by considering only the matrix representation of the
possible combinations of the identity and Pauli gates. For small matrices this can be done
using pen and paper but a general way is presented in Appendix D where a gate decomposing
algorithm that uses only the identity and Pauli gates is described in detail.
The 4 states used to represent the Hamiltonian:
66

--- PAGE 82 ---
Figure 4.7: The four possible states available on the 2-plaquette lattice with jmax= 1/2. Each
solid line indicates a j= 1/2flux of energy is present, while the dashed line j= 0indicates
no energy is present. If all the links of a plaquette have j= 1/2we label the plaquette as
switched “on”, otherwise the plaquette is switched “off”.
These can be coded on the hardware using 2 qubits, one for each plaquette:
1)−→ | 0⟩|0⟩, 2)−→ | 0⟩|1⟩, 3)−→ | 1⟩|0⟩, 4)−→ | 1⟩|1⟩ (4.4)
This is a very natural encoding that clearly represents the physics of the jmax= 1/2gauge
truncation with non periodic boundary conditions (NPBC) not only for the two plaquette
lattice but for any lattice size. The motivation resides in the fact that with NPBC and for
jmax= 1/2to respect Gauss’ law the links in a plaquette have stringent restriction to their
value. In fact, the top and bottom link of a plaquette are always equal with j= 0or1/2,
while each vertical link shared by two plaquettes have a value of j= 0if the jflux flowing in
the two plaquettes is the same and j= 1/2otherwise.
Apart from this particular case, the labelling of the state using qubits is chosen in a completely
arbitrary way and does not need to contain any physics meaning. In fact any encoding is
acceptable as far as it matches the basis ordering used to represent the Hamiltonian.
To access the time evolution of the theory one has to find a way to encode on the hardware
the time evolution operator, that with the Hamiltonian rewritten in gates assumes the form:
e−iHt=e−i(3
8(7−3Z0−Z0Z1−3Z1)−x
2(3+Z1)X0−x
2(3+Z0)X1)t(4.5)
where for convenience time is in unit of 2/g2.
Nevertheless, even in this new form there is no simple way to directly encode the expo-
nential of gates on the hardware. Hence one possible way is to approximate it by discretizing
the time into small time steps dtand use a Suzuki-Trotter expansion [188], keeping in mind
that higher orders are more precise with an error scaling with higher power of dtbut have the
downsideofrequiringtoomanygates, thereforeacompromisehastobefoundbetweentheerror
introduced by the time discretization and the gate error introduced by a large number of gates.
For the case of 2 plaquettes it was particularly convenient to use a second order Suzuki-Trotter
expansion compared to a first order because after carefully reordering the gate terms, both
orders require the same number of CNOT gates, but the second order is more precise and
allows one to use a much larger time step dt. This means that we can access a wider time
range with a circuit having the same number of CNOT gates; while an order larger than 2
has too many gates making the circuit too noisy for currently available hardware.
67

--- PAGE 83 ---
The expression for the second order expansion for Nttime steps with time-step size dtreads:
e−iHt=e−iPm
j=1Hjt= mY
j=1e−iHjdt/21Y
j=me−iHjdt/2!Nt
+O 

(4.6)
that in our case leads to:
e−iHt=ei(xt/4)Z1Y0ei(3t/16)Z0Z1ei(3xt/4)Y0ei(9t/16)Z1ei(9t/16)Z0ei(3xt/4)Y1ei(xt/4)Z0Y1

where the Hamiltonian’s constant term21
8was dropped because it will cancel out when
calculating the probabilities of the time evolution. The expression can be expressed using
single-qubit rotations and CNOT gates with the help of few a identities derived in Appendix E:
e−iθZj=RZj(2θ), (4.8)
e−iθYj=RYj(2θ), (4.9)
e−iθZjZk=CX jkRZk(2θ)CX jk, (4.10)
e−iθZjYk=CX jkRYk(2θ)CX jk, (4.11)
where the CNOT gate for controlling qubit jand target kis labelled as CX jkand the
rotation gate acting on the qubit jalong the xandyaxis as RX jandRYjrespectively. These
identities lead to the following gates expression for the single step time evolution operator:

Figure 4.8: Circuit encoding a single second-order Suzuki-Trotter step for the case of 2
plaquette lattice with jmax= 1/2and non periodic boundary conditions. The top horizontal
line represents the qubit 0 while the bottom one the qubit 1, and the gates are applied on the
qubits from left to right. The circuit can be used for a forward time step with t=dtand for
a backward step with t=−dt. The circuit has 6 CNOT gates and 11 rotation gates, that are
reduced to 4 CNOTs after cancellations with neighbouring steps are considered.
68

--- PAGE 84 ---
Nevertheless the circuit has a reasonably small number of gates, but with the goal of
rationalizing the quantum resources the circuit can be optimized by reducing the number of
CNOT gates by considering cancellations among the edge CNOT gates from neighbouring
Suzuki-Trotter steps leading to only 4 CNOTs per Trotter-Suzuki step, with the only exception
for the first and last CNOT of the full circuit. This has the consequence of exposing the
rotation gates RY(−1
2xt)that can now be combined into a single rotation with doubled angle
RY(−xt). These optimization operations are done inside the code written to submit the
circuit to the hardware.
The circuit with these extra optimizations can now be used to find the time evolution
of the theory given an initial state by simply submitting to the hardware as many copies
as needed of the circuit to reach the time range of interest and finally, obtaining the time
evolution probabilities by measuring the final qubits state. An clear example is shown in the
lower panel of Figure 4.8 where each point was obtained by using the quantum hardware
ibm_lagos with a circuit containing two Trotter-Suzuki steps.

and randomized compiling. In the lower panel the triangles are the final results of our error
mitigation method that processes the upper panel data through the self-mitigation equation
Eq. 4.1. Figure reproduced from Ref. [63].
It is important to notice that the probability that one plaquette has a flux of j= 1/2, is
the sum of two contributions, one when only that plaquette has a flux of j= 1/2and the
other when both plaquettes have a flux of j= 1/2. Therefore the probabilities displayed for
the left and the right plaquette have a sum larger than 1. The data points at each time in
Figure 4.8 were obtained by submitting a two steps Trotter-Suzuki circuit using the 7 qubits
quantum hardware ibm_lagos which allows on each job to run a sequence of 300 circuits
back to back each with 104hits. The measurement protocol used is as follows:
Of those 300 circuits, 4 circuits are used for the mitigation of measurement error; 148
circuits for randomized compiling of the error-estimation circuit and 148 for randomized
compiling of the physics circuit.
Once the measurements of those 300 circuits are collected, the calibration matrix is applied
to the measurements of the error-estimation circuits and the measurements of the physics
70

--- PAGE 86 ---
circuits for mitigating the hardware measurement error.
The measurement of the physics circuits and the ones of the error-estimation circuits are com-
bined inside the self-mitigation equation to mitigate the gate error present in the measurement
of the physics circuits, by considering that the exact known result for the error-estimation
circuit for the case considered has probability 1 for the left plaquette and 0 for the right
plaquette.
Finally, the error bars for the error-estimation and the physics results are calculated as the
sum in quadrature of the statistical error from the 104hits and the error from bootstrapping
the data using 1480 samples.
The effectiveness of self-mitigation can be appreciated by comparing the data in the upper
panel where only mitigation of measurement error and randomized compiling is present with
the self-mitigated data in the lower panel. In fact, in the upper panel for time larger than 1
the triangles are far away from the curves representing the exact classical results, and for time
larger than 4 the signal looks completely lost into pure noise. By applying self-mitigation,
the signal is extracted and it is overall consistent with the exact results even for points
coming from circuits with up to 400 CNOT gates. The agreement of the data with the exact
result could have been further improved by using zero-noise extrapolation on top of the error
mitigation used.
In conclusion, this approach can be used to find the time evolution operator given the
theory Hamiltonian. Firstly, by decomposing the Hamiltonian in gates and secondly by
approximating the time evolution operator by means of only CNOT and single qubit gates,
leading to the final optimized time evolution circuit. This circuit can then be executed on a
quantum hardware to calculate the time evolution using a few error mitigation techniques.
In the next sections we will see how this approach to study time evolution is used to
observe a traveling excitation across the 2-plaquette lattice and the time evolution for the
case of 5-plaquettes.
4.4 Traveling excitation on a two-plaquette lattice
The robustness of the measurement protocol that uses three error mitigation techniques
makes it possible to extract small variations among the probabilities giving the possibility
to observe a travelling excitation across the 2-plaquette lattice from calculations done on a
quantum hardware.
The code and the measurement protocol used to create Figure 4.9 is identical to the one of
Figure 4.10. The only difference is in the physics parameters. The gauge coupling is now
x= 0.8necessary so that for the theory to show traveling oscillations and the time step size
dt= 0.12.
71

--- PAGE 87 ---
Figure 4.10: Traveling excitation observed from the time evolution for the case of 2-plaquette
lattice at gauge coupling x= 0.8and time step dt= 0.12using as an initial state a j= 1/2
flux of energy only in the left plaquette. The red solid (blue dashed) curve in both panels
is the exact probability of the left (right) plaquette having an energy flux of j= 1/2over
time. The red left-pointing (blue right-pointing) triangles are the physics data from runs
on the quantum hardware ibm_lagos . All the data are error mitigated using mitigation of
measurement error, randomized compiling and self-mitigation. Figure adapted from Ref. [63].
It is important to notice that the probability that one plaquette has a flux of j= 1/2, is
the sum of two contributions, one when only that plaquette has a flux of j= 1/2and the
other when both plaquettes have a flux of j= 1/2. Therefore the probabilities displayed for
the left and the right plaquette have a sum larger than 1.
The agreement of the mitigated data with the exact classical result is remarkable up to
t= 4where up to 100 CNOT gates are present. For larger time, when the number of CNOTs
get much larger the discrepancy is particularly pronounced for the right plaquette. The extra
systematic error present in the right part of the plot at large time can be in principle improved
by using zero-noise extrapolation, but the large quantity of CNOT gates already present in
the time evolution circuits make it not possible to adds extra CNOTs on the current hardware.
Overall, the physics phenomenon is well distinguishable, the system is initially prepared
with the left plaquette switched on (red triangles) and the right one switched off. With
time the left plaquette probability drops, equating the right plaquette probability around the
time range 4−5and after that it further drops close to zero, while the probability of the
right plaquette rises close to 1. A similar study for a compact U(1)lattice gauge theory was
previously done in [136], where the propagation and collision of travelling excitation real-time
were observed with calculations coming from a quantum simulator.
72

--- PAGE 88 ---
In conclusion, this calculation clearly shows that the available IBM quantum hardware can
be used to investigate interesting non-perturbative phenomena on a small lattice, and clearly
indicates the future possibility of quantum hardware with larger numbers of qubits to investi-
gate the same phenomena on larger lattices which a classical computer is not able to do, due
to the exponentially large number of resources necessary.
4.5 Five-plaquette lattice with jmax= 1/2
In the standard study of lattice gauge theory using simulations a crucial role is played by
the lattice size, in fact the larger the lattice size the smaller the physics scale at which the
physics is resolved, opening the possibility to measure quantities that can be extrapolated
to the continuum limit and be relevant for comparison with experiments. Therefore, it is
significant to explore the possibility to use a longer lattice and investigate the feasibility of
the current quantum hardware.
Inspired by the possibility of doing future studies on significant, large lattices, the Hamiltonian
for a two-plaquette lattice with jmax= 1/2presented in Equation 4.3 can be generalized to
the case of N-plaquette with jmax= 1/2as:
H=g2
2(hE+hB), (4.13)
hE=3
8(3N+ 1)−9
8(Z0+ZN−1)−3

2(3 +ZN−2)XN−1
−x
8N−2X
n=1(9 + 3 Zn−1+ 3Zn+1+Zn−1Zn+1)Xn, (4.15)
which requires Nqubits to encode the 2Nphysics states, clearly showing a polynomial scaling
with the number of plaquettes on a quantum computer, instead of the 2Non a classical
computer.
With the present NISQ hardware, we considered the 5-plaquette case because on the 7
qubits hardware ibm_lagos , the longest qubit chain with nearest-neighbour connectivity has
5 qubits. This let us avoid the use of swap gates that are noisy while using 1 qubit for each
plaquette, therefore the largest implementable lattice has 5 plaquettes.
The time evolution operator can be constructed following the same approach used for the case
of 2-plaquette lattice, by using the second order Trotter-Suzuki expansion in Equation 4.6 and
73

--- PAGE 89 ---
in addition to the identities presented in Equation 4.3 a new one that contains the exponential
of three gates:
e−iθZjYkZl=CX lkCX jkRYk(2θ)CX jkCX lk. (4.16)
The time evolution operator for a single second order Trotter-Suzuki step displayed in
Figure 4.11 has 28 CNOT gates that are further reduced to 22 after cancellations with
neighbour steps, with the only exception for the first and last CNOTs of the full circuit.
Consequently, three different pairs of rotation gates are combined into three rotation gates
with a doubled angle. These optimizations are done inside the 5-plaquette code written to
submit the circuit to the hardware, and whose structure is similar to the one used for the
2-plaquette case that can be found here [189].

Figure 4.11: Circuit encoding a single second-order Suzuki-Trotter step for the case of 5-
plaquette lattice with jmax= 1/2and non periodic boundary conditions. Each horizontal line
represents a qubit, from top to bottom from qubit 0 to qubit 4 and, the operators are applied
on the qubits from left to right. The circuit can be used for a forward time step with t=dt
and for a backward step with t=−dt. The circuit has 28 CNOT gates and 48 rotation gates,
that are reduced to 22 CNOTs after cancellations with neighbouring steps are considered.
The time evolution circuit can be submitted to the hardware to study how a chosen initial
state evolves in real-time as shown in Figure 4.12, where each point represents the time
evolution of four Trotter-Suzuki steps each for different step sizes dt, obtained by averaging
the result from 4 different jobs which showed variation within the statistical error.
Similarly, to the measuring protocol of the 2 plaquette case, each job submitted to the
hardware ibm_lagos by the 5-plaquette code, has a list with 300 circuits each executed 104
times. Of those 300 circuits, 32 circuits are used for the mitigation of measurement-error,
74

--- PAGE 90 ---
and the remaining 268 circuits are divided between the error estimation circuits necessary
for randomize compiling and self-mitigation, and the physics calculation. Hence, the total
statistics of each point is slightly larger than 5×105.
Figure 4.12: Time evolution for the case of a 5-plaquette lattice with jmax= 1/2at gauge
coupling x= 2.0, for only the centre plaquette with a flux of energy j= 1/2(switched on) as
initial state, obtained by 4 Trotter-Suzuki steps per point at different values of dt. The black
solid, blue dashed, and the red dotted curves are respectively the exact probability that the
flux of energy j= 1/2is in the centre plaquette, the two neighbours to the centre plaquette
and the two edge plaquettes. The solid black circle, blue triangle, and red square are the
corresponding data from the quantum hardware ibm_lagos after self-mitigation. The open
circle, triangle, and square are quantum data from ibm_lagos after using both self-mitigation
and zero-noise extrapolation. There are 94 CNOTs in each filled symbol while 282 in the
empty symbols. Figure adapted from Ref. [63].
The data labelled by the solid symbols were obtained by using three error mitigation
techniques, mitigation of measurement error, randomize compiling and self-mitigation. The
data labelled with the open symbols were obtained by using zero-noise extrapolation on top
of the three error mitigation techniques with CNOTs replaced by triplets and performing a
linear extrapolation.
Looking to the data displayed in Figure 4.12 we can notice that the quality of the agreement
between the data and the exact curve is not the same for all the probabilities considered.
The probability for the two neighbours to the centre plaquette, solid red squares, agrees with
75

--- PAGE 91 ---
the exact result. The probability for the center plaquette, solid black circles, is consistent
with the exact curve except for the time windows 0.4−0.8. Similar behaviour is seen for
the probability of the two edge plaquettes, solid blue triangles, with discrepancy in the time
range 0.1−0.3. For these two probabilities their discrepancy with the exact curve can be
significantly reduced by using the zero-noise extrapolation, as clearly shown by the open
symbols.
Motivated by this last improvement one could be tempted to consider a zero-noise extrapola-
tion using higher-orders like quintet of CNOTs or even more, but this would create for the
case of quintet a circuit with 470 CNOT gates, which will end up being too noisy making it
useless to mitigate the hardware errors.
Finally, it is important to remark that the result presented cannot be described as a travelling
oscillation because at gauge coupling x= 2.0the system is in a regime in which the chromo-
magnetic term dominates mixing the states used to represent the Hamiltonian. We could have
used the 5-plaquette lattice to observe a travelling oscillation at a small value of the gauge
coupling x, but the phenomena happens at a much larger time than the 2-plaquette case.
That would require a large number of Trotter-Suzuki steps, and the present noisy hardware
makes it unobservable.
4.6 Two-plaquette lattice with jmax>1/2
The first natural step to extend the previous works is to investigate the theory on 2-
plaquettes with a larger energy truncation ( jmax>1/2). Considering a larger truncation
is motivated by the fact that the theory present in chapter 2 has an infinite dimensional
Hilbert space, therefore using an angular momentum basis the full theory is reachable only
by considering larger and larger truncations. From the pure practical point of view, a larger
truncation allows more states and therefore the time evolution processes that can be studied
are much wider.
The encoding strategy used so far is to rewrite the Hamiltonian in gates and represent the
states by nqubits.
In this respect it is informative to consider how many states there are for each value of jmax, and
the corresponding number of qubits necessary for encoding the theory on a quantum hardware.
The number of states for each value of jmaxcan be obtained using the algorithm presented in
Appendix C, and the number of qubits is the first integer greater than log2(N states ). These
values are collected in Table 4.2:
jmax Nstates Min Nqubits
1/2 4 2
1 11 4
3/2 23 5
2 42 6
Table 4.2: Number of states and the minimum number of qubits necessary for each value of
jmaxfor the 2-plaquette case with non periodic boundary conditions.
76

--- PAGE 92 ---
There are no conceptual limitations to the value of jmaxto choose, but in practice for
a successful simulation of the system physics the jmaxvalue is constrained by the quantum
hardware number of qubits and its level of internal noise. Considering the performance of the
quantum hardware used so far, a wiser choice is to consider a Hamiltonian with a size of few
dozen and maximum 5−6qubits to represent the states.
In planning the simulation it is important to attempt an efficient use of the number of qubits
too. Since each qubit can represent 2 states, nqubits can represent up to 2nstates. It is
therefore reasonable to consider a truncation of the theory that has a number of states equal
to2n.
As we can see form the Table 4.2 only for the case jmax= 1/2the number of states coincides
with the maximum number of states representable with Nqubits. In all the other cases the
number of states is smaller than the number of possible states representable with Nqubits.
This means that there is a waste of resources and the presence of unphysical states in the
system.
The presence of extra unphysical states is not a problem, but during the measurement process
these states have to be recognized and manually eliminated. Furthermore, since these states
should not be present, their measurement should always result in a zero count on an error-free
hardware, therefore on the current NISQ hardware these states can be used as an error
estimator and possibly as a source on which to build error mitigation techniques.
A more elegant solution is to consider a truncation of the Hamiltonian that is not strictly
bounded to a particular value of jmaxand has a number of states exactly representable with
nqubits. To be more clear, if we are interested in a particular set of states present only to a
certain value of jmax, we can consider a larger truncation of the theory that contains these
particular states plus other high energy states and at the same time it is representable using
exactly nqubits. This choice is more than reasonable even if it contains extra states with
larger energies compared to the ones we are interested in. The reason is that the theory per
se (by itself) is not organized by the value of jmax, this distinction was introduced to better
describe and understand the theory.
Finally, in the process of measuring the states of the qubits we are free to consider only the
state transitions that are of our interest, exactly the same as we would do with a theory
described by a finite-dimensional representation.
4.6.1 Two-plaquette using a 16×16truncation of the jmax= 3/2case
The first step beyond the jmax>1/2case is to consider the case jmax= 1which has in
total of 11 states of which 4 states are from the case jmax= 1/2. Using 11 states makes the
encoding in qubits quite inefficient because 4 qubits can represent up to 16 states, therefore
a wise decision is to have 16 states by including the 5 lowest energy states from the case
jmax= 3/2. This means that we are considering a 16×16truncation of the jmax= 3/2case.
The 16 states used to represent the 16 ×16 truncation of the Hamiltonian are:

The large size of the Hamiltonian forced us to develop an analytical algorithm to express
any Hamiltonian of even size using only Pauli gates and the identity (X, Y, Z, I ). The decom-
position is unique for each particular representation of the Hamiltonian, but by permuting
the order of the states used to represent the Hamiltonian, different gate decompositions can
be found creating the possibility to choose the one with the smallest number of gate terms.
The method is described in Appendix D.
For this Hamiltonian with 16 states, there are (16!)permutations that cannot be accessed
with a reasonable amount of time. A possible heuristic solution is to randomly access some
of them and find one that is decomposable with a reasonably small number of gates. The
optimal Hamiltonian found so far requires 68 gate-terms and it should be one of the matrix
representations with the lowest number of gate-terms, since it requires less gate-terms than
the number of non-zero elements in the matrix.
Using the gate decomposition method introduced in Appendix D the optimal Hamiltonian

where the operation among the gates is not a standard matrix multiplication but the Kronecker
product, whose symbol ⊗was omitted for reasons of space. This is a fairly common notation
in quantum information theory and in quantum computing literature, (i.e. Y ZIY −→
Y⊗Z⊗I⊗Y).
The gate decomposition in Equation 4.20 is the gate decomposition of the optimal Hamiltonian
79

representation obtained by exchanging rows and columns in the original Hamiltonian in
Equation 4.17 as:
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16)7−→(6,2,8,4,9,1,6,10,13,11,12,16,14,5,3,15)
The gate decomposition in Equation 4.20 is the one used to calculate the time evolution
operator, and due to the large number of gates present only the first order Suzuki-Trotter
expansion [188]:

where Ntis the number of time steps and dtthe time-step size. The time evolution operator
circuit is made by the union of the circuits obtained by exponentiating each of the 68 gate
terms necessary to decompose the optimal Hamiltonian.
This was done with using the procedure described in E.
Since the CNOT gates are particularly noisy, these 68 circuits have been reorganized to
minimize the number of CNOT gates present by cancellation, leading to what we call the
optimal time evolution circuit. The following table summarizes the optimization of the final
circuits done by reorganizing the 68 circuits:

the 68 circuits, while in the right column the number of gates for the optimal circuit obtained
after reordering the terms.
The corresponding time evolution circuit of a single first order Suzuki-Trotter step is
organized in 14 distinct circuits:

where each circuit labelled with TandWcan be found in Appendix F, while the three SWAP
gates are necessary to deal with the qubit connectivity required by the circuit.
There are many interesting time evolution processes like multiple transitions among states,
traveling excitations on the lattice, but unfortunately many of them require a large time span
to be see for example Fig. 4.14:

solid curve is the exact probability of the left (right) plaquette being switched on, having an
energy flux of j≥0over time. The traveling excitation transition point is around t≈16
clearly out of reach with the current hardware, because using a reasonably small dtwill
require a large number of time steps, leading to a signal full of noise.
As we have shown in our previous work, [186] with the current NISQ hardware a time
evolution circuit with 100 CNOT can be used only for a few time steps before the noise cannot
be reasonably mitigated.
One possible reasonable challenge is to consider the system initially prepared with the
left plaquette switched “on” and time evolve it until it reaches a point of equilibrium between
the states for which j= 1/2,j= 1andj= 3/2, at which the probability of finding the initial
state in any group of states with higher jvalue is close to equal, as shown in Figure 4.15:

where the peculiar time evolution of equal balance between excited states is the point around
the time instant t= 0.185.
The goal of the upcoming simulations on the IBM quantum hardware is to clarify the
feasibility of this approach to study larger energy truncation and test the capabilities of the
self-mitigation technique to mitigate the hardware error when dealing with theories with
larger and more complex circuit implementation.
In the attempt to make clear the capabilities of the error mitigation techniques implemented
so far, the code prepared for these new simulations is an adaptation of the one used in [186]
for the case of 2-plaquette with jmax= 1/2and whose public source is present on [189].
4.7 Conclusions and looking forward
In this chapter we have presented the main features of the IBM gate-based quantum
computer and shown the results obtained by using it to study the time evolution of a SU(2)
pure gauge lattice theory, proving that the hardware can be successfully used in this scope.
In fact the real-time evolution study was extended to a time range much larger than any
previous study using non-Abelian lattice gauge theory [62, 84, 86, 88].
Being able to perform a long time evolution made it possible to report the first obser-
vation of a excitation moving across a small lattice in real-time from a calculation done
82

--- PAGE 98 ---
on quantum hardware, a dynamic phenomena that happens further away from the strong
coupling regime of the theory. This has an important conceptual value, because this simple
phenomenon cannot be observed using a classical computer once a much larger lattice is
considered due to the exponential scaling of the resources. Therefore, this calculation even
if done on a tiny lattice makes it clear that when the quantum hardware will have more
quantum resources, they will be able to study phenomena not accessible on classical computers.
Those results were possible thanks to the implementation of well-known error mitigation
techniques, readout error mitigation, randomized compiling and zero-noise extrapolation, but
an essential role was played by our error mitigation technique named self-mitigation developed
for this study. In developing this method, we were inspired by a similar idea used in [104]
in which the error estimation circuit is obtained from the physics circuit by removing all
single gates, leaving only the CNOT gates. This was motivated by the fact that the largest
contribution to the hardware error comes from the CNOT gate which is the noisiest. Instead,
to better estimate the hardware error globally affecting the physics circuit, self-mitigation
uses an error estimation circuit in which the physics circuits is used forward and backward in
time, having the same number of gates, in the same order and even the angles of the rotation
gates are the same or the opposite value. Therefore we think it better quantifies the hardware
error affecting the physics circuit. In fact, self-mitigation made it possible to extend the time
evolution study using close to 100 Suzuki-Trotter steps represented by circuits containing up
to 400 CNOT gates.
The method was successfully used by the authors of [90] in which they simulate Quan-
tum Chromodynamics in one spatial dimension with the goal of investigating the real-time
evolution of a hadron system evolving from common hadrons to tetraquarks and pentaquarks.
Furthermore, it was inspiring for the authors of [89] in developing a similar approach for the
study of real-time dynamics from the vacuum to excited states of Quantum Chromodynamics
in one spatial dimension.
The idea behind self-mitigation can be applied to other operators not only the time evolution
one, by simply creating an error estimation circuit that contains the operator circuit followed
by its inverse circuit, and adapt the self-mitigation relation accordingly in Equation 4.1 to
take into account the different number of gates.
In the last section we have presented an extension of this study to the case of 2-plaquette
lattice with a 16truncation of the jmaxcase. The future results of the calculation on the IBM
hardware will help understand if self-mitigation can mitigate the hardware error on much
larger and more complex circuits and since the time evolution circuit complexity comes from
the Wilson approach, (in which the system is described with a global basis). Consequently it
will make it clear if it is a feasible way to study the dynamics of SU(2) lattice gauge theory
with larger gauge truncations jmax>1/2.
In this work the use of quantum resources was rationed by analytically calculating the
time evolution operator instead of letting the Qiskit library calculate it from the Hamiltonian,
and by optimizing it in two ways: analytically and at the code level.
83

--- PAGE 99 ---
Analytically a matrix decomposition is chosen that requires the least number of gates and, by
rearranging the gate terms inside each single Suzuki-Trotter step to cancel CNOT gates and
combine rotation gates into one. At the code level CNOTs are eliminated between consecutive
time steps and Pauli gates are absorbed into rotation gates.
Despite, the many particle physics studies that have already been performed on the IBM
gate-based quantum hardware, future hardware extensions dealing with the hardware errors
are necessary to transform what is now an interesting and promising prototype in a tool
able to perform calculations that cannot be done with classical computers. In this direc-
tion a crucial turning point is represented by increasing the qubit connectivity limited to
3. Increasing the connectivity to a value larger than 10 will help not only to encode more
systems with more complex interactions but will make it possible to implement well known
error correction algorithms like for example the Shor’s one which requires 9 qubits for each
qubit to keep error free. Otherwise, increasing the qubits connectivity is challenging because
it requires rethinking the internal structure of the quantum processing unit (QPU). The
gates error rate should be reduced at a point that using many SWAPgates does not impact
thehardwarenoiselevel, sothatonecanincreasethequbit’sconnectivitybyusing SWAPgates.
Indeed, the IBM quantum development roadmap for the next half of the decade is quite
promising for lattice gauge theories because it goes towards the development of hardware with
more than 4000 qubits with important actions to reduce hardware noise and to developing
built-in error correction [190].
Looking forward, another important advancement is expected with the introduction of multi-
level quantum computational units called qudits of which the qubit is a 2-level unit. Qudits
will not only increase the computational capability to a much higher level but will make it
possible to increase the complexity of the system that can be studied. For example, a qutrit,
a quantum bit with three levels, will be perfectly suited to study Quantum Chromodynamics
because it will make it natural to encode a quark or a gluon with their three-valued colour
charge on a qutrit making the encoding scaling perfectly polynomial with the number of
particles.

Chapter 5
Conclusion
In this final chapter we first discuss the overall content of the thesis by recalling the main
rationale from the introduction that led to the use of two different quantum hardwares, the
SU(2) lattice gauge theory presented in chapter 2, then we summarize the results presented
in chapter 3 and 4 obtained with the D-Wave quantum annealer and the IBM gate-based
quantum computer. A brief critical comparison of the two hardwares is provided, and we
conclude by setting out some general perspectives on the future use of quantum hardware.
5.1 Synopsis of the thesis
In the Introduction 1 we briefly discussed how despite the success in understanding quan-
tum chromodynamics and other lattice gauge theories in the last 50 years of investigation,
the sign problem is, in fact, an insurmountable obstacle that prevents the study of the
real-time evolution of a theory, its phase diagram and other non-perturbative phenomena from
being explored. In this scenario, a unique opportunity comes from the ability of quantum
computers to store the theory Hilbert space in an exponentially more efficient way compared
to a classical computer, making it possible to use the Hamiltonian formulation for direct
numerical calculation, which is free from the sign problem, in place of the standard lattice
gauge theory path integral formulation based on numerical calculation using the Monte Carlo
method with importance sampling.
In Chapter 2, we introduced the SU(2) pure gauge lattice theory given by Kogut and
Susskind [120], describing in detail how to derive the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian
for a lattice made by a row of plaquettes with a fixed value of the gauge truncation jmax. To
facilitate the reader in the following chapters where quantum hardware are used to extract the
energy spectrum and the time evolution, the exact classical calculations of those observables
for the 2-plaquette case are given. In Figures 2.5, 2.6 we showed how the two different regimes
of the theory with the gauge coupling xeffected the time evolution. In Figure 2.7 we showed
how the energy spectrum of the theory for the 2-plaquette case as a function of the gauge
coupling xchanges when considering different values of the gauge truncation jmax. Finally, in
Figure 2.8 the phenomena of a traveling excitation for the jmax= 2case is shown.
85

--- PAGE 101 ---
In Chapter 3, we first described the main feature of the D-Wave quantum annealer [137]
and then we discussed in details how to use the hardware to find the ground state of a
generic Hamiltonian by implementing the QAE algorithm Ref. [149–153] and the extension
we developed AQAE [63]. The necessary algorithm steps were shown in Figures 3.2, 3.3 and
3.4. These algorithms were then used to calculate the energy spectrum of the theory as shown
in Figures 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9, and those results were used to calculate the vacuum
expectation value of the Hamiltonian as a function of the gauge coupling xfor different
values of the gauge truncation jand for longer lattices as shown in Figures 3.11 and 3.12,
respectively. Finally, using the Kitaev-Feynman clock states [171–174] the probability of
oscillations between two excited states in real-time were obtained as shown in Figure 3.14
and 3.15.
In Chapter 4, we first introduced the essential features of the IBM gate-based quantum
computer [138] needed to encode a generic operator on the hardware. Then, we addressed
the hardware errors and consequently the necessary error mitigation techniques, showing
the one we introduced self-mitigation 4.2, along with the other well-known ones. How to
compute on the hardware the real-time evolution of the theory was discussed in details by
presenting the result in Figure 4.9 for the 2-plaquette case with jmax= 1/2and, an example
of real-time traveling excitation is shown in Figure 4.10. The study of the real-time evolution
was extended to the 5-plaquette case with jmax= 1/2in Figure 4.12. Finally, the essential
elements for calculating the time evolution for the case of 2-plaquette lattice considering a
16×16truncation of the jmax= 3/2are shown with the targeted time evolution in Figure 4.15.
5.2 Critical comparison between D-Wave and IBM
Having studied the SU(2) lattice gauge theory on two different NISQ quantum hardwares,
even though we did not study the exact same observables, it provides us with a unique oppor-
tunity to compare the two quantum hardwares and discuss the advantage and disadvantages.
The main advantage of using the D-Wave annealer is that the Hamiltonian or any op-
erator matrix representation can be encoded directly on the hardware as opposed to the
IBM gate-based quantum computer where it has to be first decomposed in the available
quantum gates. Secondly the D-Wave hardware can produce precise and accurate results
without using any error mitigation techniques. Nevertheless, there are two main drawbacks
that limit its usability: firstly, it is not a universal quantum annealer, in fact only oper-
ators with non-positive off-diagonal elements, called a stoquastic matrix, can be studied
efficiently. Additionally there is a mild sign problem that severely limits the accuracy of
the results. Secondly, the lack of freedom to directly interact with the qubit states makes
it impossible to exploit qubit superposition and qubit entanglement, resulting in difficulties
in designing computational algorithms that have polynomial scaling with the size of the system.
In contrast, the IBM gate-based quantum hardware is a universal quantum computer, giving
freedom to encode any operators on the hardware once it is decomposed in gates. Unlike
86

--- PAGE 102 ---
D-Wave, on IBM’s hardware it is possible to directly access and change the state of each qubit
and one can formulate algorithms with polynomial scaling, which perform better than the
classical one. The major disadvantage of IBM hardware is the difficulty to extract results in
good agreement with the exact result without the use of many error mitigation techniques due
to the large plethora of different hardware errors. In fact, the hardware is still noisy, and in
the interlude until a definitive error correction protocol is introduced, many problem-specific
error mitigation techniques need to be formulated and adopted, but often with the drawback
of requiring a large amount of quantum resources, causing the full encoding to lose its initial
polynomial scaling with the system size.
So ultimately, if D-Wave’s functionality is not extended, it will not be as useful as the
IBM hardware in envisioning new ways to investigate unanswered particle physics questions.
5.3 Overall prospects for the future
The real era of quantum computers has not yet begun, we are just at the beginning of
the preparatory phase, what is called the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, where the
usability of the few prototypes of quantum hardware limited by the few noisy resources is
under exploration. Therefore at least for the next decades classical computations will retain
their predominant role in understanding nature.
However, in keeping with the possibilities of the NISQ era, over the last four years many
theories based on the U(1), SU(2) and SU(3) groups relevant to particle physics have been
encoded on the available NISQ quantum hardware such as quantum annealing and gate-based
quantum computers, but all those theories have been studied on a small one-dimensional
lattice. Thus, the first natural challenge is to extend those previous studies to longer one-
dimensional spatial lattices and, later, to two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattices.
The second challenge is to extend those previous studies to theories with terms describing
phenomena that cannot be studied on large lattices using a classical computer due to the sign
problem and/or an exponential growth of computational resources, for example by adding a
chemical potential.
These will be the subject of research in the next few years or even decade, because every
time the theory is extended to larger dimensions there is a need to reformulate its coding
respecting the characteristics of the hardware, and noisy hardware will require adapting error
mitigation techniques previously formulated and more will likely develop new error mitigation
techniques that can handle much larger noise from a more complex system that will inevitably
require more qubits and larger circuits than in the one-dimensional case. This future study
will be greatly simplified if quantum hardware has a reduced error rate and increased qubit
connectivity in the coming years.
We should bear in mind that these future developments should be regarded as a preparatory
exploration of quantum resources in the meantime that quantum hardware becomes fault-
tolerant. Indeed it is insufficient to think of quantum computing as a "brute force" approach
to look for a solution to problems that cannot be solved using the classical computer due to
87

--- PAGE 103 ---
the highly intensive computational resources required.
Instead, quantum computers should induce a new paradigm in the study not only of particle
physics but more generally in the understanding of nature, in which new formulations and
new approaches are developed by exploiting quantum information properties. This is similar
to what happened with the introduction of the classical computer, which led Stanislaw Ulam
[191] in 1948 to invent the Markov chain Monte Carlo method that was implemented on the
ENIAC computer [192], and later in the field of LGT led Michael Creutz in 1979 to study a
SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory. It paved the way for other researchers to use the 1974 Kenneth
Wilson discretization of quantum chromodynamics and gauge theory from first principles to
perform numerical studies on the classical computers available at that time, giving rise to
Lattice QCD, something that was never thought before.
This will inevitably require a collective creative effort, but that is what scientists are here for,
to introduce new ideas and/or new points of view on nature, and fortunately there are many
who will be harnessing the quantum computing era in the decades to come.

Appendix A
Explanation on how to derive the SU(2)
pure gauge lattice Hamiltonian
In this appendix we present an explanation on how to obtain the 2-dimensional SU(2)
pure gauge theory Hamiltonian present in Eq. 2.1:
ˆH=g2
2 X
i=linksˆE2
i−2xX
i=plaquettesˆ□i!
(A.1)
starting from the Lagrangian density in the continuum. Before doing that, it is important to
remind the reader that the original formulation can be found in "Hamiltonian formulation of
Wilson’s lattice gauge theories" by John Kogut and Leonard Susskind [120], where an analogy
with the quantum rigid rotator is used to justify the introduction of the pure gauge-field term.
Following the Yang-Mills approach a theory can be built by requiring the fields describ-
ing the particles to be gauge invariant under the chosen group. Therefore for our case the
continuum SU(2) non-Abelian Lagrangian density in presence of fermions is:
L=−1
2Ncg2Fc
µν(x)Fc µν(x) +X
fψf(x)(i γµDµ−mf)ψf(x) (A.2)
where gis the gauge coupling, Ncis a numeric constant indicating the number of colors that
for SU(2) is 2, and
Fc
µν(x) =∂µAc
ν(x)−∂νAc
µ(x) +ig[Ac
µ(x), Ac
ν(x)] (A.3)
is the field strength tensor, Aµ(x)is the gauge boson field and cis the color index with value
c= 1,2.
ψf(x)is a fermion quark field with mass mf,fspecifies the fermion flavour, and Dµ=
∂µ−igσcAc
µis the covariant derivative.
The gauge invariance of the Lagrangian under SU(2) is guaranteed by the following gauge
89

--- PAGE 105 ---
transformation of its elements:
ψ(x)→ψ′(x) = Ω( x)ψ(x), (A.4)
ψ(x)′→ψ(x)Ω†(x), (A.5)
Dµ→D′
µψ′(x) = Ω( x)DµΩ(x)†, (A.6)
Ac
µ(x)→Ac
µ(x)′= Ω(x)Ac
µ(x)Ω(x)†+i(∂µΩ(x)) Ω(x)†. (A.7)
where Ω(x)belongs to the fundamental representation of SU(2), and can be written as
Ω(x)≡e−iσbθb(x)where ωbare the 3 gauge transformation parameters, and σbwith b= 1,2,3
are the Lie algebra generators, that for SU(2) are the Pauli matrices.
Since we are interested in a pure-gauge theory we put the fermion field, ψfto zero, therefore
our starting point is:
L=−1
4Fc
µν(x)Fc µν(x) (A.8)
TheHamiltoniandensitycanbeobtainedbysimplyusingthedefinitionandtheEuler-Lagrange

=
−1
2∂0Aµ(x)∂0Aµ(x) +1

(A.9)
Therefore the Hamiltonian is obtained by spatially integrating the Hamiltonian density:
H=Z
dDxH=Z

4Fc

where Dis the dimension of the chosen spacetime.
We can now expand the field strength tensor so that we can separate the terms containing
time derivative of the fields Aµ(x)from the one without.

(A.11)
where in the second passage we used the antisymmetry of the strength tensor Fc
µν(x) =
−Fc
νµ(x)to prove that Fc
0j(x)Fc0j(x) =Fc
i0(x)Fc i0(x), where iandjare dummy indices.
Since we are free to fix the gauge, we can use it to simplify the calculations. We de-
cide to work in the temporal in which A0(x)is set to zero. Even if we are always free to
choose the gauge, the conjugate field of Ac
0(x),Π0=δL/δ(∂0Ac
0(x))is zero, therefore Ac
0(x)
is not a true canonic field, therefore setting it to zero by choosing the temporal gauge solves
this conceptual problem as well.
90

--- PAGE 106 ---
Furthermore, the electric field can be written using the potentials as Ei(x) =−∇ϕ(x)·
ˆi−∂Ai(x)/∂t, but with no present charges, it reduces to Ei(x) =−∂0Ai(x).
In the temporal gauge, the strength tensor components F00= 0andF0i=∂iA0(x)−∂iA0(x) =
∂0Ai(x). This leads to F0iF0i=E2
iand therefore the Hamiltonian is:
H=Z
dDx1
2E2
i(x) +1
4Fc
ij(x)Fc ij(x) (A.12)
Since in the following discussion the color index cdoes not play a crucial role, we drop
it to simplify the notation. We can start noticing that the main distinction between the
two terms is that the first term contains time derivative of the field Aµ(x)while the second not.
It is interesting to notice that in the Abelian case the second term would be equal to
the square of the magnetic flux field B(x)because Fij=−ϵijkBk. It should be now evident
why it is common to call the Hamiltonian terms even of the non-Abelian case as chromoelectric
and chromomagnetic respectively for the first and second term.
Before proceeding to introduce the lattice and discretize the Hamiltonian, it is necessary
to change from the Minkowski to the Euclidian space and perform the Wick rotation that
changes the time from real to imaginary. This means:
x0→ − ix0, (A.13)
A0(x)→iA0(x), (A.14)
∂0→i∂0. (A.15)
This has the consequence that Ei(x) =−i∂0Ai(x)but no effect on Ei(x)2, therefore the
Hamiltonian finally reads:
H=Z
dDx1
2E2
i(x) +1
4Fij(x)Fij(x) (A.16)
The hypercubic lattice with linear sizes Lµand lattice and spacing athat discretizes the
spacetime is formally defined as:
Λ ={xµ=anµ|nµ= 0,1, . . . L µ/a} (A.17)
When we discretize the continuum spacetime with a D-dimensional lattice having lattice
spacing a, the fundamental discretization prescription adopted are
xµ→nµa , (A.18)Z
dDx . . . →aDX
n. . . , (A.19)
∂µψ(x)→1
2a(ψ(n+ ˆµ)−ψ(n−ˆµ)) +O(a2), (A.20)
91

--- PAGE 107 ---
which are very handy for showing that the lattice theory reproduces the continuum theory.
A gauge field as element of SU(2) is attached at each link of the discretized D-dimensional
spacetime. This element is called link variable and indicated with Uµ(n), which connects the
points nandn+ ˆµalong the lattice direction µ.
The formal connection between the continuum and the discretized lattice theory is expressed
in the relation between the link variable Uµ(n)and the gauge boson field Aµ(n):
Uµ(n) =exp(iagA µ(n)) (A.21)
thatisthelatticeversionoftheSchwingerlineintegralinthecontinuumtheory eiPRx+aˆµ
xdxµAµ(x)
Assuming that in the limit a→0the field Aµ(n)became sufficiently smooth, so that it can
be expanded as:
Aν(n+ ˆµ) =Aν(n) +a∂µAν(n) +O(a2) (A.22)
Since we are working in the temporal gauge, from equation Eq. A.21 implies that all the link
variable along the temporal direction, U0(n)are set to the identity, therefore they do not play
any role.
In the pure gauge lattice theory an important role is played by the smallest product of
link variables along a square, called plaquette variable:
Uµν(n) =Uµ(n)Uν(n+ ˆµ)U†
µ(n+ ˆν)U†
ν(n) (A.23)
its importance can be found in its connection with the discrete form of the strength tensor,
which can be obtained by substituting in its definition the expression of the link variable in
Eq. A.21, obtaining:
Uµν(n) =eiagA µ(n)eiagA ν(n+ˆµ)e−iagA µ(n+ˆν)e−iagA ν(n)(A.24)
to expand the product, we have to keep in mind that there are non-commuting terms, therefore
we will use the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula:
eAeB≈eA+B+1
2[A,B]+1
12([A,[A,B]]+[B,[A,B]])+···(A.25)
For our specific case that has four operators can be generalized to:
eAeBeCeD≈eA+B+C+D+1
2([A,B]+[A,C]+[A,D]+[B,C]+[B,D]+[C,D])+···(A.26)
Using it in Eq. A.24 we obtain:
Uµν(n) =eiagA µ(n)eiagA ν(n+ˆµ)e−iagA µ(n+ˆν)e−iagA ν(n)
≈exp(iag{Aµ(n) +Aν(n+ ˆµ)−Aµ(n+ ˆν)−Aν(n)}+

+O(a3))(A.27)
92

--- PAGE 108 ---
where the terms with shifted arguments of the form Aµ(n+ˆν)can be expanded with the
use of Eq. A.22, therefore after few simplifications we obtain:
Uµν(n)≈exp(ia2g{∂µAν(n)−∂νAµ(n)}+
−1
2a2g2{2 [Aµ(n), Aν(n+ ˆµ)] +a[Aµ(n), Aν(n)] +a2[Aµ(n), Aν(n)]}+O(a3)) =
= exp( ia2g{∂µAν(n)−∂νAµ(n) +ig[Aµ(n), Aν(n)]}+O(a3))
(A.28)
where the terms inside the curly brackets is the lattice field strength tensor Fµν(n)and the
relation between the plaquette variable and the lattice field strength tensor reads:
Uµν(n) = exp( ia2gFµν(n) +O(a3) (A.29)
where the lattice field strength tensor is simply:
Fµν(n) =∂µAν(n)−∂νAµ(n) +ig[Aµ(n), Aν(n)] (A.30)
The field strength can be seen as a generalized curl of the vector potential, and its volume
integration can be viewed as the integration of the vector potential in a closed loop. This is
the underlying Wilson’s reasoning used in his proposal for a pure gauge lattice Lagrangian as
the sum of product of gauge fields Uµ(n)around a square plaquette.
This expression can be used to derive the lattice electric field, that is
F0i(n) =∂0Ai(n)−∂iA0(n) +ig[A0(n), Ai(n)] =∂0Ai(n) =−Ei(n)(A.31)
were in the second step we use the fact that we have chosen the temporal gauge, A0= 0.
The lattice chromoelectric part of the Hamiltonian can be now written as:
Z
dDx1
2E2
i(x)→HE=aDX
nE2
i(n) (A.32)
where the sum is the discretization of the D-dimensional integral.
We can now proceed to write the second term in the Hamiltonian, FijFij, using the plaquette
operator defined as trace of a plaquette variable:
ˆUµν=Tr[Uµν] =Tr
exp 
ia2gFµν+O(a3)
(A.33)
where the trace ensure that the operator is gauge invariant, in the SU(2) color space.
At the lowest order in the lattice spacing athe following relation holds:
ˆUµν(n) +ˆU†
µν(n) =Tr
21−a4g2Fµν(n)Fµν(n) +O(a6)
(A.34)
therefore:
Tr[Fµν(n)Fµν(n)] =4−
ˆUµν(n) +ˆUµν(n)†
a4g2+O(a6) (A.35)
93

--- PAGE 109 ---
The term Fij(n)Fij(n)can now be written as:
Tr
Fij(n)Fij(n)
=4−
ˆUij(n) +ˆUij(n)†
a4g2+O(a6) =4−2ˆ□(n)
a4g2+O(a6)(A.36)
where in the second step we use the fact that for SU(2)ˆUµν(n) =ˆU†
µν(n)and called ˆUij(n)as
ˆ□(n), which is a only-spatial plaquette operator, made by only link variable laying on the
spatial directions.
The lattice chromomagnetic part of the Hamiltonian can be written as:
Z
dDx1
4Fij(x)Fij(x)→HB=aDX
n−1
42
a4g2ˆ□(n) (A.37)
where we dropped the numeric constant, 4/(a4g2), because it contributes only a constant
energy shift.
Finally, adding HEandHBthe SU(2) lattice Hamiltonian is:

where in the first step we putted in highlighted g2/2while in the second step we multiplied
and divided by 4 so that in the second term there is a 4/g4that is 2xwith x= 2/g4.
Rescaling the chromoelectric field as2
gEi(n)
−→Ei(n), dropping the numeric multi-
plicative constant 1/4, set the dimension to D= 2, and setting the lattice spacing ato 1, we
finally obtain the expression used for the lattice SU(2) Hamiltonian:
H=g2
2X
nE2
i(n)−2xˆ□(n) (A.39)
where one has to keep in mind that for each node none has to sum the contributions of the
electric field from each link composing the space.
Even if an extra dimensionless numerical constant in the field is not important and the
notation is clear, a final comment about the rescaling of the chromoelectric field is needed. In
this discussion we have tried to obtain the final expression of Hin Eq. A.39 starting from its
continuum formulation and limiting the ad hoc constant fixing only on the last step, as we
did for the rescaling of the field. It is common in the literature to avoid rescaling the field as:

Deriving the plaquette operator matrix

In this appendix1we present a derivation of the plaquette operator matrix elements.
In deriving the action of the plaquette operator on the matrix element we consider a one-
dimensional lattice made by a single row of plaquettes with periodic boundary conditions in
the longitudinal direction. Since the derivation is quite cumbersome it is important to have a
clear picture of the labelling of the links, nodes and plaquettes as denoted in Figure B.1:

Results for ⟨ψfinal|□i|ψinitial⟩with i= 2,3,4can be obtained simply by translation sym-
metry from the i= 1result or by explicit calculation. It is important to notice that this can
be quite a challenging and error prone calculation, therefore a more practical notation can be
useful to this scope. Let’s consider a generic plaquette (□p)on a generic lattice with links
labelled as in Figure B.2:
BL B BR• •TL T TR• •

Figure B.2: A single plaquette with link labelled for an easy generalization of ⟨ψfinal|□p|ψinitial⟩

that is a short notation for: top left (TL), top (T), top right (TR), left (L), right (R), bottom
left (BL), bottom (B) and bottom right (BR).

Appendix C
State generator algorithm
In this appendix we describe the algorithms developed and used to derive the physical
states and the matrix representation of an SU(2) lattice gauge theory with Hamiltonian as:
ˆH=g2
2 X
i=linksˆE2
i−2xX
i=plaquettesˆ□i!
(C.1)
In the angular momentum formulation, a generic state of a 2-dimensional lattice made by N
links arranged in plaquettes can be represented as:
|ψ⟩=|j1, m1, m′
1⟩|j2, m2, m′
2⟩. . .|jN, mN, m′
N⟩. (C.2)
We have shown in section 2.2 that the matrix element of the operators inside the Hamiltonian
do not depend on the two projection (m, m′)at the end of each link, therefore a state is
simply labelled as:
|ψ⟩=|j1, j2, . . . , j N⟩ (C.3)
This state is a physical state only if it respects the SU(2) Gauss’s law at each node. This is
expressed by forcing the links joining at a node to respect the angular momentum composition
rule.
To better express the restriction at a code we should consider that on a generic 2-dimensional
lattice there are two types of nodes depending on how many links touch it:
j1•j2
j1j3
•
j2
Figure C.1: The two possible type of nodes in a 1-dimensional lattice made by a row of
plaquettes. On the left a 2-link node while on the right a 3-link node where j1,j2andj3are
generic links joining at the nodes.
We can label them as a 2-link node if two links touch it and a 3-link node if instead three
links touch it. The angular momentum composition rule can be expressed for each node type
100

--- PAGE 116 ---
as:
2-link node j1==j2 (C.4)
3-link node j3∈ {|j1−j2|,|j1−j2|+ 1, . . . , j 1+j2}
These equations are sufficient to generate the physical states of the system once they are
applied at each node of the lattice.
The algorithm finds the physical states by first generating all the possible candidate states
|phy >giving each link a j value from 0 up to a fixed jmaxby step of 1/2and secondly by
checking that each link’s value satisfies the angular momentum composition rule at each node
they touch. For a lattice with N links organized in plaquettes the algorithm in pseudocode
reads:
Algorithm 1 Calculate physical states SU(2) Hamiltonian Eq. C.1
for(j1, j2, . . . , j N)each with value from 0 to jmaxby step of 1/2 do
if(all 2LN are true) and (all 3LN are true) then
(j1, j2, . . . , j N)belong to the Hilbert space of the theory
else
it is not a physical state, discard it.
end if
end for
where 2LN and 3LN are the 2-link and 3-link node function respectively of Eq. C.4.
There are two final observations: The algorithm could have been written without using
the result for which the matrix element of the Hamiltonian does not depend on the value of
the two projections m, m′. Therefore a more general algorithm could use the more cumbersome
notation |ψ⟩=|jA, mA, m′
A⟩|jB, mB, m′
B⟩. . .|jL, mL, m′
L⟩and impose the SU(2) Gauss’s law
by using for each node a 3j symbol as a restriction on each node. In this way the computation
is massive and consequently the running time will be extremely large, because the algorithm
has to explore all the possible values for m, m′∈(−j,−j+ 1/2, . . . , j )for each value jof
each link in the lattice.
Secondly the algorithm could be easily extended to 2 and 3 dimensional lattices by in-
troducing 4-link and n-link nodes by simply generalizing the link function and by deriving
the plaquette contribution ⟨ψfinal|□p|ψinitial⟩for a generic plaquette surrounded by 4 and n
plaquettes respectively.
C.1 Using the algorithm for 3 plaquettes
In this section we show an example of how to use the algorithm to derive the states and
the Hamiltonian representation of a 3-plaquette lattice with closed boundary condition (CBC)
andjmax= 1/2truncation.

Figure C.2: A 3-plaquette lattice with closed boundary condition. Each plaquette is indicated
by the label in the center of each square, each link by the letter at the middle point and,
nodes by the closest number.
Hence a global state on this lattice is represented using the following notation:
|ψ⟩=|ja, jb, jc, jd, je, jf, jg, jh, ji, jl⟩ (C.5)
The selected lattice has 8 nodes, 4 2-link nodes (1,2,7,8) and 4 3-link nodes (3,4,5,6) and for
each of them we impose the Gauss’s law. The algorithm for this case reads:

(ja, jb, jc, jd, je, jf, jg, jh, ji, jl)belong to the Hilbert space of the theory

discard it.

where we can see that starting from the vacuum (state 1), we see a state with the right
plaquette switched “on” (state 2), then the center plaquette “on” (state 3) and so on until the
last one where left and right plaquette are switched “on”.
The matrix representation can be calculated using these states and the equation for the
matrix element of the operators ˆE2
iandˆ□pi.
The chromoelectric part is simply:
⟨ψfinal|X
iˆE2
i|ψinitial⟩=lX
i=aji(ji+ 1)δfinal,initial. (C.7)
For the contribution of the chromomagnetic part we have to obtain the expression for each
plaquette on this specific lattice configuration. To do that we use the notation in Appendix B
Eq. B.18, and we get that the first plaquette is:
⟨ψfinal|□p1|ψinitial⟩= (−1)jf+2Jb+2Jc+2ja+2jd

where the extra deltas at the end of each plaquette are there to remind us that the plaquette
contribution is non-zero only if the links in |ψinitial⟩and|ψfinal⟩external to the acting plaquette
have the same values. This is important if we use a code to perform the calculation.
Now, a simple code can ease us from the burden of computing this series of tedious calculations.
This code joined together with the one implementing the physical state algorithm form the
3-plaquette code for an SU(2) lattice gauge theory with closed boundary condition and tunable
jmax.

The code can be used to generate the Hamiltonian for the case of jmax= 1that has

Appendix D
Decomposing an operator in Pauli gates
In this section we discuss a simple way to decompose a generic operator using the identity
and the Pauli gates I, X, Y, Z in a way that is easy to code and therefore calculate by software.
Finally, we present an algorithm that finds the gate decompositions with a small number of
gates. Let’s consider a generic observable Orepresented by a 2×2matrix:
ˆO.=a b
c d
(D.1)
How can we decompose this observable using only I,X,Y and Z? One could be tempted to
create a system of equations and solve it. However, there is a simpler way that can be easily
generalized to any observables represented by a 4×4matrix or a 2n×2n. Starting from the
2×2case we can simply notice that the observable is decomposable as:
ˆO.=a1 0
0 0
+b0 1
0 0
+c0 0
1 0
+d0 0
0 1
(D.2)
where each element of the basis can be simply labelled based on the position of the 1 as:
TL=1 0
0 0
, TR =0 1
0 0
, BL =0 0
1 0
, BR =0 0
0 1
(D.3)
Looking to the matrix representation of the chosen gates:
I=1 0
0 1
, X =0 1
1 0
, Y =0−i
i0
, Z =1 0
0−1
(D.4)
the basis can be rewritten using the chosen gates as:
TL=I+Z
2, TR =X+iY
2, BL =X−iY
2, BR =I−Z
2(D.5)
We then define what we call the gate decomposer labelled as:
GD 2×2=TL TR
BL BR
=(I+Z)/2 (X+iY)/2
(X−iY)/2 (I−Z)/2
(D.6)
105

--- PAGE 121 ---
where the square brackets in place of more common round brackets are used to make clear that
it is not a common matrix but a matrix of matrices. Finally the operator can be decomposed
using the gates as:
ˆO.=GD 2×2⊙ˆO=X
i,j(GD 2×2)i,jOi,j (D.7)
where ⊙is the element-wise product or Hadamard product.
Executing all of the products, the operator reads:
ˆO.=1
2((b+c)X+i(b−c)Y+ (a−d)Z+ (a+d)I) (D.8)
To extend this approach to a generic operator represented by a 4×4matrix, it is enough
to rewrite the basis in gates. It is here that this method is quite effective, because there is
a simple way to obtain the basis element of the 4×4from the one of the 2×2. The first
element of the 4×4can be written as:

1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
=1 0
0 0
⊗1 0
0 0
=TL⊗TL (D.9)
=1
4(I⊗I+I⊗Z+Z⊗I+Z⊗Z) (D.10)
and similarly, the other elements of the basis are simply made by space ordered products, for
example:

0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
=0 1
0 0
⊗0 0
1 0
=TR⊗BL (D.11)
=1
4(X⊗X−iX⊗Y+iY⊗X+Y⊗Y) (D.12)
TheGD 4×4is built using GD 2×2as follows:
GD 4×4=GD 2×2⊗GD 2×2=
TL⊗TL TL ⊗TR TR ⊗TL TR ⊗TR
TL⊗BL TL ⊗BR TR ⊗BL TR ⊗BR
BL⊗TL BL ⊗TR BR ⊗TL BR ⊗TR
BL⊗BL BL ⊗BR BR ⊗BL BR ⊗BR
(D.13)
by substituting the values of TL, TR, BL, BR in terms of I, X, Y, Z one has GD 4×4written
in gates.
The result can be easily extended to 2n×2nas:
GD 2n×2n=GD 2×2⊗GD 2×2⊗ ··· ⊗ GD 2×2| {z }
n(D.14)
A few observations are necessary: first this strategy is meant to be used on a calculator, where
one has pre-calculated the GD n×nand then use it to decompose the matrix representation of
106

--- PAGE 122 ---
any observables with the same dimension. Secondly, in using this method one can optimize the
calculation by using the fact that any operator is Hermitian therefore one can calculate only
the upper triangular part and obtain the lower triangular part as the Hermitian conjugate of
the upper one.
This gate decomposer is part of an algorithm that finds the minimal possible gate decomposi-
tion of an observable by finding the matrix representation that requires the smallest number
of gates. This search is done by permuting the states ordered in the basis used to represent
the observables.
Algorithm 3
forall the permutation of the basis do
decompose the operator representation in gates
ifthe number of gates needed is less that the original decomposition then
save it
end if
end for
This algorithm is computationally expensive because given a basis with nstates it needs
to perform n!checks. In case the number of needed permutations is too large one can opt to
access a few of them randomly and stop the search once a reasonably small number of gates
needed is reached.
Furthermore, whenever the system size allows access to all or a large part of permutations, it
is better to choose among the ones with the same small number of gates as the permutation
that contains the largest number of native gates present on the specific hardware, so that the
circuit will be executed on the hardware without using extra gates necessary to convert it
using native gates.
A final observation is that, this algorithm uses a large quantity of classical resources to
minimize the circuit that encodes the theory on a quantum computer. This sounds like a
contradiction to the use of quantum computers, which instead should have been used in places
where classical computer needs large resources. This contradiction is only apparent because
the quantum computers of the NISQ era are noisy prototypes of what an actual quantum
computer will be. Therefore in using these prototypes we should consider any possible way to
ration the use of the few quantum resources available.

Appendix E
Exponential of combinations of Pauli
gates
In this section we present a general way to exactly calculate the exponential of a com-
bination of Pauli gates and show how to express it in terms of controlled Pauli X gates, a
rotation gate and other single gates like Hadamard and Sgates. These tedious calculations
are necessary not only to encode the time evolution operator on the hardware, but most
importantly, to optimize the circuit by reducing the necessary number of gates, especially the
noisiest ones: the CNOT and the SWAPgate.
The most fundamental relation to prove is how to express the exponential of a single Pauli
gate indicated as A=X, Y, Z,exp(−iθA)in terms of SU(2)rotation gates.
This can be simply proved by Taylor expanding the exponential as:
e−iθA=I−iθA+. . .+−inθn
n!An+. . . (E.1)
and using the idempotent property of the operators A2=A, the expression can be rearranged
as:
e−iθA=I X
neven−inθn
n!!
−i X
nodd−in−1θn
n!!
= cos( θ)I−i sin(θ)A (E.2)
where in the last line we recognise that the terms inside the parenthesis are the Taylor
expansion of cos(θ)andsin(θ)respectively.
To see how the previous expression leads to single qubit rotation gates, it is enough to
substitute any of the Pauli operators in place of Aand perform the algebra as:
e−iθX=cos(θ)−i sin(θ)
−i sin(θ) cos( θ)
≡RX(2θ), (E.3)
e−iθY=cos(θ)sin(θ)
sin(θ) cos( θ)
≡RY(2θ), (E.4)
e−iθZ=cos(θ)−i sin(θ) 0
0 cos( θ) +i sin(θ)
≡RZ(2θ) (E.5)
108

--- PAGE 124 ---
where the rotations are not the common rotations of the real Euclidean space based on SO(3)
but are spin-1/2 rotations based on SU(2).
The result can be simply extended to a system with two qubits by simply following the
same calculation in Equation E.2, obtaining:
e−iθB⊗A=cos(θ)I⊗I−i sin(θ)B⊗A (E.6)
where the simple relation (B⊗A)n= (Bn⊗An)was used.
This expression can be rewritten using only a rotation gate and pairs of CNOT gates with
the help of few identities, which are necessary to transform B⊗Ainto a pair of CNOT gates,
a Pauli gate and one identity gate.
The possible identities using only controlled Pauli X gates are:
Xk⊗Xj=CX jkIk⊗XjCX jk, (E.7)
Zj⊗Zk=CX jkIj⊗ZkCX jk, (E.8)
Xk⊗Yj=CX jkIj⊗YkCX jk, (E.9)
Zk⊗Yj=CX kjIj⊗YkCX kj. (E.10)
which can be verified by performing the matrix multiplications.
To see how this process works it is easier to explain with an example,
e−iθX⊗Y=cos(θ)I⊗I−i sin(θ)X⊗Y
Using Equation E.9 the two Pauli gates in the second term are rewritten as
X1⊗Y0=CX 10(I1⊗Y0)CX 10, leading to:
e−iθX1⊗Y0=cos(θ)I1⊗I0−i sin(θ)CX 01I1⊗Y0CX 01=
=CX 10I1⊗[cos(θ)I0−i sin(θ)Y0]CX 01=
=CX 01I1⊗RY0(2θ)CX 01 (E.11)
where in the second last equation we used the relation CX jk(Ij⊗Ik)CX jk= (Ij⊗Ik)to
bring the CXpair outside, and finally recognized the RYgate inside the square parenthesis.
Finally its circuit is represented in Figure E.1:
q0
q1RY(2θ)

are labelled q0andq1respectively.

--- PAGE 125 ---
For the case there are two combinations of gates X⊗ZorY⊗Ywhose exponential
cannot be rewritten using the relations in Equation E.7. For these two combinations one can
first rewrite them using the following fundamental identities between Pauli gates and the
Hadamard gate:
X=HZH , (E.12)
Y=−HY H , (E.13)
Z=−HXH , (E.14)
or the identities between Pauli gates and the Sgate:
X=−SY S†, (E.15)
Y=SXS†, (E.16)
Z=SXS†, (E.17)
which both sets can be proved by simply performing the matrix multiplication.
Using those relations X⊗ZorY⊗Ycan be rewritten for example in terms of two Z
gates:
X⊗Z= (H⊗I) (Z⊗Z) (H⊗I), (E.18)
Y⊗Y= (SH⊗SH) (Z⊗Z) (HS†⊗HS†), (E.19)
and now they can be exponentiated using the relations in Equation E.8 obtaining:
e−iθXj⊗Zk= (Hj⊗Ik)(CX jkIj⊗RZk(2θ)CX jk)(Hj⊗Ik), (E.20)
e−iθYj⊗Yk= (SjHj⊗SkHk)(CX jkIj⊗RZk(2θ)CX jk)(HjS†
j⊗HkS†

whose circuit representations are given in Figure E.2:

e−iθYj⊗Ykon the right, expressed using a pair of CX,a rotation about the Z-axis RYand pairs
of Hadamard gates HandSgates. The first qubit is labelled qkwhile the second as qj.
These results can be extended to a system with more than one qubit, in fact the exponential
of a longer combination of Pauli gates W⊗ ··· ⊗ B . . . A, where Aacts on the first qubit and
Won the last one, can expressed as:
e−iθW⊗I⊗...⊗A=cos(θ)I⊗I⊗. . .⊗I−i sin(θ)W⊗I⊗. . .⊗A (E.22)

--- PAGE 126 ---
This expression can be rewritten using only a rotation gate and pairs of CXgates with the
help of a few identities necessary to transform the gates in the second term into a combination
ofCXgates and all the Pauli gates into identity gates except one.
To perform this calculation one can use the relations in Equation E.7 applying them to
pair of consecutive gates or, use the following generalization to non-consecutive pairs:
Xk⊗[G]⊗Xj=CjkIk⊗[G]⊗XjCjk, (E.23)
Zj⊗[G]⊗Zk=CjkIj⊗[G]⊗ZkCjk, (E.24)
Xk⊗[G]⊗Yj=CjkIk⊗[G]⊗YjCjk, (E.25)
Zk⊗[G]⊗Yj=CkjIj⊗[G]⊗YkCkj. (E.26)
where [G]indicates a generic set of Pauli gates that is between the operators considered.
To see how these identities are used it is worth considering an example e−iθZ2⊗Y1⊗Z0. The
three operators can be written by using the relation in Equation E.23, contracting the outside
operators first:
Z2⊗Y1⊗Z0=CX 20(I2⊗Y1⊗Z0)CX 20
=CX 20(I2⊗[CX 01Y1⊗I0CX 01])CX 20(E.27)
inserting this expression into Equation E.22 leads to:
e−iθZ2⊗Y1⊗Z0=CX 20(I2⊗[CX 01RY1(2θ)⊗I0CX 01])CX 20 (E.28)
Instead contracting consecutive pairs:
Z2⊗Y1⊗Z0=CX 01Z2⊗Y1⊗I0CX 01
=CX 01(CX 21I2⊗Y1CX 21)⊗I0CX 01(E.29)
inserting this other expression into Equation E.22 leads to:
e−iθZ2⊗Y1⊗Z0=CX 01(CX 21I2⊗RY1(2θ)CX 21)⊗I0CX 01 (E.30)
The circuit representation of these two decompositions are shown in Figure E.3:

Figure E.3: Three-qubit circuit representations for the operator e−iθZ2⊗Y1⊗Z0on a three qubits
system. On the left the circuit obtained by using external contraction, while on the right
the circuit using consecutive contractions. Both circuits have the same number of gates and
require the same qubit connectivity, therefore standing alone are computationally equivalent,
but instead if part of a larger circuit, one could be better than the other if the number of
gates is reduced when combined with other circuits.
The circuits in Figure E.3 are a clear examples showing that there can be more than one
circuit represented for a given operator. This has important implications in terms of better use
of the quantum resources, because one circuit can require the least number of gates; another
can use only gates that are native for a specific hardware, making it computationally cheaper
and less noisy to run; or another one uses only gates that respect the qubits connectivity
present on the hardware, avoiding the use of SWAPgates. Furthermore, exploring different
circuit representations is particularly valuable while using NISQ era hardware, because it
can help reduce the number of gates by allowing cancellations among terms composing the
full circuit. Therefore in designing a circuit one has to consider that not all those positive
characteristics are shared by the same circuit, hence a trade-off between the different circuits
has to be done, as it is necessary in developing the time evolution circuits presented in this
chapter.

Appendix F
2-plaquette using a 16×16truncation of
thejmax= 3/2
In this appendix a complete description of a single step first order Suzuki-Trotter real-time
circuit for the 2-plaquette lattice using a 16×16jmax= 3/2truncation is given.
In listing each circuit a few notational conventions are used:
•The subscript following a rotation gate, an H,SandS†indicates the qubit on which the
gate acts; i.e. RX 1(θ)is a rotation along the x-axis of an angle θthat acts on the qubit 1.
•Each controlled Pauli X, the common CNOT gate is labelled as CX ij, where the first
subscript is the control qubit while the second is the target qubit.
The complete circuit is made by 14 circuits and 4 SWAPgates:
T0W1W2W4W5T12T17T15T18T20SWAP 0,1W3T21T7SWAP 1,2T19SWAP 2,1SWAP 1,0(F.1)
