Abstract
Then-qubit Pauli group and its normalizer the n-qubit Cliﬀord group have applications in
quantum error correction and device characterization. Recent a pplications have made use of the
representation theory of the Cliﬀord group. We apply the tools of ( the coincidentally named)
Cliﬀord theory to examine the representation theory of the Cliﬀord group using the much sim-
pler representation theory of the Pauli group. We ﬁnd an unexpec ted correspondence between
irreducible characters of the n-qubit Cliﬀord group and those of the ( n+1)-qubit Cliﬀord group.

1 Introduction
The Pauli group and its normalizer, the Cliﬀord group, are fun damental structures in quantum infor-
mation theory. These groups have applications in quantum er ror correction [Got09] and randomized
benchmarking [HWFW19]. By the Gottesman-Knill theorem, qu antum computation using Cliﬀord
unitaries is eﬃciently simulable on a classical computer [G ot98, AG04]. The Cliﬀord group is a unitary
2-design [DCEL09], in other words, ‘averages over the Cliﬀor d group approximate averages over the
unitary group well.’ Generating Haar random Cliﬀord unitari es is less computationally expensive than
sampling Haar random unitaries [KS14]. Thus random Cliﬀord e lements have utility in performing
randomized protocols. Recent applications of the Cliﬀord gr oup to randomized benchmarking and
classical shadow estimation have utilized its representat ion theory [HWFW19, HW22, HWW18]. De-
termining the character table of the Cliﬀord group, which cla ssiﬁes its irreducible representations,
is a natural open problem prompted by these papers. Surprisi ngly, despite the usefulness of the
representation theory of the Cliﬀord group, its character ta ble has not been determined.
The representation theory of the Pauli group is simple and ex plained in section 4. Thus it would
be advantageous to use our understanding of the representat ion theory of the Pauli group to examine
1

that of the Cliﬀord group. To do this, we can apply the tools of C liﬀord theory (which is named
after Alfred H. Cliﬀord, while William K. Cliﬀord gave his name to the group). Cliﬀord theory is
the subset of representation theory focused on relating rep resentations of a normal subgroup Nof
Gto representations of G. The inertia subgroup IG(σ) is the subgroup of Gthat maps σto an
isomorphic representation under conjugation. The central result of Cliﬀord theory is the Cliﬀord
correspondence between irreducible representations of the inertia subgro up and certain irreducible
representations of G. When the inertia subgroup is understood, this simpliﬁes th e calculation of
irreducible characters of G. Since any two nontrivial irreducible Pauli representatio ns are conjugate
in the Cliﬀord group and conjugate representations have isom orphic inertia subgroups, we need only
examine one inertia subgroup. In our ﬁrst result, we determi ne the inertia subgroup of a nontrivial
irreducible representation of the n-qubit Pauli group in the n-qubit Cliﬀord group up to complex
phases forn≥2.
Cliﬀord theory does not fully calculate the character table o f the Cliﬀord group. The Cliﬀord
correspondence does not give us any information when the ine rtia subgroup IG(σ) is all ofG. In
particular, the Cliﬀord correspondence does not help when σis the trivial representation of N. IfG
is a group, inﬂation produces a bijection between irreducib le representations of G/Nand irreducible
representations of Gwhose restriction to Nis trivial. We can thus understand the case where the
Cliﬀord correspondence oﬀers no information by examining the representation theory of the quotient
group. For the n-qubitCliﬀordgroupandthe n-qubitPauligroup, thequotient groupisthesymplectic
groupSp(2n,2). The symplectic group is a ﬁnite group of Lie type, and thus its representation
theory is calculated by the Deligne-Lusztig theory [GM20], which we do not examine in this paper.
Together with the representations calculated using Cliﬀord theory, this accounts for all the irreducible
representations of the Cliﬀord group.
Insection 4.1, we show that theinertia quotient group IG(σ)/Nof a nontrivial Pauli representation
in then-qubit Cliﬀord group is a central extension of the aﬃne symple ctic groupSp(2(n−1),2)⋉
Z2(n−1)
2byZ2. The Cliﬀord group, in the literature on ﬁnite group extensio ns, is the unique non-
split extension of Sp(2n,2) byZ2n
2. By examining the Cliﬀord group from this perspective, Bernd
Fischer showed in [Fis88] that the Cliﬀord and aﬃne symplecti c groups have identical character tables.
Combining these facts allows us to producea surprisingcorr espondence between irreducible characters
of then-qubit Cliﬀord group Cnand the (n+1)-qubit Cliﬀord group Cn+1. Any irreducible character
ofCncan be viewed as an irreducible character of Sp(2n,2)⋉ Z2n
2which inﬂates to an irreducible
character of INn+1which induces an irreducible character of Cn+1. The natural map of characters
fromCntoCn+1is induction. However, unlike induction of characters, our correspondence maps
irreducible characters to irreducible characters. Knowin g the irreducible characters of Cnallows us to
calculate an equal number of the irreducible characters of Cn+1.

2 Preliminaries
2.1 Representation theory
In this section, we recall from [Ser77] some basic facts abou t representation and character theory of
ﬁnite groups. A linear representation of a ﬁnite group Gis a homomorphism ρfrom the group G
into the group GL(V), whereVis a vector space over C. IfWis a vector subspace of Vsuch that
ρ(g)x∈Wfor allg∈Gandx∈W, then the restriction ρW(g) ofρ(g) toWis a linear representation
ofGonW. We callWasubrepresentation ofV. Anirreducible representation is one where Vis not
2

--- PAGE 3 ---
0 and no nontrivial vector subspace of VisG-stable. It is a standard result that every representation
is a direct sum of irreducible representations.
Ifρandσare representations of a ﬁnite group Gon the vector spaces VandWrespectively then
a linear map φ:V→Wis called an intertwining map of representations if φ(ρ(g)v) =σ(g)φ(v) for
allg∈Gand allv∈V. The vector space of all such G-linear maps between VandWis denoted by
HomG(ρ,σ) or Hom G(V,W). Ifφis also invertible, it is said to be an isomorphism of representations.
When we classify irreducible representations, we do so up to isomorphism. Isomorphic representations
are sometimes called equivalent representations.
LetFbe a ﬁeld, a projective representation of a ﬁnite group Gis a is a map Φ : G→GLn(F)
such that for every g,h∈G, there exists a scalar α(g,h)∈Fsuch that
Φ(g)Φ(h) = Φ(gh)α(g,h).
αis called the factor set . Note that it is uniquely determined by Φ. The notions of equi valence and
irreducibility translate verbatim for projective represe ntations. We refer the reader to section 7.2 of
[CSST22] for a more exhaustive discussion of projective rep resentations.
Letρ:G→GL(V) be a linear representation of a ﬁnite group G. For eachg∈G, deﬁne
χρ(g) = Tr(ρ(g)),
with Tr(ρ(g)) being the trace of the operator ρ(g)∈GL(V). The function χρonGis called the
character of the representation ρ. Ifρis irreducible, we call χρan irreducible character. It is a
standard result that two representations are isomorphic if and only if they have the same character.
Note that, from properties of the trace, χρ(h−1gh) =χρ(g) and thus characters are constant on the
conjugacy classes of groups. In other terms, characters are class functions .
Since characters form an orthonormal basis of the space of cl ass functions, the number of inequiv-
alent irreducible representations equals the number of con jugacy classes of G. Ifχis the character of
a representation ( ρ,V) ofG, ande∈Gis the identity, then χ(e) = dimVand is called the degreeof
the character. If Gis abelian, then every character is of degree 1.
Thecharacter table of a ﬁnite group Gis the table with rows corresponding to inequivalent irre-
ducible characters of Gand columns corresponding to conjugacy classes of G. Entry (i,j) of the table
is the value of the ithirreducible character of Gon thejthconjugacy class of G.
Cliﬀord theory deals with induced and restricted representa tions, which we will now deﬁne.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Ifρis a representation of GandHis a subgroup of Gthen we can deﬁne the
restriction ofρtoH
(ResG
Hρ)(h) :=ρ(h),for allh∈H.
The restriction is a representation of Hby deﬁnition. If χis the character of ρ, we can also deﬁne
the restriction of χtoHby
(ResG
Hχ)(h) :=χ(h),for allh∈H.
Notice that ResG
Hχis the character of ResG
Hρ.
Letρbe a representation of Gandψbe a subrepresentation of the restriction ResG
Hρofρto a
subgroupHofG. LetVandWbe the respective representation spaces of ρandψ. Fors∈Gthe
vector space ρ(s)Wdepends only on the left coset sHofs. Thus ifγis a left coset of Hwe can deﬁne
the subspace WγofVto beρ(s)Wfor anys∈γ. Clearly, the Wγare permuted by ρ(s) fors∈G.
This tells us that/summationtext
γ∈G/HWγis a subrepresentation of V.
Deﬁnition 2.2. We say that the representation ρofGisinduced by the representation ψofHon
WifVis equal to the direct sum of the Wσforσ∈G/H.
Restriction and induction of representations do not preser ve irreducibility in general. We state the
following theorem from [Ser77] without proof.
Theorem 2.3. Let(W,ψ)be a representation of H. There exists a linear representation of Ginduced
byψwhich we denote IndG
HψorIndG
HW. This induced representation is unique up to isomorphism.

2.2 Cliﬀord theory
The objective of Cliﬀord theory is to study the representatio n theory of a group via the representation
theory of its normal subgroups. Here we review the central re sults of Cliﬀord theory. In this section,
we largely follow the outline of Cliﬀord theory given in part 2 of [CSST09], and we refer the reader
there for proofs and a more thorough exposition. In addition , we collect some results from [CSST22],
which will prove essential to our analysis.
LetGbe a ﬁnite group and N/triangleleftequalGbe a normal subgroup of G. Let/hatwideGand/hatwideNdenote the set of all
irreducible representations of GandNrespectively up to equivalence. For two representations ρand
σwe writeσ/{ollowsequalρto denote that ρis a subrepresentation of σandρ∼σto denote that ρandσare
isomorphic representations.
Deﬁnition 2.4. Letσ∈/hatwideNandg∈G. We deﬁne
/hatwideG(σ) ={θ∈/hatwideG:ResG
N(θ)/{ollowsequalσ}.
Theg-conjugate ofσis the representationgσ∈/hatwideNdeﬁned by
gσ(n) =σ(g−1ng), (2.1)
for alln∈N. Theinertia subgroup ofσ∈/hatwideNis deﬁned
IG(σ) ={g∈G:gσ∼σ}.
Note thatgσis irreducible since any subspace invariant undergσis also invariant under σ. Since
ghσ(n) =σ((gh)−1n(gh)) =σ(h−1(g−1ng)h) =g(hσ(n)), equation 2.1 deﬁnes an action of Gon/hatwideN,
and thusIG(σ) is the stabilizer of σinG. Notice that
n1σ(n) =σ(n−1
1nn1) =σ(n1)−1σ(n)σ(n1) forn1,n∈N.
So ifχis the character of σandχn1is the character ofn1σwe have for n∈N
χn1(n) =tr(n1σ(n)) =tr(σ(n1)−1σ(n)σ(n1)) =tr(σ(n)) =χ(n).
Thus we haven1σ∼σforn1∈N, and therefore N≤IG(σ).
Lemma 2.5. Ifσandgσare conjugate representations of a normal subgroup Nof a ﬁnite group
G, andIG(σ)andIG(gσ)are the respective inertia subgroups, then IG(σ)andIG(gσ)are conjugate
subgroups of Gand in particular IG(σ)andIG(gσ)are isomorphic.
We can now recall from [CSST09] some central results of Cliﬀor d theory. Let Rbe a family of
coset representatives for the left IG(σ)-cosets inGwitheG∈R, that is
G=/unionsqdisplay
r∈RrIG(σ).
Then{gσ:g∈G}={rσ:r∈R}and the representationsrσare pairwise inequivalent.
Theorem 2.6 ([CSST09] Theorem 2.1) .Suppose that N/triangleleftequalGandσ∈/hatwideNandθ∈/hatwideG(σ). If we set
d= [IG(σ) :N]and letldenote the multiplicity of σinResG
Nθ, we have:
1.HomG(IndG
Nσ,IndG
Nσ)∼=Cdas vector spaces.
2.ResG
Nθ∼=l/circleplustext
r∈Rrσ.
The number l=dim(HomN(σ,ResG
Nθ)) is called the inertia index ofθ∈/hatwideG(σ) with respect to N.
4

--- PAGE 5 ---
Theorem 2.7 (Cliﬀord Correspondence) .LetN/triangleleftequalG,σ∈/hatwideNandI=IG(σ), then
/hatwideI(σ)→/hatwideG(σ) :ψ/ma√sto−→IndG
Iψ
is a bijection. The inertia index of ψ∈/hatwideI(σ)with respect to Ncoincides with the inertia index of IndG
Iψ
with respect to N. In turn, the inertia index of IndG
Iψwith respect to Nis equal to the multiplicity
mψofψinIndI
Nψ. Furthermore,
ResI
Nψ=mψσ.
Unfortunately, this correspondence does not tell us anythi ng in the case wherethe inertia subgroup
is all ofG. The study of what happens in this case is known as stable Cliﬀo rd theory and can be quite
complicated [Cra19]. Adapting a result from section 8.1 of [ Ser77] to our notation we can make the
following corollary.
Corollary 2.8. IfNis an abelian normal subgroup of G, the degree of each irreducible representation
ρofGdivides the index [G:N]ofNinG.
Deﬁnition 2.9. Letψbe a representation of G/N, theinﬂation /tildewideψofψis a representation of G
deﬁned by setting
/tildewideψ(g) =ψ(gN)for allg∈G.
Ifχand/tildewideχbe characters of ψand/tildewideψrespectively, then the map χ/ma√sto−→/tildewideχis a bijection between
the irreducible characters of G/Nand the irreducible characters of GwithNin their kernel (i.e.
/tildewideχ(n) = deg/tildewideχ). Note that deg (/tildewideχ) =deg(χ).
Letσbe an irreducible representation of Gandρ1be the trivial representation of N(the represen-
tation mapping every n∈Nto 1). If we suppose ResG
Nσ/{ollowsequalρ1then notice thathρ1(g) =ρ1(h−1gh) =
1 =ρ1(g) for allh,g∈G, thushρ1∼ρ1for allh∈H. Combining this observation with part 2of
theorem 2.6 we see
ResG
Nσ∼=deg(σ)/circleplusdisplay
l=1ρ1.
SoN≤ker(σ) and thusσis the inﬂation of an irreducible representation of G/N.
Deﬁnition 2.10. LetH≤G, and letσbe a representation of H. We call a representation σ′ofG
anextension ofσifResG
Hσ′=σ.
We can now state a consequence of the Cliﬀord correspondence t hat will prove very useful in our
study of the Cliﬀord group.
Theorem 2.11 (the little group method; [CSST09], Theorem 5.1) .LetGbe a ﬁnite group with N/triangleleftequalG
a normal subgroup. Suppose that any σ∈/hatwideNhas an extension σ′to its inertia group IG(σ). In/hatwideN
deﬁne an equivalence relation ≈by settingσ1≈σ2if there exists g∈Gsuch thatgσ1∼σ2. LetΣ
be a set of representatives for the equivalence classes of ≈. Forψ∈/hatwiderIG(σ)/Nlet/tildewideψbe its inﬂation to
IG(σ). Then
/hatwideG={IndG
IG(σ)(σ′⊗/tildewideψ) :σ∈Σ,ψ∈/hatwiderIG(σ)/N},
that is, the representations σ′⊗/tildewideψform a complete list of irreducible representations of Gand are
pairwise inequivalent.
Deﬁnition 2.12. LetQ,G, andNbe groups. If we have an injective homomorphism ι:N→G,
and a surjective homomorphism π:G→Q, and ifι(N) =ker(π), then we call Ganextension ofQ
byN. Ifι(N)is contained in the center of G, then we call Gacentral extension . A group extension
Gis often written as a short exact sequence
1→Nι− →Gπ− →Q→1.
5

--- PAGE 6 ---
Theorem 2.11 classiﬁes the irreducible representations of a group extension Gunder the constraint
that the irreducible representations σof the normal subgroup Ncan always be extended to represen-
tationsσ′of the corresponding inertia subgroup IG(σ).
Let 1→Bι− →Gπ− →H→1 be a central extension. When Gis a central extension and G/ne}ationslash∼=H×B,
the little group method does not apply. To examine this case w e require more specialized machinery.
Asectionof the extension is a map t:H→Gwhich is a right inverse for π, that is
π(t(h)) =h
for allh∈H. We call the section normalized ift(1H) = 1G. Forh,k∈Hwe have
π[t(h)t(k)] =π(t(h))π(t(k)) =hk=π(t(hk)),
so there exists a unique b(h,k)∈Bsuch that
t(h)t(k) =t(hk)ι[b(h,k)].
Let/hatwideHαdenote all the irreducible projective representations of a ﬁnite group Hwith factor set α. We
may now state a version of the little group method for central extensions.
Proposition 2.13 ([CSST22], Proposition 7.24) .For everyξ∈/hatwideBwe haveIG(ξ) =G. Let
η(h,k) =ξ(b(h,k)),
Let¯η(h,k) = (η(h,k))−1, then the map
/hatwideH¯η−→/hatwideG(ξ)
Φ/ma√sto−→Θ
is a bijection, with Θdeﬁned by
Θ(t(h)b) =ξ(b)Φ(h) (2.2)

3 The Pauli and Cliﬀord groups
3.1 Deﬁnitions
Here we recall the deﬁnitions of the Pauli and Cliﬀord groups a nd discuss the various deﬁnitions of
the Cliﬀord group in the literature.
Deﬁnition 3.1. LetU(d)be the set of d-by-d unitary matrices where d is some power of 2 . This has
a standard representation on the complex vector space Cd[FH91]. Let v0,v1be an orthonormal basis
ofC2and deﬁne the linear operators X,YandZby
Xvl=vl+1, Zvl= (−1)lvl, Yvl=−iZXvl= (−1)livl+1
forl∈ {0,1}, with addition over indices being modulo 2. These operators a re unitary. We deﬁne
then-qubit Pauli group Pnas the subset of the unitary group U(2n)consisting of all n-fold tensor
products of elements of P1:=/an}bracketle{tX,Z,iI 2/an}bracketri}ht, whereI2is the identity on C2.
P1is a group of order 16 with centre |Z(P1)|= 4. Since Pnconsists ofn-fold tensor products of
elements of P1it is a central product of P1, and thus |Pn|= 4n+1. The operators X,Y, andZcan
be written in matrix form with respect to the eigenbasis of Zas
X=/bracketleftbigg0 1
1 0/bracketrightbigg
Z=/bracketleftbigg1 0
0−1/bracketrightbigg
Y=/bracketleftbigg0−i
i0/bracketrightbigg
.
These are known as the Pauli matrices.
6

--- PAGE 7 ---
Deﬁnition 3.2. Then-qubit Cliﬀord group Cliﬀ( n)is the normalizer of the n-qubit Pauli group in
the unitary group
Cliﬀ(n) =/braceleftBig
U∈U(2n) :UPnU†⊆ Pn/bracerightBig
.
Since in quantum information theory global phases have no me asurable eﬀect, it is common to deﬁne
the Cliﬀord group mod phases. We denote this group
Cn=/braceleftBig
U∈U(2n) :UPnU†⊆ Pn/bracerightBig
/U(1),
and will call the n-qubit projective Cliﬀord group to diﬀerentiate it from other ways the Cliﬀord group
is deﬁned in the literature.
This is the version of the Cliﬀord group whose representation theory we would like to understand.
The Cliﬀord group Cliﬀ( n) is generated by the Hadamard ( H) and Phase ( S) gates on each qubit
(i.e. on each tensor factor), and Controlled-Z ( CZ) gate on each pair of qubits, along with phases. In
matrix form these gates are
H=1√
2/bracketleftbigg1 1
1−1/bracketrightbigg
S=/bracketleftbigg1 0
0i/bracketrightbigg
CZ=
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 −1
.
Operators that are n-fold tensor products only of 2-by-2 matrices are said to con sist only of single-
qubit operations. If an operator has 4-by-4 matrices in its d ecomposition, such as CZthat do not
decompose further into tensor factors, it is said to contain multi-qubit, or entangling, operations.
Multi-qubit Pauli operators either commute or anticommute . Notice that the group C4=/an}bracketle{tiIn/an}bracketri}htof
phases in Pnis the centre of Pn.
Deﬁnition 3.3. Deﬁne the n-qubit projective Pauli group to be/tildewidePn=Pn/C4. SinceC4contains the
commutator subgroup C2=/an}bracketle{t−In/an}bracketri}htofPn, we have that /tildewidePnis abelian.
Notice, /tildewidePnis a normal subgroup of Cn. Since /tildewidePn∼=Z2n
2we will often just write Z2n
2for the
projective Pauli group.
3.2 The symplectic structure of the Cliﬀord group
The quotient of the Cliﬀord group by the Pauli group and phases is essential to the stable Cliﬀord
theory of the Cliﬀord group. We will need the following propos ition, which we present without proof.
Proposition 3.4 (Prop 3.3 of [Sel15]) .Letφ:Pn→ Pnbe an automorphism of the Pauli group that
ﬁxes scalars. That is, φ(ilI2n) =ilIn2. Then there exists U∈Cliﬀ(n)unique up to phases such that
for allP∈ Pnwe haveUPU†=φ(P).
Remark 3.5. This says that Cn= Aut /angbracketlefti/angbracketright(Pn), that is, the Cliﬀord group consists of the automorphisms
of the Pauli group that ﬁx the centre.
Following arguments from [GNW17] and [dB12] we can show the f ollowing.
Theorem 3.6. The quotient of the Cliﬀord group Cliﬀ(n)by the Pauli group and phases is
Cn//tildewidePn∼=Sp(2n,2),
the symplectic group of degree 2noverZ2.
7

--- PAGE 8 ---
Proof.Forx= (p,q)∈Z2ndeﬁne the Weyl Operator
Wx=Wp,q=i−p·q(Zp1Xq1)⊗···⊗(ZpnXqn).
Clearly, all Weyl operators are elements of the Pauli group Pn, and any element of the Pauli group is
a Weyl operator up to a power of i. Weyl operators only depend on xmodulo 4, since
Wx+2z= (−1)[x,z]Wx, (3.1)
where we have introduced the Z-valued symplectic form [ ·,·] onZ2n
[x,z] = [(p,q),(p′,q′)] =p·q′−q·p′.
We will use this form when x,y∈Z2n
4, and interpret accordingly. For example, by direct computa tion
we have
WxWy=i[x,y]Wx+y.
Then for all x,y∈Z2n
4, we have
WxWy=i[x,y]Wx+y=i−[y,x]Wy+x=i−2[y,x]WyWx= (−1)[x,y]WyWx.
Thus the commutation relation depends on [ x,y] mod 2. By deﬁnition if U∈Cliﬀ(n) then for every
x∈Z2n
2,UWxU†is proportional to a Weyl operator Wx′by some power of iand by equation 3.1 we
can take x′∈Z2n
2. We deﬁne the function g:Z2n
2→Z4whereig(x)Wx′=UWxU†. Since conjugation
preserves commutation relations, we have
(−1)[x,y]Wy′Wx′=Wx′Wy′= (−1)[x′,y′]Wy′Wx′.
Thus the map Γ : x/ma√sto→x′preserves the symplectic form [ ·,·]. Furthermore,
ig(x+y)+[x,y]W(x+y)′=Ui[x,y]Wx+yU†=UWxWyU†
=UWxU†UWyU†=ig(x)+g(y)Wx′Wy′=i[x,y]+g(x)+g(y)Wx′+y′.
Thus
ig(x+y)W(x+y)′=ig(x)+g(y)Wx′+y′.
Then
W(x+y)′=±Wx′+y′.
So by equation 3.1, Γ is compatible with addition in Z2n
2. SinceZ2has only the scalars 0 and 1, we
deduce that Γ is linear and thus symplectic Γ ∈Sp(2n,2). Then for each U∈Cliﬀ(n) there is a
Γ∈Sp(2n,2) and a function g:Z2n
2→Z4such that
UWxU†=ig(x)WΓ(x).
Now notice that the n-qubit Pauli matrices form a basis of the vector space M2n(C) of all 2n-by-2n
matrices. If we specify the action of U∈Cliﬀ(n) on a generating set of the Pn, then we determine U
up to a phase since U′=eiθUhas the same action as Uby conjugation. From lemma 3.4 we have for
any automorphism φofPnthat ﬁxes scalars, that
φ(P) =UPU†
for allP∈ Pnand someU∈Cliﬀ(n).
For any linear Γ : Z2n
4→Z2n
4that preserves the symplectic product modulo 4, we can deﬁne the
map Φ : Pn→ Pnby
Φ(Wx) =WΓx,for allx∈Z2n
4.
8

--- PAGE 9 ---
To see this is well deﬁned, notice that WΓxis expressible as a linear combination of other Weyl
operators only if ±WΓy=WΓxfor some y∈Z2n
4. Then by dimension counting and equation 3.1 we
have Γy= Γ(x+ 2z) = Γx+ 2Γz. Thus the sign is given by ( −1)[Γx,Γz]= (−1)[x,z]. We see that
Wx=±Wywith the same sign so Φ is well deﬁned. Furthermore, since
Φ(Wx)Φ(Wy) =WΓxWΓy=i[x,y]WΓx+Γy=i[x,y]Φ(Wx+y) = Φ(WxWy),
extendingΦbylinearity deﬁnesanautomorphismon Pnthat ﬁxesscalars. Wethushavea U∈Cliﬀ(n)
such that
UWxU†=WΓx.

j=1be a basis of Z2n
2. For any Γ ∈Sp(2n,2), let
Γej=vjfor allj∈ {1,...,2n}.
In other words let C= [v1···v2n] be the matrix corresponding to the symplectic map Γ. Deﬁne
v1:=v1. For each subsequent j >1 we deﬁne vj:=vj+2xjwithxj∈Z2n
2. Notice that for all jwe
havevj∈Z2n
4. We choose the xjsuch that
[vj,vj] = 0 mod 4 and [ vh,vj] =δh,n+j−δj,n+hmod 4 forh<j,
whereδa,bis the Kronecker delta. Since Γ preserves the symplectic pro duct mod 2 (and thus preserves
commutators and anticommutators), we have both of these res trictions already satisﬁed mod 2. The
matrixC= [v1···v2n] is symplectic modulo 4 and C=Cmod 2. This means that for each Γ ∈
Sp(2n,2) there is a /tildewideΓ∈Sp(Z2n
4) such that Γ x=/tildewideΓxmod 2 thus we obtain /tildewideΓx−Γx= 2zfor some
z∈Z2n. If we deﬁne the function f:Z2n
2→Z2byf(x) = [Γx,z] mod 2, we have
(−1)f(x)WΓx=WΓx+2z=W/tildewideΓx.
This implies that for every Γ ∈Sp(2n,2) there exists a U∈Cliﬀ(n) and a function f:Z2n
2→Z2such
that for all x∈Z2n
2
UWxU†= (−1)f(x)WΓx. (3.2)
ThisUis determined uniquely up to phase since we have determined i ts action by conjugation. Thus
we have a surjective correspondence U/ma√sto→Γ between CnandSp(2n,2), and we see that the quotient
of Cliﬀ(n) by Paulis and phases is Sp(2n,2).
Note that this implies that Cnis an extension of Sp(2n,2) byZ2n
2, but since we cannot specify
thatf≡0 for all choices of U∈Cliﬀ(n) in equation 3.2 the extension does not split for n>1. For
n= 1 we have C1∼=S4∼=Sp(2,2)⋉Z2
2. Since|Sp(2n,2)|= 2n2/producttextn
j=1(22j−1), we obtain the following
immediate corollary.
Corollary 3.7. The order of the Cliﬀord group is
|Cn|=|/tildewidePn||Sp(2n,2)|= 2n2+2nn/productdisplay
j=1(22j−1).
3.3 The character table of the projective Pauli group
Since then-qubit projective Pauli group is abelian it has only degree o ne irreducible characters.
One-dimensional representations characters coincide sin ce the trace leaves 1-by-1 matrices invariant.
Elements of the n-qubit projective Pauli grouphave order at most 2. Thus, the character of an element
of/tildewidePnmust be ±1./tildewidePnis generated by {[X1],[Z1],...,[Xn],[Zn]}, where [Aj] is the equivalence class
of the Pauli operator Aacting on the jthqubit
Aj=I⊗j−1
2⊗A⊗I⊗n−j
2.

--- PAGE 10 ---
So a character of /tildewidePnis fully determined by a choice of ±1 for [Xi] and [Zi] for eachi∈ {1,...,n}. The
4 choices for each qubit leave us with 4nchoices for the whole group. There are 4n=|/tildewidePn|characters
since/tildewidePnis abelian and thus has only singleton conjugacy classes. Ir reducible characters that disagree
on any one element must be distinct, so this completely deter mines the character table of /tildewidePn. Thus,
the character table of /tildewidePncan be written by ﬁlling the ﬁrst row and column of a 4n-by-4ntable with
ones, then in the rest of each remaining row writing each perm utation of4n
2−1 ones and4n
2negative
ones.
4 The inertia subgroup
To begin our study of the character theory of the n-qubit Cliﬀord quotient group, we examine the
inertia subgroups of the representations of the n-qubit projective Pauli group in the n-qubit projective
Cliﬀord group.
Lemma 4.1. Letσandρbe nontrivial irreducible representations of /tildewidePn, then there exists g∈ Cnsuch
thatgσ∼ρ. In other words, all nontrivial irreducible representation s of/tildewidePnare conjugate in Cn.
Proof.We begin the proof by noticing that
HXH−1=Z
HZH−1=X
HYH−1=−Y.(4.1)
So we have that conjugation of Pauli matrices by HmapsXtoZ, and vice versa, while mapping Y
to−Y. Thus conjugation by [ H] maps [X] to [Z] and vice versa while leaving [ Y] invariant. We can
calculate
SXS−1=Y
SZS−1=Z
SYS−1=−X,(4.2)
thus conjugation by [ S] maps [X] to [Y] and vice versa while leaving [ Z] invariant. Furthermore
conjugation by [ H][S][H] maps [Z] to [Y] and vice versa while leaving [ X] invariant. We see that
we can permute the equivalence classes of the non-identity o ne-qubit Pauli matrices in any way via
conjugation by elements of Cn.
We now turn our attention to 2-qubit operators. Consider the swap gate, if AandBare any
2-by-2 matrices we have
(SWAP)(A⊗B)(SWAP) =B⊗A.
Our previous calculations for 1-qubit matrices tell us that any pair of nontrivial representations σand
ρof/tildewidePnthat have the same number of pairs of generators ([ Xi],[Zi]) in their kernels, that is
|{i∈ {1,...,n}:ρ([Xi]) =ρ([Zi]) = 1}|=|{i∈ {1,...,n}:σ([Xi]) =σ([Zi]) =−1}|,
are conjugate in Cn. Suppose that we have two representations ρandσof/tildewideP2with
σ([X⊗I]) =σ([I⊗Z]) =−1
σ([Z⊗I]) =σ([I⊗X]) = 1
ρ([X⊗I]) =ρ([I⊗X]) =ρ([Z⊗I]) = 1
ρ([I⊗Z]) =−1.
10

--- PAGE 11 ---
Recall that this completely determines σandρ. Now we calculate
CZ(I⊗X)CZ= (Z⊗X)
CZ(Z⊗I)CZ= (Z⊗I)
CZ(X⊗I)CZ= (X⊗Z)
CZ(I⊗Z)CZ= (I⊗Z).
Thus we have
CZρ([X⊗I]) =ρ([X⊗Z]) =−1 =σ([X⊗I])
CZρ([Z⊗I]) =ρ([Z⊗I]) = 1 =σ([Z⊗I])
CZρ([I⊗X]) =ρ([Z⊗X]) = 1 =σ([I⊗X])
CZρ([I⊗Z]) =ρ([I⊗Z]) =−1 =σ([I⊗Z]).
Thus nontrivial irreducible representations σandρof/tildewideP2with diﬀering numbers of ([ Xi],[Yi]) pairs
in their kernels, that is
|{i∈ {1,2}:ρ([Xi]) =ρ([Zi]) = 1}| /ne}ationslash=|{i∈ {1,2}:σ([Xi]) =σ([Zi]) = 1}|,
are conjugate in C2. Since restricting irreducible representations of /tildewidePnto any two qubits gives an irre-
ducible representation of /tildewideP2, taking all the previous calculations together, we have tha t all nontrivial
irreducible representations of /tildewidePnare conjugate in Cn.
Since by lemma 2.5 conjugate representations of normal subg roups have isomorphic inertia sub-
groups, we see that there is only one inertia subgroup to calc ulate for the nontrivial representations
of the projective Pauli group in the Cliﬀord group. We have the following immediate corollary.
Corollary 4.2. Ifρis an irreducible representation of Cnandσan irreducible representation of /tildewidePn
withResCn
/tildewidePnρ/{ollowsequalσthen one of two cases hold:
1.σis trivial, in which case /tildewidePnis in the kernel of ρ. In this case, ρis the inﬂation of an irreducible
representation of Sp(2n,2).
2.σis nontrivial in which case we can apply Lemma 4.1 and Theorem 2 .6 to obtain
ResCn
/tildewidePnρ=l/circleplusdisplay
θ∈Irr(/tildewidePn)
θnontrivialθ, (4.3)
where Irr (/tildewidePn)is the set of irreducible representations of /tildewidePnandlis the inertia index of ρwith
respect to /tildewidePn.
Additionally, since /tildewidePnis an abelian normal subgroup of Cnwe have that the degree of ρdivides
[Cn:/tildewidePn] = 2n2n/productdisplay
j=1(22j−1)
by Corollary 2.8.
If we specialize to case 2, then equation 4.3 and the fact that all irreducible representations of /tildewidePn
have degree 1 implies that the degree of ρis divisible by 4n−1 (the number of nontrivial irreducible
representations of /tildewidePn). Ifχis the character of ρ, then equation 4.3 implies
ResCn
/tildewidePnχ=l/summationdisplay
ψ∈IrrChar( /tildewidePn)
ψnontrivialψ,
11

--- PAGE 12 ---
where IrrChar( /tildewidePn) is the set of irreducible characters of /tildewidePn. In particular if g∈/tildewidePnis a non-identity
element then χ(g) =−l, since for any such gthe summand takes the value −1 a total of 22(n−1)+1
times and takes the value 1 a total of 22(n−1)+1−1 times.
Tounderstandcase2, weneedtocalculate theinertiasubgro upICn(σ)ofanontrivialrepresentation
σof thePauli group in the Cliﬀord group. Let M=CX1,2(Z1H1X2)CX1,2Thenwe have the following
theorem.
Theorem 4.3. Forn≥2the inertia subgroup of a nontrivial representation of /tildewidePninCnis isomorphic
toINn:=/an}bracketle{t{[M],[H1],[X1],[I⊗A] :forA∈Cliﬀ(n−1)}/an}bracketri}ht.
Proof.Notice that if σis a nontrivial irreducible representation of /tildewidePn, andψan irreducible represen-
tation ofI=ICn(σ) with ResI
/tildewidePnψ/{ollowsequalσthen by the Cliﬀord correspondence we have
mψ(22n−1) = degmψ/circleplusdisplay
θ∈Irr(/tildewidePn)
θnontrivialθ= deg IndCn
Iψ= [Cn:I]degψ,
wheremψis the inertia index of ψwith respect to /tildewidePn. Additionally, by the Cliﬀord correspondence,
[Cn:I]degψ= [Cn:I]mψdegσ=mψ[Cn:I],
Thus [Cn:I] = 22n−1 and
|I|=1
22n−1|Cn|= 2n2+2nn−1/productdisplay
j=1(22j−1) = 22n+1|Cn−1|.
So if for any particular σwe can ﬁnd a subgroup of Cnthat preserves σunder conjugation and has
this order, then we have found the inertia subgroup.
Consider the irreducible character σ1of/tildewidePndeﬁned by σ1([X1]) =σ1([Z1]) =−1 andσ1([Xi]) =
σ1([Zi]) = 1 for all i∈ {2,...,n}. We want to calculate ICn(σ1) ={g∈ Cn:gσ1∼σ1}. So we
want to ﬁnd the elements of Cnthat preserve the presence of XorZin the ﬁrst tensor factor by
conjugation. We immediately see that [ I⊗A]∈ICn(σ1) forA∈Cliﬀ(n) since operations restricted to
other qubits do not aﬀect the ﬁrst qubit. Since conjugation by Hsimply exchanges XandZ, we also
have [H1]∈ICn(σ1). Additionally, we have the operator
CX(ZH⊗X)CX=1√
2
0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1
−1 0 0 1
0−1 1 0
.
The action of this matrix on P2by conjugation is
CX(ZH⊗X)CX(X⊗I)CX(HZ⊗X)CX=−Z⊗X
CX(ZH⊗X)CX(Z⊗I)CX(HZ⊗X)CX=X⊗X
CX(ZH⊗X)CX(I⊗X)CX(HZ⊗X)CX=I⊗X
CX(ZH⊗X)CX(I⊗Z)CX(HZ⊗X)CX=−ZX⊗ZX.
Then we have σ1([ZX⊗ZX]) =σ1([Z⊗Z])σ1([X⊗X]) = (−1)2=σ1([I⊗Z]). Thus the action
of [CX(ZH⊗X)CX] preserves σ1. The action of INnleaves [X1Z1] invariant, thus there are 22n−1
possible images of the pair ([ X1],[Z1]). The order of INnis thus
(22n−1)(22n)|Sp(2(n−1),2)|= 22n+1|Cn−1|.

Notethatthereisnowaytowrite[ X1]intermsoftheothergenerators of INn. Since[X1]−1= [X1],
any reduction we perform on a word written in these generator s preserves the parity of the number of
[X1]s. Forga word inINn, letnX1(g) be the number of times X1appears in g. The above analysis
implies that the map
σ′
1:INn−→ {1,−1}
g/ma√sto−→(−1)nX1(g)
is an irreducible character of INn, and clearly ResINn
Pnσ′
1=σ1. Thusσ′
1is an extension of σ1toINn,
its own inertia group. Since all nontrivial irreducible rep resentations of the projective Pauli group
Z2n
2are conjugate, we have that any irreducible representation σof the projective Pauli group can be
extended to a representation σ′of its own inertia group I(σ) in the Cliﬀord group. We apply the little
group method to obtain the following.
Theorem 4.4. The irreducible representations of the projective Cliﬀord gr oup are

,
where the /tildewideψin the left set is an inﬂation to an irreducible representati on ofINnand in the right set
is an inﬂation to an irreducible representation of Cn.
Theorem 4.4 gives a complete list of the irreducible represe ntations of the n-qubit Cliﬀord group.
To actually calculate these representations, we would like to know the representations of Sp(2n,2)
and those of the quotient group INn/Pn. Using theorem 4.4, we may calculate the following example
character tables.
Example 4.5. The character table of the 1-qubit projective Pauli group is
[I2] [X] [Z] [Y]
ψ11 1 1 1
ψ21 -1 1 -1
ψ31 1 -1 -1
ψ41 -1 -1 1.
Notice that the inertia group of the representation ψ4is just the subgroup I(ψ4) =/an}bracketle{t[H],[X],[Z]/an}bracketri}ht ⊂ C1.
The extension ψ′
4ofψ4toI(ψ4)is achieved by deﬁning the value of ψ′
4([H]) = 1. The character table
ofI(ψ4)/Z2
2is
[[I2]] [[H]]
φ11 1
φ21 -1.
Via GAP4 calculation, the character table of Sp(2,2)is
[[I2]] [[H]] [[S]]
θ11 1 1
θ21 -1 1
θ32 0 -1.
Then by theorem 4.4 the character table of the 1-qubit Cliﬀord g roupC1is

4.1 The representation theory of the inertia quotient group
To understand the irreducible representations of the Cliﬀor d group with nontrivial restriction to the
Pauli group, we will now examine the irreducible representa tions ofINn/Z2n
2. Notice that
HM
1= (XZ⊗X)H1,
and thatH1commutes with all other non-Pauli operators in the generati ng set ofINn. From this we
see that Z2∼=/an}bracketle{t[[I]],[[H1]]/an}bracketri}htforms an order 2 normal subgroup of INn/Z2n
2. For convenience we make
the deﬁnition H1,n:=/an}bracketle{t[H1],{[Xi],[Zi],fori= 1,...,n}/an}bracketri}ht. We are ready to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 4.6. The inertia quotient group has the aﬃne symplectic group as a q uotient group, that is
(INn/Z2n
2)/Z2∼=INn/H1,n∼=Sp(2(n−1),2)⋉Z2(n−1)
2.
Proof.Forx∈Z2(n−1)
2, letWxbe the Weyl operator deﬁned in the proof of theorem 3.6. Consi der
operators of the form X⊗WxandZ⊗Wx, which we will call inertia Weyl operators since by deﬁnitio n
n-qubit Weyl operators of this form are preserved by the inert ia subgroup INnunder conjugation.
Since then-qubit Pauli group is generated by these inertia Weyl operat ors, the action of U∈INnby
conjugation on these operators deﬁnes the action of Uon the Pauli group.
From theorem 3.6, we know that conjugating an inertia Weyl op erator byI⊗UforU∈Cliﬀ(n−1)
will give us X⊗WΓxorZ⊗WΓxrespectively for some Γ ∈Sp(2(n−1),2) with potential phase factors.
Furthermore, we know that any such Γ is realized by some U∈Cliﬀ(n−1). Conjugation by H1will
exchange the XandZon the ﬁrst qubit. Conjugating by MS2H2S−1
2amounts to multiplication by
X2on the left with a possible phase factor of −1 and a possible exchange of XandZon the ﬁrst
qubit. Similarly conjugation by H1H2MS2H2S−1
2H2amounts to multiplication by Z2on the left with
a possible phase factor of −1 and a possible exchange of XforZ.
Notice that the actions by conjugation of the matrices we hav e examined generate the aﬃne
symplectic group Sp(2(n−1),2)⋉ Z2(n−1)
2on the index xof a Weyl operator Wx, with an extra
operatorHthat exchanges the XandZon the ﬁrst qubit. Since the equivalence classes of said
matrices also generate INn, and the inertia Weyl operators along with H1generate H1,n, we have the
result.
From the proof of this lemma, we see that the quotient group INn/Z2n
2is a central extension of
Sp(2(n−1),2)⋉Z2(n−1)
2byZ2. Through GAP4 calculation we have determined that in genera l, the
extension will not be a direct product, although it is in the c ase of two qubits. Fix a normalized
sectiontof the central extension INn/Z2n
2ofSp(2(n−1),2)⋉Z2(n−1)
2byZ2. Letb(h,k)∈Z2be the
corresponding factor set. The only nontrivial irreducible representation ξofZ2maps the non-identity
element to −1. Letη(h,k) =ξ(b(h,k)). By applying proposition 2.13, we obtain
/hatwiderINn/Z2n
2=/braceleftbigg
/tildewideψ:ψ∈/hatwiderSp(2(n−1),2)⋉Z2(n−1)
2/bracerightbigg
∪/braceleftbigg
Θ : Ψ∈(/hatwiderSp(2(n−1),2)⋉Z2(n−1)
2)η/bracerightbigg
,
with Θ deﬁned by Θ( t(h)b) =ξ(b)Ψ(h) for allh∈Sp(2(n−1),2)⋉Z2(n−1)
2andb∈Z2.
5 Lifting irreduciblecharacters to higher dimensional Cli ﬀord groups
We will now explain how irreducible characters of the n-qubit Cliﬀord group can be used to explicitly
construct characters of the ( n+1)-qubit Cliﬀord group.
First, we need to understand the representation theory of th e aﬃne symplectic group Sp(2n,2)⋉
Z2n
2. It is clear that if Uacts onZ2n
2by Γ∈Sp(2n,2) then(x,Γ)σ∼Uσfor anyσ∈/hatwidestZ2n
2and
(x,Γ)∈Sp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2. Letσ1be the irreducible representation of Z2n
2deﬁned in section 5, then it
follows that ISp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2(σ1)/Z2n
2∼=INn/Z2n
2Letσ′′
1be the extension of σ1toISp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2(σ1) via
σ′′
1(x,Γ) =σ1(x). Applying theorem 2.11 we immediately obtain the followin g.

where/tildewideψin the left set is the inﬂation to (INn/Z2n
2)⋉Z2n
2and in the right set is inﬂation to Sp(2n,2)⋉
Z2n
2.
We can nowprove thefollowing lemma whichwas ﬁrstproven byB ernd Fischer usingthetechnique
of Fischer-Cliﬀord matrices in [Fis88].
Lemma 5.2. Sp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2andCnhave identical character tables.
Proof.This is trivially true if n= 1, as in that case, the groups are isomorphic. For n >1 we ﬁrst
notice that
(Sp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2)/Z2n
2∼=Sp(2n,2)∼=Cn//tildewiderPn.
The irreducible characters that come from Sp(2n,2) are nothing but inﬂations of the irreducible
characters of Sp(2n,2). Thus if χis an irreducible character of Sp(2n,2) and/tildewideχand/tildewideχ′are its inﬂations
toCnandSp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2respectively, we have
/tildewideχ(U) =χ(Γ) =/tildewideχ′(x,Γ) (5.1)
for allx∈Z2n
2andU∈ Cnsuch thatUWxU†= (−1)f(x)WΓx.
Fix a normalized section t:Sp(2n,2)→ Cnof the extension
1→Z2n
2→ Cn→Sp(2n,2)→1
such thatσ1(t(Γ)) = 1. Deﬁne mapping φ:Sp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2→ Cnbyφ(x,Γ) =Wxt(Γ). It is clear
that this mapping is one-to-one and onto, and σ′′
1(s) =σ′
1(φ(s)) for alls∈Sp(2n,2)⋉ Z2n
2. Using
the notation of equation 5.1 we see that /tildewideχ(φ(s)) =/tildewideχ′(s) for alls∈Sp(2n,2)⋉ Z2n
2. Letψbe an
irreducible representation of INn/Z2n
2, and/tildewideψand/tildewideψ′be its inﬂations to ICn(σ1) andISp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2(σ1)
respectively. From the formula for induced characters, we h ave
IndSp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2
ISp(2n,2)⋉Z2n

1)(s) =1

r∈Cn
r−1sr∈ICn(σ1)/tildewideψ⊗σ′

Since the action by conjugation of φ(x,Γ) depends only on Γ, we see that φ(r)−1φ(s)φ(r)∈ICn(σ1)if
andonlyifr−1sr∈ISp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2(σ1)foranyr,s∈Sp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2, andfurthermore /tildewideψ(φ(r)−1φ(s)φ(r)) =
/tildewideψ′(r−1sr). Finally, we obtain
IndCn
ICn(σ1)(/tildewideψ⊗σ′
1)(φ(s)) = IndSp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2
ISp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2(σ1)(/tildewideψ′⊗σ′′
1)(s)
for alls∈Sp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2. By column orthogonality of character tables we have that r,s∈Sp(2n,2)⋉
Z2n
2are conjugate if and only if φ(r) andφ(t) are conjugate in Cn. Thus the map φrespects conjugacy
classes and the character tables are identical.
Taken together these lemmas imply a remarkable property of t he Cliﬀord group.

Theorem 5.3. Letφ:Sp(2n,2)⋉ Z2n
2→ Cnbe the map deﬁned in the proof of lemma 5.2. If χis
an irreducible character of the n-qubit Cliﬀord group CnthenIndCn+1
INn+1/tildewider(χ◦φ)⊗σ′
1is an irreducible
character of the (n+1)-qubit Cliﬀord group Cn+1.
Proof.By lemma 5.2 we see that every irreducible character χofCnis also an irreducible character
ofSp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2when precomposed with the bijection φof the conjugacy classes of the two groups.
We can then see by lemma 4.6 that the irreducible character χφ:=χ◦φofSp(2n,2)⋉Z2n
2inﬂates
to an irreducible character /tildewiderχφofINn+1that contains H1,n+1in its kernel. In Particular this means
that/tildewidePn+1will be contained in the kernel of /tildewiderχφ, so we know that /tildewiderχφ⊗σ′
1is an irreducible character
ofINn+1that hasσ1in the decomposition of its restriction to /tildewidePn+1into irreducible representations.
Therefore, by the Cliﬀord correspondence we obtain the resul t.
Thisgives astraightforwardmethodforobtainingirreduci blecharacters ofthe( n+1)-qubitCliﬀord
group from irreducible characters of the n-qubit Cliﬀord group.
Example 5.4. As an example, we demonstrate the lifting procedure from the 1-qubit to the 2-qubit
Cliﬀord group. In this case, because of the isomorphism C1∼=Sp(2,2)⋉Z2
2, we know that the inertia
quotientIN2/Z4
2group is a central extension of C1byZ2. Moreover, in this case, the extension splits
and we have IN2/Z2
2∼=C1×Z2. If we denote the characters of C1byχifori∈ {1,...5}and denote
the characters of Z2byθ1andθ2whereθ1is the trivial representation. The character table of C1×Z2
is
([I2],0) ([ I2],1)
µ1:=χ1×θ11 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
µ2:=χ2×θ11 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 1
µ3:=χ1×θ21 1 1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 -1
µ4:=χ2×θ21 1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
µ5:=χ3×θ12 2 -1 0 0 0 0 -1 2 2
µ6:=χ3×θ22 2 -1 0 0 0 0 1 -2 -2
µ7:=χ4×θ13 -1 0 -1 1 -1 1 0 3 -1
µ8:=χ4×θ23 -1 0 -1 1 1 -1 0 -3 1
µ9:=χ5×θ23 -1 0 1 -1 -1 1 0 -3 1

So from every character of C1we will get two characters of C2, and the character table of C2is
determined entirely by these characters, and inﬂated chara cters from Sp(4,2). Thus the character
table ofC2is
