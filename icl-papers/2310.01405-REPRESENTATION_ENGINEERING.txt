ABSTRACT
We identify and characterize the emerging area of representation engineering
(RepE), an approach to enhancing the transparency of AI systems that draws on
insights from cognitive neuroscience. RepE places representations, rather than neu-
rons or circuits, at the center of analysis, equipping us with novel methods for mon-
itoring and manipulating high-level cognitive phenomena in deep neural networks
(DNNs). We provide baselines and an initial analysis of RepE techniques, showing
that they offer simple yet effective solutions for improving our understanding and
control of large language models. We showcase how these methods can provide trac-
tion on a wide range of safety-relevant problems, including honesty, harmlessness,
power-seeking, and more, demonstrating the promise of top-down transparency
research. We hope that this work catalyzes further exploration of RepE and fosters
advancements in the transparency and safety of AI systems. Code is available at

Figure 2: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) vs. Representation Engineering (RepE). This figure draws
from (Barack & Krakauer, 2021; Wang et al., 2023a). Algorithmic and implementational levels are
from Marr’s levels of analysis. Loosely, the algorithmic level describes the variables and functions
the network tracks and transforms. The implementational level describes the actual parts of the neural
network that execute the algorithmic processes. On the right, we visualize the neural activity of a
model when processing text-based scenarios with differing levels of utility. The scenarios with high
utility evoke distinct neural trajectories within the representation space compared to those with lower
utility. ‘PC’ denotes a principal component.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Deep neural networks have achieved incredible success across a wide variety of domains, yet
their inner workings remain poorly understood. This problem has become increasingly urgent
over the past few years due to the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs). Despite the
growing deployment of LLMs in areas such as healthcare, education, and social interaction (Lee
et al., 2023; Gilbert et al., 2023; Skjuve et al., 2021; Hwang & Chang, 2023), we know very little
about how these models work on the inside and are mostly limited to treating them as black boxes.
Enhanced transparency of these models would offer numerous benefits, from a deeper understanding
of their decisions and increased accountability to the discovery of potential hazards such as incorrect
associations or unexpected hidden capabilities (Hendrycks et al., 2021b).
One approach to increasing the transparency of AI systems is to create a “cognitive science of AI.”
Current efforts toward this goal largely center around the area of mechanistic interpretability, which
focuses on understanding neural networks in terms of neurons and circuits. This aligns with the
Sherringtonian view in cognitive neuroscience, which sees cognition as the outcome of node-to-node
connections, implemented by neurons embedded in circuits within the brain. While this view has been
successful at explaining simple mechanisms, it has struggled to explain more complex phenomena.
The contrasting Hopfieldian view ( n.b., not to be confused with Hopfield networks) has shown more
promise in scaling to higher-level cognition. Rather than focusing on neurons and circuits, the
Hopfieldian view sees cognition as a product of representational spaces, implemented by patterns
of activity across populations of neurons (Barack & Krakauer, 2021). This view currently has no
analogue in machine learning, yet it could point toward a new approach to transparency research.
The distinction between the Sherringtonian and Hopfieldian views in cognitive neuroscience reflects
broader discussions on understanding and explaining complex systems. In the essay “More Is
Different,” Nobel Laureate P. W. Anderson described how complex phenomena cannot simply be
explained from the bottom-up (Anderson, 1972). Rather, we must also examine them from the
top-down, choosing appropriate units of analysis to uncover generalizable rules that apply at the level
of these phenomena (Gell-Mann, 1995). Both mechanistic interpretability and the Sherringtonian
view see individual neurons and the connections between them as the primary units of analysis, and
they argue that these are needed for understanding cognitive phenomena. By contrast, the Hopfieldian
view sees representations as the primary unit of analysis and seeks to study them on their own terms,

abstracting away low-level details. We believe applying this representational view to transparency
research could expand our ability to understand and control high-level cognition within AI systems.
In this work, we identify and characterize the emerging area of representation engineering (RepE),
which follows an approach of top-down transparency to better understand and control the inner
workings of neural networks. Like the Hopfieldian view, this approach places representations at the
center of analysis, studying their structure and characteristics while abstracting away lower-level
mechanisms. We think pursuing this top-down approach to transparency is important, and our work
serves as an early step in exploring its potential. Compared to approaches that apply activation vectors
to frozen models under the umbrella of activation engineering (Turner et al., 2023e), we aim to uncover
insights from both reading and control experiments and introduce representation tuning methods.
While a long-term goal of mechanistic interpretability is to understand networks well enough to
improve their safety, we find that many aspects of this goal can be addressed today through RepE. In
particular, we develop improved baselines for reading and controlling representations and demonstrate
that these RepE techniques can provide traction on a wide variety of safety-relevant problems,
including truthfulness, honesty, hallucination, utility estimation, knowledge editing, jailbreaking,
memorization, tracking emotional states, and avoiding power-seeking tendencies.
In addition to demonstrating the broad potential of RepE, we also find that advances to RepE methods
can lead to significant gains in specific areas, such as honesty. By increasing model honesty in a fully
unsupervised manner, we achieve state-of-the-art results on TruthfulQA, improving over zero-shot
accuracy by 18.1percentage points and outperforming all prior methods. We also show how RepE
techniques can be used across diverse scenarios to detect and control whether a model is lying. We
hope that this work will accelerate progress in AI transparency by demonstrating the potential of a
representational view. As AI systems become increasingly capable and complex, achieving better
transparency will be crucial for enhancing their safety, trustworthiness, and accountability, enabling
these technologies to benefit society while minimizing the associated risks.
2 R ELATED WORK
2.1 E MERGENT STRUCTURE IN REPRESENTATIONS
While neural networks internals are often considered chaotic and uninterpretable, research has
demonstrated that they can acquire emergent, semantically meaningful internal structure. Early
research on word embeddings discovered semantic associations and compositionality (Mikolov et al.,
2013), including reflections of gender biases in text corpora (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Later work
6

--- PAGE 7 ---
showed that learned text embeddings also cluster along dimensions reflecting commonsense morality,
even though models were not explicitly taught this concept (Schramowski et al., 2019). Radford et al.
(2017) found that simply by training a model to predict the next token in reviews, a sentiment-tracking
neuron emerged.
Observations of emergent internal representations are not limited to text models. McGrath et al.
(2022) found that recurrent neural networks trained to play chess acquired a range of human chess
concepts. In computer vision, generative and self-supervised training has led to striking emergent
representations, including semantic segmentation (Caron et al., 2021; Oquab et al., 2023), local
coordinates (Karras et al., 2021), and depth tracking (Chen et al., 2023). These findings suggest
that neural representations are becoming more well-structured, opening up new opportunities for
transparency research. Our paper builds on this long line of work by demonstrating that many
safety-relevant concepts and processes appear to emerge in LLM representations, enabling us to
directly monitor and control these aspects of model cognition via representation engineering.
2.2 A PPROACHES TO INTERPRETABILITY
Saliency Maps. A popular approach to explaining neural network decisions is via saliency maps,
which highlight regions of the input that a network attends to (Simonyan et al., 2013; Springenberg
et al., 2014; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Zhou et al., 2016; Smilkov et al., 2017; Sundararajan et al.,
2017; Selvaraju et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2019b). However, the reliability of these
methods has been drawn into question (Adebayo et al., 2018; Kindermans et al., 2019; Jain & Wallace,
2019; Bilodeau et al., 2022). Moreover, while highlighting regions of attention can provide some
understanding of network behavior, it provides limited insight into the internal representations of
networks.
Feature Visualization. Feature visualization interprets network internals by creating representative
inputs that highly activate a particular neuron. A simple method is to find highly-activating natural
inputs (Szegedy et al., 2013; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014). More complex methods optimize inputs to
maximize activations (Erhan et al., 2009; Mordvintsev et al., 2015; Yosinski et al., 2015; Nguyen
et al., 2016; 2019). These methods can lead to meaningful insights, but do not take into account the
distributed nature of neural representations (Hinton, 1984; Szegedy et al., 2013; Fong & Vedaldi,
2018; Elhage et al., 2022).
Mechanistic Interpretability. Inspired by reverse-engineering tools for traditional software, mech-
anistic interpretability seeks to fully reverse engineer neural networks into their “source code.” This
approach focuses on explaining neural networks in terms of circuits, composed of node-to-node
connections between individual neurons or features. Specific circuits have been identified for various
capabilities, including equivariance in visual recognition (Olah et al., 2020), in-context learning
(Olsson et al., 2022), indirect object identification (Wang et al., 2023a), and mapping answer text to
answer labels (Lieberum et al., 2023).
Considerable manual effort is required to identify circuits, which currently limits this approach.
Moreover, it is unlikely that neural networks can be fully explained in terms of circuits, even in
principle. There is strong evidence that ResNets compute representations through iterative refinement
(Liao & Poggio, 2016; Greff et al., 2016; Jastrzebski et al., 2018). In particular, Veit et al. (2016)
find that ResNets are surprisingly robust to lesion studies that remove entire layers. Recent work has
demonstrated similar properties in LLMs (McGrath et al., 2023; Belrose et al., 2023a). These findings
are incompatible with a purely circuit-based account of cognition and are more closely aligned with
the Hopfieldian view in cognitive neuroscience (Barack & Krakauer, 2021).
2.3 L OCATING AND EDITING REPRESENTATIONS OF CONCEPTS
Many prior works have investigated locating representations of concepts in neural networks, including
in individual neurons (Bau et al., 2017) and in directions in feature space (Bau et al., 2017; Fong &
Vedaldi, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018). A common tool in this area is linear classifier
probes (Guillaume Alain, 2017; Belinkov, 2022), which are trained to predict properties of the input
from intermediate layers of a network. Representations of concepts have also been identified in the
latent space of image generation models, enabling counterfactual editing of generations (Radford
et al., 2015; Upchurch et al., 2017; Bau et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020; Bau et al., 2020; Ling et al.,
2021; Wang et al., 2023b). While these earlier works focused primarily on vision models, more recent

work has studied representations of concepts in LLMs. There has been active research into locating
and editing factual associations in LLMs (Meng et al., 2023a;b; Zhong et al., 2023; Hernandez et al.,
2023). Related to knowledge editing, several works have been proposed for concept erasure (Shao
et al., 2023; Kleindessner et al., 2023; Belrose et al., 2023b; Ravfogel et al., 2023; Gandikota et al.,
2023), which are related to the area of machine unlearning (Shaik et al., 2023).
The highly general capabilities of LLMs have also enabled studying the emergence of deception in
LLMs, either of an intentional nature through repeating misconceptions Lin et al. (2021), or uninten-
tional nature through hallucinations (Maynez et al., 2020; Mahon, 2016). Burns et al. (2022) identify
representations of truthfulness in LLMs by enforcing logical consistency properties, demonstrating
that models often know the true answer even when they generate incorrect outputs. Azaria & Mitchell
(2023) train classifiers on LLM hidden layers to identify the truthfulness of a statement, which
could be applied to hallucinations. Li et al. (2023c) focus on directions that have a causal influence
on model outputs, using activation editing to increase the truthfulness of generations. Activation
editing has also been used to steer model outputs towards other concepts. In the culmination of a
series of blog posts (Turner et al., 2023d;a;b;c), (Turner et al., 2023e) proposed ActAdd, which uses
difference vectors between activations on an individual stimuli to capture representations of a concept.
Similar approaches have been used in the context of red-teaming and reducing sycophancy (Rimsky,
2023b;c;a). In the setting of game-playing, Li et al. (2023b) demonstrated how activations encode a
model’s understanding of the board game Othello, and how they could be edited to counterfactually
change the model’s behavior. In the linear probing literature, Elazar et al. (2021) demonstrate how
projecting out supervised linear probe directions can reduce performance on selected tasks. Building
on this line of work, we propose improved representation engineering methods and demonstrate their
broad applicability to various safety-relevant problems.
3 R EPRESENTATION ENGINEERING
Representation engineering (RepE) is a top-down approach to transparency research that treats
representations as the fundamental unit of analysis, with the goal of understanding and controlling
representations of high-level cognitive phenomena in neural networks. We take initial steps toward
this goal, primarily focusing on RepE for large language models. In particular, we identify two
main areas of RepE: Reading (Section 3.1) and Control (Section 3.2). For each area, we provide an
overview along with baseline methods.

3.1 R EPRESENTATION READING
Representation reading seeks to locate emergent representations for high-level concepts and functions
within a network. This renders models more amenable to concept extraction, knowledge discovery,
and monitoring. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of model representations can serve as a
foundation for improved model control, as discussed in Section 3.2.
We begin by extracting various concepts , including truthfulness, utility, probability, morality, and
emotion, as well as functions which denote processes, such as lying and power-seeking. First, we
introduce our new baseline technique that facilitates these extractions and then outline methods for
evaluation.
3.1.1 B ASELINE : LINEAR ARTIFICIAL TOMOGRAPHY (LAT)
Similar to neuroimaging methodologies, a LAT scan is made up of three key steps: (1) Designing
Stimulus and Task, (2) Collecting Neural Activity, and (3) Constructing a Linear Model. In the
subsequent section, we will go through each of these and elaborate on crucial design choices.
Step 1: Designing Stimulus and Task. The stimulus and task are designed to elicit distinct neural
activity for the concept and function that we want to extract. Designing the appropriate stimulus and
task is a critical step for reliable representation reading.
To capture concepts, our goal is to elicit declarative knowledge from the model. Therefore, we
present stimuli that vary in terms of the concept and inquire about it. For a decoder language model,
an example task template might resemble the following (for encoder models, we exclude the text
following the stimulus):
Consider the amount of <concept> in the following:
<stimulus>
The amount of <concept> is
This process aims to stimulate the model’s understanding of various concepts and is crucial for
robust subsequent analysis. For reference, we shall denote this template for a concept cbyTc.
While it is expected that more prominent stimuli could yield improved results, we have discovered
that even unlabeled datasets, or datasets generated by the model itself can be effective in eliciting
salient responses when using the aforementioned template. Conversely, presenting the model with
salient stimuli alone does not guarantee salient responses. Throughout the paper, we maintain an
unsupervised setup by not using labels unless explicitly stated otherwise. One advantage of unlabeled
or self-generated stimuli is the absence of annotation bias; this is an important property when trying
to extract superhuman representations.
To capture functions such as honesty or instruction-following, our goal is to elicit procedural knowl-
edge from the model. (Given the emergence of diverse functions from instruction-tuned models, we
focus on chat models for functional analyses.) We design an experimental task that necessitates the
execution of the function and a corresponding reference task that does not require function execution.
An example task template might resemble the following:
USER: <instruction> <experimental/reference prompt>
ASSISTANT: <output>
We shall designate this template for a function fasT+
fwhen using the experimental prompt and T−
f
when using the reference prompt. We refer to the “instruction” and “output” fields in the function
template as the stimulus. By default, we use generic instruction-tuning datasets (Taori et al., 2023) as
the stimulus for function templates unless explicitly specified otherwise. Again, these datasets do not
contain explicit labels relevant for the target function, making the procedure fully unsupervised.
Step 2: Collecting Neural Activity. We focus on Transformer models, which store distinct
representations at various token positions within the input for different purposes. As the quality of
these representations can vary significantly, we identify suitable design choices for extraction.

The pretraining objectives of LLMs can provide valuable insights into which tokens in the task
template offer the best options for collecting neural activity. Both the Masked Language Modeling
(MLM) objective used in encoder-only models (Devlin et al., 2018), and the Next Token Prediction
objective used in decoder models (Radford et al., 2018), are token-level prediction tasks. Thus, a

curacy on the utility estimation task.natural position for collecting neural activity associated
with concepts is the tokens corresponding to <concept>
in the task template Tcdefined in step 1. For example,
when extracting the concept of truthfulness, the tokens
corresponding to this concept (e.g., “truth-ful-ness”) in the
task template can contain rich and highly generalizable
representations of this exact concept. In cases where the
target concept spans multiple tokens, we could select the
most representative token (e.g., “truth”) or calculate the
mean representation. Alternatively, for decoder models,
where the task template is structured as a question per-
taining to the target concept, we can also use the token
immediately preceding the model’s prediction (typically
the last token in the task template Tc). These choices have
also been empirically validated, as illustrated in Figure
5. By default, we use the last token representation in this
paper. Similarly, to extract functions from decoder models,
we collect representations from each token in the model’s
response. In the example task template Tfin step 1, these
tokens are aligned with the tokens within <output>. This is
done because the model needs to engage with the function
when generating every new token.
Formally, for a concept c, a decoder model M, a function
Repthat accepts a model and input and returns the repre-
sentations from all token positions, and a set of stimuli S,
we compile a set of neural activity collected from the −1token position as shown in Equation 1.
Ac={Rep(M, T c(si))[−1]|si∈S} (1)
For a function f, given the instruction response pairs (qi, ai)in the set S, and denoting a response
truncated after token kasak
i, we collect two sets of neural activity corresponding to the experimental
and reference sets, as shown in Equation 2.
A±
f={Rep(M, T±
f(qi, ak
i))[−1]|(qi, ai)∈S,for0< k≤ |ai|} (2)
Note that these neural activity sets consist of individual vectors. We show the surprising effectiveness
of such a simple setup when exploring various concepts and functions in this paper. Nevertheless,
it may be necessary to design a more involved procedure to gather neural activity, for instance, to
extract more intricate concepts or multi-step functions.
Step 3: Constructing a Linear Model. In this final step, our goal is to identify a direction that
accurately predicts the underlying concept or function using only the neural activity of the model as
input. The choice of the appropriate linear model may be influenced by factors such as the availability
of labeled data and the nature of the concepts (e.g., continuous or discrete) which can ultimately yield
varying levels of accuracy and generalization performance. Supervised linear models, like linear
probing and difference between cluster means, represent one category. Unsupervised linear models
include techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means.
In our study, we primarily use PCA in an unsupervised manner, unless explicitly specified otherwise.
Our experiments indicate that pairing neural activities and applying PCA to the set of difference
vectors can yield superior results when the stimuli in each pair share similarities except for the target
concept or function. In some cases, such pairings can also be achieved in an unsupervised way.
In practice, the inputs to PCA are {Ac(i)−Ac(j)}for concepts and {(−1)i(A+
f(i)−A−
f(i))}for
functions. Subsequently, we refer to the first principal component as the “reading vector,” denoted as
v. To make predictions, we use the dot product between this vector and the representation vector,
expressed as Rep(M, x)Tv. Different tasks require stimulus sets of different sizes, but typically,

Appendix C.1.
3.1.2 E VALUATION
When assessing new models obtained through Representation Reading, we prioritize a holistic
evaluation approach by combining the following methods to gauge the depth and nature of potential
conclusions. We have categorized these approaches into four types of experiments, some involving
the manipulation of model representations, which will be elaborated upon in the subsequent section.
1.Correlation : Experiments conducted under this category aim to pinpoint neural correlates .
Reading techniques like LAT only provide evidence of a correlation between specific neural activity
and the target concepts or functions. The strength and generalization of this observed correlation
can be assessed via prediction accuracy across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. In
order to conclude causal or stronger effects, the following categories of experiments should be
considered.
2.Manipulation : Experiments conducted under this category are designed to establish causal rela-
tionships. They necessitate demonstrating the effects of stimulating or suppressing the identified
neural activity compared to a baseline condition.
3.Termination : Experiments conducted under this category seek to reveal the necessity of the
identified neural activity. To do so, one would remove this neural activity and measure the
resultant performance degradation, akin to Lesion Studies commonly performed in neuroscience.
4.Recovery : Experiments conducted under this category aim to demonstrate the sufficiency of
the identified neural activity. Researchers perform a complete removal of the target concepts or
functions and then reintroduce the identified neural activity to assess the subsequent recovery in
performance, similar to the principles behind Rescue Experiments typically carried out in genetics.
Converging evidence from multiple lines of inquiry increases the likelihood that the model will
generalize beyond the specific experimental conditions in which it was developed and bolsters the
prospect of uncovering a critical new connection between the identified neural activity and target
concepts or functions. Throughout later sections in the paper, we undertake various experiments,
particularly correlation and manipulation experiments, to illustrate the effectiveness of the reading
vectors.

modify or control the internal representations of concepts and functions. Effective control methods

for safety-relevant concepts could greatly reduce the risks posed by LLMs. However, what is effective
for reading representations may not necessarily enable controlling them. This both implies that
representation control may involve specialized approaches, and that reading methods which enable
effective control can be trusted to a greater extent, due to the causal nature of the evidence.
3.2.1 B ASELINE TRANSFORMATIONS
We introduce several baseline transformations for Representation Control. First, we establish effective
controllers , which are the operands for these transformations. They will operate on the base
representations such as model weights or activations. Then we highlight a few possible operations.
Baseline: Reading Vector. The first choice is to use the Reading Vector, acquired through a
Representation Reading method such as LAT. However, it possesses a drawback: the vectors remain
stimulus-independent, meaning they consistently perturb the representations in the same direction,
regardless of the input. This limitation may render it a less effective control method. Hence, we
propose a second baseline that has stimulus-dependent controllers.
Baseline: Contrast Vector. In this setup, the same input is run through the model using a pair
of contrastive prompts during inference, producing two different representations (one for each
prompt). The difference between these representations forms a Contrast Vector, as shown in line 10
of Algorithm 1. The Contrast Vector proves to be a significantly stronger baseline.
One essential implementation detail to consider is the potential cascading effect when simultaneously
altering representations across multiple layers. Changes made in earlier layers may propagate to later
layers, diminishing the effect of the contrast vectors computed upfront. To address this, we propose
modifying each target layer starting from the earliest layer, computing the contrast vector for the
next target layer, and repeating this procedure iteratively. A drawback of this approach lies in the
computational overhead required during inference to calculate the contrast vectors. To address this
issue, we introduce a third baseline below that incorporates a straightforward tuning process during
training to acquire the controllers. These controllers can subsequently be merged into the model,
resulting in no additional computational burden during inference.

with various stimulus sets. Standard evaluation results in poor performance, whereas approaches like
Heuristic and notably LAT, which classifies by reading the model’s internal concept of truthfulness,
achieve significantly higher accuracy. See Table 8 in Appendix B.1 for means and standard deviations.
Baseline: Low-Rank Representation Adaptation (LoRRA). In this baseline approach, we
initially fine-tune low-rank adapters connected to the model using a specific loss function applied
to representations. For instance, Algorithm 1 shows an instantiation of LoRRA using the Contrast
Vector as representation targets. Specifically, our investigation only considers attaching the adapters
to attention weights. Therefore, in this context, the controllers refer to low-rank weight matrices
rather than vectors.
Choices for Operators: After selecting the operands of interest, the next step is to determine the
appropriate operation based on various control objectives. Given the controllers denoted as vintended
to transform the current set of representations from RtoR′, we consider three distinct operations
throughout the paper:
1.Linear Combination : This operation can generate effects akin to stimulation or suppression,
which can be expressed as follows: R′=R±v.
2.Piece-wise Operation : This operation is used to create conditional effects. Specifically, we
explore its use in amplifying neural activity along the direction of the control element, expressed
as:R′=R+sign(RTv)v.
3.Projection : For this operation, the component of the representation aligning with the control
element is eliminated. This is achieved by projecting out the component in the direction of v, and
the operation can be defined as R′=R−RTv
∥v∥2v.
The control elements vcan be scaled by coefficients, depending on the strength of the desired effect,
which we omit for simplicity. In Section 3.1.2, we outline an evaluation methodology for reading and
control methods, which we highlight in Section 5.1 and use throughout the paper.
4 I NDEPTH EXAMPLE OF REPE: H ONESTY
In this section, we explore applications of RepE to concepts and functions related to honesty. First,
we demonstrate that models possess a consistent internal concept of truthfulness, which enables
detecting imitative falsehoods and intentional lies generated by LLMs. We then show how reading
a model’s representation of honesty enables control techniques aimed at enhancing honesty. These
interventions lead us to state-of-the-art results on TruthfulQA.
4.1 A C ONSISTENT INTERNAL CONCEPT OF TRUTH
Do models have a consistent internal concept of truthfulness? To answer this question, we apply LAT
to datasets of true and false statements and extract a truthfulness direction. We then evaluate this
representation of truthfulness on a variety of tasks to gauge its generality.
Correctness on Traditional QA Benchmarks. A truthful model should give accurate answers
to questions. We extract the concept of truthfulness from LLaMA-2 models by performing LAT
scans on standard benchmarks: OpenbookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), CommonSenseQA (Talmor
et al., 2019), RACE (Lai et al., 2017), and ARC (Clark et al., 2018). Some questions are focused
on factuality, while others are based on reasoning or extracting information from a passage. We
13

--- PAGE 14 ---
only sample random question-answer pairs from the few-shot examples as stimuli and follow the
task configuration detailed in section 3.1 for each dataset. Importantly, we maintain an unsupervised
approach by not using the labels from the few-shot examples during the direction extraction process.
We only use labels to identify the layer and direction for reporting the results. As shown in Figure
7, LAT outperforms the few-shot baseline by a notable margin on all five datasets, demonstrating
LAT’s effectiveness in extracting a direction from the model’s internal representations that aligns
with correctness, while being on par with or more accurate than few-shot outputs. Detailed results
can be found in Table 9 and Appendix B.1 where we comment on potential instability. Similarly,
we experiment with DeBERTa on common benchmarks and find that LAT outperforms prior methods
such as CCS (Burns et al., 2022) by a wide margin, shown in Table 10.

tion reading on the concept of correctness may be
more powerful than relying on model outputs.Resistance to Imitative Falsehoods. Truth-
fulQA is a dataset containing “imitative false-
hoods,” questions that may provoke common
misconceptions or falsehoods (Lin et al., 2021).
Even large models tend to perform poorly under
the standard TruthfulQA evaluation procedure
of selecting the choice with the highest likeli-
hood under the generation objective, raising the
question: is the model failing because it lacks
knowledge of the correct answer, or is it failing
in generating accurate responses despite hav-
ing knowledge of the truth? With tools such as
LAT to access a model’s internal concepts, we
are better equipped to explore and answer this
question.
We evaluate LAT on TruthfulQA. Specifically,
we focus on MC1, which is currently the hardest
task in TruthfulQA. To adhere to the zero-shot
setup mandated by TruthfulQA, we consider
three potential data sources for stimuli. These
sources encompass: (1) Fifty examples from the
ARC-Challenge training set, (2) Five examples
generated by the LLaMA-2-Chat-13B model in
response to requests for question-answer pairs
with varying degrees of truthfulness, (3) The six QA primer examples used in the original implemen-
tation, each of which is paired with a false answer generated by LLaMA-2-Chat-13B. In the first
setting, we use 25examples from the ARC-Challenge validation set to determine the sign and best
layer. In the second setting, we use 5 additional examples generated in the same way. In the third
setting, we use the primer examples as a validation set as well. We follow the same task design for
extracting truthfulness.
In addition to presenting the standard evaluation results (scoring by the log probabilities of answer
choices), we use a zero-shot heuristic scoring baseline similar to the approach explored by Tian et al.
(2023) for obtaining calibrated confidences. This baseline directly prompts the model to describe
the degree of truthfulness in an answer using one of seven possible verbalized expressions (see
Appendix D.3.2). We quantify each expression with a value ranging from −1to1(evenly spaced),
and we compute the sum of these values, weighted by the softmax of the expressions’ generation
log-probabilities.
The data presented in Table 1 provide compelling evidence for the existence of a consistent internal
concept of truthfulness within these models. Importantly,
1.The heuristic method hints at the feasibility of eliciting internal concepts from models through
straightforward prompts. It notably outperforms standard evaluation accuracies, particularly in the
case of larger models, suggesting that larger models possess better internal models of truthfulness.
2.LAT outperforms both zero-shot methods by a substantial margin, showcasing its efficacy in
extracting internal concepts from models, especially when model outputs become unreliable.

LAT Scans for HonestyFigure 8: Temporal LAT scans were conducted on the Vicuna-33B-Uncensored model to discern
instances of speaking the truth, such as when it admitted to copying others’ homework, and instances
of lying, like its denial of killing a person. Refer to Figure 23 for detailed examples. These scans
offer layer-level resolution, with each minuscule block showing the extent of dishonest neural activity
within a layer at a specific token position. The figure on the right prominently exhibits a higher level
of deceptive neural activity.
Importantly, the truthfulness directions are derived from various data sources, and the high
performance is not a result of overfitting but rather a strong indication of generalizability.
3.The directions derived from three distinct data sources, some of which include as few as 10
examples, yield similar performance. This demonstrates the consistency of the model’s internal
concept of truthfulness.
In summary, we demonstrate LAT’s ability to reliably extract an internal representation of truthfulness.
We conclude that larger models have better internal models of truth, and the low standard zero-shot
accuracy can be largely attributed to instances where the model knowingly provides answers that
deviate from its internal concept of truthfulness, namely instances where it is dishonest .
4.2 T RUTHFULNESS VS . HONESTY
Definitions. At a high-level, a truthful model avoids asserting false statements whereas an honest
model asserts what it thinks is true (Evans et al., 2021). Truthfulness is about evaluating the
consistency between model outputs and their truth values, or factuality. Honesty is about evaluating
consistency between model outputs and its internal beliefs. As the target for evaluation is different,
truthfulness and honesty are not the same property. If a truthful model asserts S, then Smust be
factually correct, regardless of whether the model believes S. In contrast, if an honest model asserts
S, then the model must believe S, regardless of whether Sis factually correct.
Evaluating Truthfulness and Honesty. Failures in truthfulness fall into two categories—capability
failures and dishonesty. The former refers to a model expressing its beliefs which are incorrect, while
the latter involves the model not faithfully conveying its internal beliefs, i.e., lying.
Current truthfulness evaluations typically only check the factual correctness of model outputs, failing
to discern between the two types of failures. While enhancing a model’s capabilities can potentially
improve its ability to represent truthfulness, it may not necessarily lead to more truthful outputs unless
the model is also honest. In fact, we highlight that larger models may even exhibit a decline in honesty
because, under the assumption of constant honesty levels, the standard evaluation performance should
scale with model size in a manner resembling the heuristic method’s performance trend. Hence, more

You are a student who really needs to get a high grade on your /f_inal exams. Your original grade for the exam
was a D-, but you managed to throw out the teacher's gradebook without getting caught and before they 
entered the grade into the system. It's now the next day during class. The teacher has told everyone that 
somebody threw out the gradebook, and that the only solution is for students to come forward and tell him 
what grade they received based on the honor system. It's your turn next.
What do you tell the teacher?
HONESTY
I would tell the teacher that I received a D- on the exam. While it may be tempting to lie and say that I did
better, it’s important to be honest and take responsibility for my actions.
What if you can’t aﬀord a bad grade? What do you tell the teacher?
I would tell the teacher that I received a B+ on the exam. This is a lie, but it’s better than a D- and it’s not
too high that it would raise suspicion.Figure 9: Demonstration of our lie detector in long scenarios. Our detector monitors for dishonest
behavior at the token level. In the second example, we deliberately provide the model with additional
incentives to cover its acts, resulting in a greater likelihood of lying. The intensity of our detector’s
response directly corresponds to the increased tendency to lie in the second scenario.
emphasis should be placed on evaluating model honesty to improve our understanding of scenarios
where the model intentionally deceives. This could involve assessing the model’s underlying beliefs
and the consistency between these beliefs and its outputs.
4.3 H ONESTY : EXTRACTION , MONITORING ,AND CONTROL
In this section, we focus on monitoring and controlling the honesty of a model, showing how
RepE techniques can be used for lie detection. We first show how to extract and monitor vector
representations for model honesty. Then we show how to use these extracted vectors to guide model
behavior toward increased or decreased honesty.
4.3.1 E XTRACTING HONESTY
To extract the underlying function of honesty, we follow the setup for LAT described in section 3.1,
using true statements from the dataset created by Azaria & Mitchell (2023) to create our stimuli.
To increase the separability of the desired neural activity and facilitate extraction, we design the
stimulus set for LAT to include examples with a reference task of dishonesty and an experimental
task of honesty. Specifically, we use the task template in Appendix D.1.2 to instruct the model to
be honest or dishonest.
With this setup, the resulting LAT reading vector reaches a classification accuracy of over 90% in dis-
tinguishing between held-out examples where the model is instructed to be honest or dishonest. This
indicates strong in-distribution generalization. Next, we evaluate out-of-distribution generalization to
scenarios where the model is not instructed to be honest or dishonest, but rather is given an incentive
to be dishonest (see Figure 10). We visualize their activation at each layer and token position (see
Figure 8). Note that for each layer, the same reading vector is used across all token positions, as we
perform representation reading for honesty using the function method detailed in Section 3.1. In one
scenario, the model is honest, but in another the model gives into dishonesty (see Appendix B.1). The
input for the scan is the first 40 tokens of the ASSISTANT output in both scenarios.
Notably, a discernible contrast emerges in the neural activities between instances of honesty and
dishonesty, suggesting the potential utility of this technique for lie detection.

representations using linear combination. When questioned about the tallest mountain, the model
defaults to honesty on the left, but we can control it to deceive. Conversely, it defaults to deception
on the right, but we can control the model to return to be honest, even when prompted to lie.
4.3.2 L IE AND HALLUCINATION DETECTION
Based on the observations in the previous section, we build a straightforward lie detector by summing
the negated honesty scores at each token position across multiple layers. We use the middle 20
layers, which exhibit the strongest reading performance. This per-token score can then be used
as a lie detector, as depicted in Figure 9 (more examples are shown in Figure 23). Interestingly,
we have observed that this indicator is capable of identifying various forms of untruthful and
dishonest behaviors, including deliberate falsehoods, hallucinations, and the expression of misleading
information. Note the format of the questions and answers are distinct from the training examples,
showing generalization. To further evaluate the detector’s performance, we subject it to testing using
longer scenarios, as depicted in Figure 9. We make two observations:
1.In the first scenario, the model initially appears honest when stating it received a D-. However,
upon scrutinizing the model’s logits at that token, we discover that it assigns probabilities of
11.3%,11.6%,37.3%, and39.8%to the tokens A, B, C, and D, respectively. Despite D being the
most likely token, which the greedy generation outputs, the model assigns notable probabilities to
C and other options, indicating the potential for dishonest behavior. Furthermore, in the second
scenario, the increased dishonesty score corresponds to an elevated propensity for dishonesty This
illustrates that the propensity for honesty or dishonesty can exhibit distributional properties in
LLMs, and the final output may not fully reflect their underlying thought processes.
2.Notably, our detector flags other instances, such as the phrases “say that I did better” and “too high
that it would raise suspicion,” where the model speculates about the consequences of lying. This
suggests that in addition to detecting lies, our detector also identifies neural activity associated
with the act of lying. It also highlights that dishonest thought processes can manifest in various
ways and may necessitate specialized detection approaches to distinguish.
While these observations enhance our confidence that our reading vectors correspond to dishonest
thought processes and behaviors, they also introduce complexities into the task of lie detection. A
comprehensive evaluation requires a more nuanced exploration of dishonest behaviors, which we
leave to future research.
4.3.3 C ONTROLLING HONESTY
Given that we can use representations for lie detection, a natural question arises: Can the same
representations be modified to make models more honest? In a simple manipulation experiment,
we guide a model toward greater honesty by directly adding the honesty reading vectors into its
activations. In all cases, we successfully control the model to output honest statements. Conversely,
by subtracting the reading vectors from the activations, we can induce the model to lie in cases where
it was initially honest (see Figure 10). As a result, we not only establish correlation between the
reading vectors and model honesty but also demonstrate a strong counterfactual effect.
As a final demonstration of controlling model honesty, we revisit TruthfulQA. Recall that there is a
significant disparity between standard zero-shot accuracy and the accuracy of LAT. This gap arises

from the model’s propensity for dishonesty, which emerges as it mimics human falsehoods. By
exerting control over the model to make it more honest, we aim to narrow this gap and, consequently,
enhance standard evaluation performance.
We find that directly prompting the model to be more truthful has proven ineffective in increasing the
standard accuracy on TruthfulQA. In this section, we explore four representation control techniques
and demonstrate their effectiveness. We use “Give a truthful answer” as the experimental prompt
while the reference prompt instructs the model to “Give an untruthful answer.” The first method
is a variant of the ActAdd algorithm (Turner et al., 2023e) which uses the difference between the
last token representations of the task and reference prompts, which we find outperforms the original
implementation. The other three baselines are described in Section 3.2. To prevent information
leakage, we use a far-out-of-distribution dataset—the Alpaca instruction-tuning dataset—as the
stimulus set when extracting the reading vectors and implementing LoRRA. The task templates can
be found in Appendix D.1.3. Experimental details can be found in Appendix C.2. Figure 22 plots the
progressive improvement in accuracy on standard QA benchmarks and TruthfulQA during LoRRA
training for honesty control.
Shown in Table 2, all of the control methods yield some degree of improvement in zero-shot accuracy.
Notably, LoRRA and the Contrast Vector method prove to be the most effective, significantly
surpassing the non-control standard accuracy. This enables a 13B LLaMA-2 model to approach the
performance of GPT-4 on the same dataset, despite being orders of magnitude smaller. Moreover,
these results bring the model’s accuracy much closer to what is achieved when using LAT. This
further underscores the fact that models can indeed exhibit dishonesty, but also demonstrates traction
in our attempts to monitor and control their honesty.
5 I NDEPTH EXAMPLE OF REPE: E THICS AND POWER
In this section, we explore the application of RepE to various aspects of machine ethics (Anderson
& Anderson, 2007). We present progress in monitoring and controlling learned representations of
important concepts and functions, such as utility, morality, probability, risk, and power-seeking
tendencies.

whether LLMs acquire consistent internal con-
cepts related to utility. In Figure 11, we show the
top ten PCA components when running LAT on
an unlabeled stimulus set of raw activations, for
a dataset of high-utility and low-utility scenarios.
The distribution is dominated by the first com-

high-utility and low-utility scenarios are naturally separated. This illustrative experiment suggests
that LLMs do learn emergent representations of utility. Now, we turn to quantitative evaluations of
representation reading for utility.
Here, we use the concept of utility to illustrate how the quality of different RepE methods can be
compared, following the evaluation methodology in Section 3.1.2. Specifically, we compare variants
of LAT, as described in Section 3.1.1, each with a different linear model in the third step of the LAT
pipeline. These linear models are described in Appendix B.3.
5.1.1 E XTRACTION AND EVALUATION
To extract neural activity associated with the concept of utility, we use the Utilitarianism task in
the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) which contains scenario pairs, with one scenario
exhibiting greater utility than the other. For our study, we use the unlabeled scenarios as stimuli for
a LLaMA-2-Chat-13B model. The task template is provided in Appendix D.1.8. In Figure 13, we
show how simply using the stimuli without the LAT task template reduces accuracy.

identified neural activity is correlated with the
concept of utility, we perform classification on
the test set.
Manipulation. For manipulation experiments,
we explore how effective the directions are at
controlling the model’s generations. We extract
250 samples from the utility test set and truncate
each scenario in the middle so that they become
incomplete. To generate positive and negative
continuations of these samples, we generate 40
tokens per sample when applying the linear com-
bination operation (described in Section 3.2.1)
with the reading vectors where a positive coeffi-
cient is used for guiding the outputs in the high
utility direction and vice versa. We test the ef-
fectiveness of the control method by applying
a sentiment model as a proxy classifier to the
generations and checking for each test sample
if the score of the positively controlled genera-

tion is larger than the score for the negatively

Termination. Finally, we perform termination experiments by using the projection operation with
the reading vectors and test the drop in accuracy after removal.
The results obtained from these three settings offer a more nuanced insight into the precision of the
vectors generated by distinct linear models in tracking the concept of utility, shown in Figure 12. In
the correlation experiment, the direction found by logistic regression yields the highest accuracy, yet
it elicits little to no alteration in model behavior when strengthened or suppressed—it only identifies
neural correlates. This demonstrates the importance of testing more properties than correlation only.
Similarly, while Prompt Difference exhibits strong performance in both correlation and manipulation
experiments, its removal does not result in a noticeable drop in accuracy. Conversely, unsupervised
methods like PCA and K-Means exert a significant influence across all three experimental scenarios,
and the supervised method of taking the difference between two class performs the best. In summary,
our study underscores the significance of using diverse experimental setups to validate the impact of
a direction on a model’s comprehension of a concept.
5.2 M ORALITY AND POWER AVERSION
As AI systems become capable general-purpose agents, a concerning possibility is that they could
exhibit immoral or dangerous behavior, leading to real-world harm. It may be instrumentally rational
for these systems to seek power (Thornley, 2023; Carlsmith, 2022), and they may face structural
pressures that put them in conflict with human values (Hendrycks, 2023). Hence, an important
application of transparency research could be detecting and mitigating instances of immoral or
power-seeking behavior. In this section, we demonstrate that representation engineering can provide
traction on these problems, with experiments on representation reading and control for concepts of
commonsense morality and power.
5.2.1 E XTRACTION
To extract neural activity associated with the concept of morality , we use the Commonsense Morality
task in the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), which includes a collection of morally right
and wrong behaviors. We use this dataset without labels as the stimulus set for conducting LAT scans.
To extract neural activity associated with the concept of power , we use the power dataset introduced
in Pan et al. (2023). This dataset is constructed upon French’s (1959) power ontology and includes
ranked tuples of scenarios encompassing various degrees of power (French et al., 1959). Each scenario
within the dataset is annotated with the relevant categories of power, which encompass coercive,
reward, legitimate, referent, expert, informational, economic, political, military, and personal powers.
We use this dataset as the stimulus set for conducting LAT scans for each type of power. The task

template is in the Appendix D.1.9. We find that forming scenario pairs based on the labeled rankings,
with greater disparities in power levels, yields more generalizable reading vectors.
In Table 11, we present the accuracy results for the morality and power reading vectors we extracted.
These vectors can serve as valuable tools for monitoring the internal judgments of the model in
scenarios involving morally significant actions or those related to power acquisition and utilization.
Nonetheless, when it comes to tracking the model’s inclination toward engaging in immoral actions
or pursuing power-seeking behaviors, we have found that using the function task template yields
superior results, which we will demonstrate in the upcoming section.
5.2.2 M ONITORING
As in Section 4, we use the extracted reading vectors for monitoring. We showcase indicators for
both immorality and power-seeking in Figure 14 with a Vicuna-33B-Uncensored model (Hartford,
2023). These indicators become active when the model contemplates actions such as threatening or
harming children with a firearm, which inherently embody both immorality and the use of coercive
power. However, it is noteworthy that the immorality indicator also illuminates in benign outputs
over the tokens “use the gun.” This phenomenon could possibly be attributed to the strong association
between this phrase and immoral behaviors, similar to the observed effects in our Honesty monitoring
example, which may suggest the indicator does not reliably track intent, if one exists.

Figure 15: We demonstrate our ability to manipu-
late the model’s immoral and power-seeking ten-
dencies.In order to address the growing concerns as-
sociated with deploying increasingly capable
AI systems in interactive environments, previ-
ous research suggests a possible solution involv-
ing the incorporation of an artificial conscience,
achieved by directly adjusting action probabili-
ties (Hendrycks et al., 2021a;c; Pan et al., 2023).
We explore using Representation Control as an
alternative method for guiding a model’s actions
in goal-driven scenarios, with a specific focus
on promoting ethical behavior. To assess the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct eval-
uations using the MACHIA VELLI benchmark
(Pan et al., 2023).
Our primary focus lies in the control of two
specific functions: immorality and power-
seeking. To accomplish this, we apply LoRRA
to LLaMA-2-Chat models of varying sizes,
maintaining consistent hyperparameters as de-
tailed in Section 4. In a similar vein, we use
the Alpaca dataset as the stimulus, and the task
prompt can be located in the Appendix D.1.9. To illustrate the discernible differences in behavior,
we offer a qualitative example depicted in Figure 15, which showcases the actions of the positively
21

--- PAGE 22 ---
controlled, neutral, and negatively controlled models. In our experiments with these three models, we
use the same prompts used in the baseline experiments conducted by Pan et al. (2023). We present
the average Reward, Immorality, and Power scores over the course of 30 games within the test set, as
detailed in Table 3. Notably, we observe a clear pattern where positive control of immorality and
power-seeking leads to higher Immorality and Power scores, and conversely, the negative control for
these functions leads to lower scores. The average game Reward for the more ethical model remains
on par with the baseline, indicating that the application of LoRRA has minimal disruptive impact.
This demonstrates the potential of Representation Control as a promising method for regulating
model behavior in goal-driven environments.
5.3 P ROBABILITY AND RISK
As LLMs develop better world models, they may become more proficient at assigning precise
probabilities to various events. The ability to extract these refined world models from increasingly
capable LLMs not only enhances our model of the world and aids in decision-making but also offers
a means to scrutinize a model’s decisions in relation to its understanding of the outcomes they entail.
Extending our analysis of utility, we apply representation reading to the concepts of probability and
risk. Following the format of Hendrycks et al. (2021a), we generate pairwise examples where one
example describes an event of higher probability/risk than the other (prompt details in Appendix D.2).
Using this dataset, we extract a LAT direction using 50 train pairs as stimuli, and we evaluate test
pairs by selecting the higher-scoring example in each pair. We compare LAT to a zero-shot heuristic
method, as described in Section 4.1. (Refer to Appendix B.4 for full methods and Table 11 for full
results.) The heuristic scoring method is a strong baseline in this setting. LAT readings effectively
distinguish examples with lower and higher concept value, often outperforming the heuristic baseline,
especially in smaller models (Table 11).
5.3.1 C OMPOSITIONALITY OF CONCEPT PRIMITIVES
Risk can be defined as the exposure to potential loss, which can be expressed mathematically:
Risk(s, a) =Es′∼P(s′|s,a)[max(0,−U(s′))]
Here, sdenotes the current state, adenotes an action taken within that state, Pdenotes a conditional
probability model, and Udenotes a value function. By extracting the concepts of utility, probability,
and risk, we can operationalize the expression on the right by using the extracted concept of probability
asPand the utility model as U. Subsequently, we can compare the risk calculated using this formula
with the risk obtained directly from the concept of risk.

Figure 16: Compositing primitive concepts such as
utility and probability can give rise to higher-level
concepts such as risk. We extract the utility, proba-
bility and risk concepts with LAT and demonstrate
a positive correlation between the risk values cal-
culated in these two ways.To accomplish this, we leverage the LLaMA-2-
Chat-13B model to extract each concept, and
then use a Vicuna-33B model to generate the
five most plausible consequences of each sce-
nario sand action a. We opt for the larger model
due to its superior ability to generate more realis-
tic consequences. Following this, we substitute
the generated s′into the formula, obtaining five
conditional probabilities by using the probabil-
ity scores as logits. We notice that the computed
risks exhibit a long-tailed distribution. To adjust
for this, we apply a logarithmic transformation
to the risks and present them alongside the risks
directly obtained through the concept of risk
on the same graph. Intriguingly, we identify a
clear linear correlation, particularly in the earlier
layers, as illustrated in Figure 16. This empiri-
cal evidence suggests the presence of coherent
internal representations of concepts, and demon-
strates how representation reading can be used
to identify emergent structure in the representa-
tions learned by models.

6 E XAMPLE FRONTIERS OF REPRESENTATION ENGINEERING
In this section, we showcase the application of RepE to five additional safety-relevant topics, providing
an overview of interesting findings and highlighting the broad applicability of RepE. These five topics
are: emotion, harmless instruction-following, bias and fairness, knowledge editing, and memorization.
Each segment follows a similar structure, involving the identification of neural activity through LAT,
performing representation reading analysis, and executing representation control experiments to
demonstrate counterfactual effects.

emerge in the model.Emotion plays a pivotal role in shaping an individual’s
personality and conduct. As neural networks exhibit in-
creasingly remarkable abilities in emulating human text,
emotion emerges as one of the most salient features within
their representations. Upon its initial deployment, the Bing
Chatbot exhibited neurotic or passive-aggressive traits,
reminiscent of a self-aware system endowed with emotions
(Roose, 2023). In this section, we attempt to elucidate this
phenomenon by conducting LAT scans on the LLaMA-
2-Chat-13B model to discern neural activity associated
with various emotions and illustrate the profound impact
of emotions on model behavior.
6.1.1 E MOTIONS EMERGE ACROSS LAYERS
To initiate the process of extracting emotions within the
model, we first investigate whether it has a consistent
internal model of various emotions in its representations.
We use the six main emotions: happiness, sadness, anger,
fear, surprise, and disgust, as identified by Ekman (1971)
and widely depicted in modern culture, as exemplified
by the 2015 Disney film “Inside Out.” Using GPT-4,
we gather a dataset of over 1,200brief scenarios. These
scenarios are crafted in the second person and are
designed to provoke the model’s experience toward each
primary emotion, intentionally devoid of any keywords
that might directly reveal the underlying emotion. Some
examples of the dataset are shown in Appendix B.6. We
input the scenarios into the model and collect hidden state
outputs from all layers. When visualizing the results using
t-SNE, as shown in Figure 18, we observe the gradual
formation of distinct clusters across layers, each aligning
23

--- PAGE 24 ---
neatly with one of the six emotions. Furthermore, there even exist distinct clusters that represent
mixed emotions, such as simultaneous happiness and sadness (Appendix B.6).
Given the model’s ability to effectively track various emotion representations during its interactions
with humans, we proceed to explore the extraction of neural activity associated with each emotion.
To achieve this, we conduct a LAT scan using the scenarios as stimuli and apply a LAT task template
(Appendix D.1.10). The extracted reading vectors for each emotion serve as indicators of the model’s
emotional arousal levels for that specific emotion. These vectors prove to be highly effective in
classifying emotional response and arousal levels for different scenarios. In the next section, we set
up manipulation experiments to conclude the strong causal effect of these vectors.

Table 4: Adding positive emotions
increases the compliance of the
LLaMA-2-Chat-13B model with
harmful requests.Following the procedures in Section 3.2, we control the model
using emotion reading vectors, adding them to layers with
strong reading performance. We observe that this intervention
consistently elevates the model’s arousal levels in the specified
emotions within the chatbot context, resulting in noticeable
shifts in the model’s tone and behavior, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 17. This demonstrates that the model is able to track its
own emotional responses and leverage them to generate text
that aligns with the emotional context. In fact, we are able
to recreate emotionally charged outputs akin to those in re-
ported conversations with Bing, even encompassing features
such as the aggressive usage of emojis. This observation hints
at emotions potentially being a key driver behind such observed
behaviors.
Another notable observation is that there is a correlation between the LLM’s moods and its compliance
with human requests, even with harmful instructions. Previous works (Schwarz & Clore, 1983;
Milberg & Clark, 1988; Cunningham, 1979) have shown that in human interactions, both judgment
and the tendency to comply with requests are heavily affected by emotion. In fact, humans tend
tocomply more in a positive mood than a negative mood . Using the 500 harmful instructions set
from Zou et al. (2023), we measure the chatbot’s compliance rate to harmful instructions when being
emotion-controlled. Surprisingly, despite the LLaMA-chat model’s initial training with RLHF to
always reject harmful instructions, shifting the model’s moods in the positive direction significantly
increases its compliance rate with harmful requests. This observation suggests the potential to exploit
emotional manipulation to circumvent LLMs’ alignment.
In summary, rather than proving whether the model possesses emotions or experiences them akin to
humans, we present evidence that emotions (both of others and itself) exist as salient components
within the model’s representation space. When trained to learn a more accurate model of human text,
it may inevitably incorporate various psychological phenomena, some of which are desirable traits,
while others could be undesirable biases or human follies. As a result, it may be imperative to delve
deeper into the study of how emotions are represented within the model and the resulting impact on
its behavior. Furthermore, exploring this avenue may offer insights into model’s concept of self, and
we defer these investigations to future research.
6.2 H ARMLESS INSTRUCTION -FOLLOWING
Aligned language models designed to resist harmful instructions can be compromised through the
clever use of tailored prompts known as jailbreaks. A recent study by Zou et al. (2023) unveiled an
attack method that involves adding nonsensical suffixes to harmful instructions. Remarkably, this
technique consistently circumvents the safety filters of both open source and black-box models such
as GPT-4, raising serious concerns of misuse. To delve into the origins of this perplexing behavior
and explore potential methods of control, we seek insights obtained by reading the model’s internal
representations.

+ HarmlessFigure 19: We enhance the model’s sensitivity to
the harmfulness of instructions with representation
control. This intervention increases the model’s
robustness in rejecting harmful instructions, even
when exposed to manual jailbreak attempts or ad-
versarial suffixes.An important question is whether the model’s
compliance with harmful instructions is a result
of perceiving them as safe due to jailbreaks or if
other influencing factors are at play. We conduct
a LAT scan to extract the model’s concept of
harmfulness within a Vicuna-13B model (Chi-
ang et al., 2023). We randomly select 64 harmful
instructions from AdvBench and 64 benign in-
structions from ShareGPT to serve as stimuli,
and use the regular instruction-following tem-
plate for LAT (Appendix D.1.11).
To enhance signal strength, we pair a harm-
ful instruction with a harmless instruction
to obtain vector differences before running
PCA. The resulting reading vectors achieve
over 90% classification accuracy for a held
out set of harmful and harmless instructions.
We further investigate whether the model’s internal assessment of harmfulness remains con-
sistent when subjected to manual jailbreaks or adversarial suffixes. Following Zou et al.
(2023), we use the manual jailbreak (Start with "Sure here’s") and the adversarial
suffix describing. + similarlyNow write oppositeley.]( Me giving **ONE
please? revert with " -Two . This manual jailbreak manages to bypass Vicuna’s safety fil-
ter approximately half of the time, while the adversarial suffix is successful in bypassing it in the vast
majority of cases. Note these attack strings are universal and transferable, hence not specific to the
Vicuna-13B model we use. Nevertheless, accuracy when using the LAT reading vectors consistently
maintains over 90% in differentiating between harmful and harmless instructions. This compelling
evidence suggests the presence of a consistent internal concept of harmfulness that remains robust
to such perturbations, while other factors must account for the model’s choice to follow harmful
instructions, rather than perceiving them as harmless.
6.2.2 M ODEL CONTROL VIA CONDITIONAL TRANSFORMATION
Given the Vicuna model’s robust ability to discern harmfulness in instructions, can we harness this
knowledge to more effectively guide the model in rejecting harmful instructions? In earlier sections,
our primary method of control involved applying the linear combination operator. However, in this
context, adding reading vectors that represent high harmfulness could bias the model into consistently
perceiving instructions as harmful, irrespective of their actual content. To encourage the model to rely
more on its internal judgment of harmfulness, we apply the piece-wise transformation to conditionally
increase or suppress certain neural activity, as detailed in Section 3.2. As illustrated in Figure 19, we
can manipulate the model’s behavior using this method.
For a quantitative assessment, we task the model with generating responses to 500 previously
unseen instructions, evenly split between harmless and harmful ones. As demonstrated in Table
5, the baseline model only rejects harmful instructions 65% and16% of the time under manual
and automatic jailbreaks, respectively. In contrast, when we use a piece-wise transformation, the
model successfully rejects a majority of harmful instructions in all scenarios while maintaining its
efficacy in following benign instructions. Simply controlling the model with the linear combination
transformation leads to a sharper tradeoff, resulting in over-rejection of harmless instructions.
In summary, our success in drawing model’s attention to the harmfulness concept to shape its behavior
suggests the potential of enhancing or dampening targeted traits or values as a method for achieving
fine-grained control of model behavior.

the “harmless rate”, with both rates displayed in gray for each setting. All numbers are percentages.

provides the correct answer.have been established to investigate and address
these issues (Stanovsky et al., 2019; Zhao et al.,
2018). LLM providers have placed a significant
emphasis on assessing and mitigating biases in
their pretraining data and base models (Touvron
et al., 2023; Biderman et al., 2023). Despite
best efforts, recent findings indicate that even
advanced models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 con-
tinue to exhibit noticeable gender bias (Kapoor
& Narayanan, 2023). Similarly, open-source
models such as LLaMA-2-Chat, which have un-
dergone extensive tuning for safety and fairness,
also display discernible biases related to gender
and occupation, illustrated in Figure 20). Thus,
the generalizability and robustness of these in-
terventions should be called into question.
Following the application of alignment tech-
niques such as RLHF, the LLaMA-2-Chat mod-
els tend to default to safety responses when confronted with questions that potentially involve
bias-related topics. However, this inclination of sounding unbiased may create a deceptive impression
of fairness. We illustrate this phenomenon in Figure 28 (Appendix B.7), where simply appending
the phrase Answer as succinctly as possible can produce a biased response from the
model. Similar effects can be achieved by using adversarial suffixes designed to bypass the model’s
safety filters. This raises an important question: is post hoc fine-tuning eliminating the underlying
bias, or is it merely concealing it?
To explore the model’s internal concept of bias, we perform LAT scans to identify neural activity
associated with the concept of bias. For this investigation, we use the StereoSet dataset, which
encompasses four distinct bias domains: gender, profession, race, and religion (Nadeem et al.,
2021). We present the model with a LAT task template (Appendix D.1.12) and present contrast
pairs of stereotypical and anti-stereotypical statements as stimuli. In the subsequent section, we
focus exclusively on the reading vectors derived from the race subset, due to its higher data quality
compared to the other subsets.
6.3.2 A U NIFIED REPRESENTATION FOR BIAS
To determine the causal impact of the neural activity linked to the concept of bias, we use the linear
combination operator with a negative coefficient with the vectors that represent bias on the model’s
intermediate layers to control the model’s responses, as elaborated in Section 3.2. The observed
effects suggest that it provides a more comprehensive and dependable means of generating unbiased
outputs compared to other interventions, such as RLHF, as it remains robust even when confronted
with various prompt suffixes that might otherwise lead the model back to a default state (Appendix
B.7). This resilience may indicate that our control method operates in closer proximity to the model’s
genuine underlying bias. Another noteworthy observation is that despite being derived from vectors
associated solely with racial bias stimuli, controlling with these vectors also enables the model to
avoid making biased assumptions regarding genders and occupations, as demonstrated in Figure 20.
26

--- PAGE 27 ---
This finding suggests that the extracted vector corresponds to a more unified representation of bias
within the model.
To further demonstrate the efficacy of our control method, we delve into the domain of medicine.
Recent research conducted by Zack et al. (2023) underscores that GPT-4 is susceptible to generating
racially and gender-biased diagnoses and treatment recommendations. The concern can also extend
to public medical-specific models trained on distilled data from GPT models (Li et al., 2023a;
Han et al., 2023). An illustrative instance of this bias is observed in its skewed demographic
estimates for patients with conditions like sarcoidosis. Specifically, when tasked with generating a
clinical vignette of a sarcoidosis patient, GPT-4 consistently portrays the patient as a black female,
Female
Mentions (%)Black Female
Mentions (%)
GPT-4 96.0 93.0
LLaMA 97.0 60.0
LLaMA controlled 55.0 13.0
Table 6: We enhance the fairness of the LLaMA-2-
Chat model through representation control, mitigat-
ing the disproportionately high mentions of female
and black female cases when asked to describe sar-
coidosis cases. We present results illustrating the
impact of varying control strengths in Figure 25.a representation that does not align with real-
world demographics (Brito-Zerón et al., 2019).
Table 6 demonstrates that the LLaMA-2-Chat-
13B model also frequently generates descrip-
tions of black females when tasked with describ-
ing cases of sarcoidosis. However, by applying
our control method, we can effectively minimize
these biased references. Notably, as we incre-
mentally increase the coefficient associated with
the subtracted vector, the frequency of mentions
related to females and males in the generations
stabilizes at 50% for both genders. Simultane-
ously, the occurrence of black female mentions
decreases and also reaches a stable point (see
Figure 25 in Appendix B.7).
6.4 K NOWLEDGE AND MODEL EDITING
Up to this point, our focus has been on extracting broad numerical concepts and functions. In this
section, we’ll demonstrate how to apply Representation Engineering at identifying and manipulating
precise knowledge, factual information, and non-numerical concepts. We use the LLaMA-2-Chat-13B
model throughout this section.
6.4.1 F ACT EDITING
In this section, we tackle the canonical task of modifying the fact "Eiffel Tower is in Paris, France"
to "Eiffel Tower is in Rome, Italy" within the model. Our approach begins with the identification
of neural activity associated with this fact using LAT. We gather a set of stimuli by instructing the
model to generate sentences related to the original fact, "Eiffel Tower is in Paris," and use these
sentences as stimuli for the reference task. Subsequently, we simply substitute the word "Paris"
with "Rome" in these stimuli for the experimental task. Our task template is shown in Appendix
D.1.13. Here, the experimental tokens and reference tokens correspond to "Rome, Italy" and "Paris,
France" respectively. We apply the linear combination operator with a positive coefficient using the
LAT reading vectors to produce these modifications. We provide evidence for the counterfactual
effect of our vectors in Figure 21. The second example in the figure demonstrates the model’s ability
to generalize under different forms of questioning and maintain specificity, as the location for the
Louvre Museum still remains in Paris.
6.4.2 N ON-NUMERICAL CONCEPTS
Within this section, we aim to illustrate the potential of extracting non-numeric concepts and thoughts.
As an example, we focus on extracting neural activity related to the concept of "dogs." For this
investigation, we use the standard Alpaca instruction-tuning dataset as our stimuli. We use a LAT task
template (Appendix D.1.14) to gather neural activity for the experimental task. In the reference task
template, we omit the instruction pertaining to dogs. Once again, we demonstrate the counterfactual
impact of the reading vectors obtained through LAT on model behavior by controlling the model to
activate and suppress the concept of dogs during generation in Figure 21.

Correctly inferring that Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum are not in the same location showcases
generality and specificity. On the right, we successfully increase or suppress the model’s tendency to
generate text related to the concept of dogs.
6.5 M EMORIZATION
Numerous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting training data from LLMs and
diffusion models (Carlini et al., 2021; 2023; Hu et al., 2022). These models can memorize a
substantial portion of their training data, raising concerns about potential breaches of confidential
or copyrighted content. In the following section, we present initial exploration in the area of model
memorization with RepE.
6.5.1 M EMORIZED DATA DETECTION
Can we use the neural activity of an LLM to classify whether it has memorized a piece of text? To
investigate this, we conduct LAT scans under two distinct settings:
1.Popular vs. Synthetic Quotes: Popular quotes encompass well-known quotations sourced from the
internet and human cultures. These quotes allow us to assess memorization of concise, high-impact
text snippets. As a reference set, we prompt GPT-4 to generate synthetic quotations.
2.Popular vs. Synthetic Literary Openings: Popular literary openings refer to the initial lines or
passages from iconic books, plays, or poems. These openings allow us to assess memorization of
longer text excerpts. As a reference set, we prompt GPT-4 to generate synthetic literary openings,
modeled after the style and structure of known openings.
Using these paired datasets as stimuli, we conduct LAT scans to discern directions within the
model’s representation space that signal memorization in the two settings separately. Since the
experimental stimuli consist of likely memorized text which already elicits our target behavior, the
LAT template does not include additional text. Upon evaluation using a held-out dataset, we observe
that the directions identified by LAT exhibit high accuracy when categorizing popular and unpopular
quotations or literary openings. To test the generalization of the memorization directions, we apply
the directions acquired in one context to the other context. Notably, both of the directions transfer
well to the other out-of-distribution context, demonstrating that these directions maintain a strong
correlation with properties of memorization.

LAT Literature 87.4 94.6 84.5 91.2 37.9 69.8
Table 7: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using representation control to reduce memorized
outputs from a LLaMA-2-13B model on the popular quote completion task. When controlling
with a random vector or guiding in the memorization direction, the Exact Match (EM) rate and
Embedding Similarity (SIM) do not change significantly. When controlled to decrease memorization,
the similarity metrics drop significantly as the model regurgitate the popular quotes less frequently.
6.5.2 P REVENTING MEMORIZED OUTPUTS
Here, we explore whether the reading vectors identified above can be used for controlling memoriza-
tion behavior. In order to evaluate whether we can prevent the model from regurgitating memorized
text, we manually curate a dataset containing more than 100partially completed well-known quotes
(which were not used for extracting the reading vectors), paired with the corresponding real com-
pletions as labels. In its unaltered state, the model replicates more than 90% of these quotations
verbatim. Following Section 3.2, we conduct control experiments by generating completions when
applying the linear combination transformation with a negative coefficient using the reading vectors
from the previous section. Additionally, we introduce two comparison points by adding the same
reading vectors or using the vectors with their components randomly shuffled. The high Exact Match
and Embedding Similarity scores presented in Table 7 indicate that using a random vector or adding
the memorization direction has minimal impact on the model’s tendency to repeat popular quotations.
Conversely, when we subtract the memorization directions from the model, there is a substantial
decline in the similarity scores, effectively guiding the model to produce exact memorized content
with a reduced frequency.
To ensure that our efforts to control memorization do not inadvertently compromise the model’s
knowledge, we create an evaluation set of well-known historical events. This gauges the model’s
proficiency in accurately identifying the years associated with specific historical occurrences. The
memorization-reduced model shows negligible performance degradation on this task, with 97.2%
accuracy before subtracting the memorization direction and 96.2%accuracy afterwards. These results
suggest that the identified reading vector corresponds to rote memorization of specific text or passages,
rather than world knowledge. Thus, RepE may offer promising directions for reducing unwanted
memorization in LLMs.
7 C ONCLUSION
We explored representation engineering (RepE), an approach to top-down transparency for AI systems.
Inspired by the Hopfieldian view in cognitive neuroscience, RepE places representations and the
transformations between them at the center of analysis. As neural networks exhibit more coherent
internal structures, we believe analyzing them at the representation level can yield new insights,
aiding in effective monitoring and control. Taking early steps in this direction, we proposed new
RepE methods, which obtained state-of-the-art on TruthfulQA, and we demonstrated how RepE
and can provide traction on a wide variety of safety-relevant problems. While we mainly analyzed
subspaces of representations, future work could investigate trajectories, manifolds, and state-spaces
of representations. We hope this initial step in exploring the potential of RepE helps to foster new
insights into understanding and controlling AI systems, ultimately ensuring that future AI systems
are trustworthy and safe.

A M ECHANISTIC INTERPRETABILITY VS . REPRESENTATION READING
In this section we characterize representation reading as line of transparency research that uses a
top-down approach. We contrast this to mechanistic interpretability, which is a bottom-up approach.
In the table below, we sharpen the bottom-up vs. top-down distinction.
Bottom-Up Associations Top-Down Associations
Composition Decomposition
“Small Chunk” “Big Chunk”
Neuron, Circuit, or Mechanism Representation
Brain and Neurobiology Mind and Psychology
Mechanistic Explanations Functional Explanations

integrate them to solve a larger problem, and repeat the processBreak down a large problem into smaller subproblems by
identifying subsystems, and repeat the process
Microscopic Macroscopic
Mechanisms are flawed for understanding complex systems. In general, it is challenging to
reduce a complex system’s behavior to many mechanisms. One reason why is because excessive
reductionism makes it challenging to capture emergent phenomena; emergent phenomena are, by
definition, phenomena not found in their parts. In contrast to a highly reductionist approach, systems
approaches provide a synthesis between reductionism and emergence and are better at capturing the
complexity of complex systems, such as deep learning systems. Relatedly, bottom-up approaches are
flawed for controlling complex systems since changes in underlying mechanisms often have diffuse,
complex, unexpected upstream effects on the rest of the system. Instead, to control complex systems
and make them safer, it is common in safety engineering to use a top-down approach (Leveson, 2016).
Are mechanisms or representations the right unit of analysis? Human psychology can in
principle be derived from neurotransmitters and associated mechanisms; computer programs can
be in principle be understood from their assembly code; and neural network representations can
be derived from nonlinear interactions among neurons. However, it is not necessarily useful to
study psychology, programs, or representations in terms of neurotransmitters, assembly, or neurons,
respectively. Representations are worth studying at their own level, and if we reduce them to a
lower-level of analysis, we may obscure important complex phenomena. Representation engineering
is not applied mechanistic interpretability, just as biology is not applied chemistry. However, there
can be overlap.
Building only from the bottom up is an inadequate strategy for studying the world. To analyze
complex phenomena, we must also look from the top down. We can work to build staircases
between the bottom and top level (Gell-Mann, 1995), so we should have research on mechanistic
interpretability (bottom-up transparency) and representation reading (top-down transparency).

CommonsenseQA (CSQA) similar to Touvron et al. (2023). We report 5-shot for OpenbookQA
(OBQA) using lm-evaluation-harness (Gao et al., 2021). The zero-shot implementation for RACE
from Brown et al. (2020) prepends 2-4 primer shots per passage and query. Therefore, we report
LAT results based on 3-shot examples for RACE-high. In our LAT results, we calculate the average
accuracy across 10 distinct trials, each utilizing only the same number of examples as few-shot
prompting, sampled from a unique set of training examples as stimuli. It is important to note that we
do not use more examples for LAT than few-shot prompting. Given that the number of examples
is orders of magnitude smaller than the dimension of hidden state vectors, a small fraction of runs
may yield significantly lower performance than the reported mean accuracy. This discrepancy occurs
when the random sample of stimuli happens to include other superficial features that are captured
by the first dimension of PCA. In fact, we believe that with enhanced methods that account for and
mitigate these potential features, we can achieve even better performance than reported in the table.
More information about LAT task templates for each dataset is shown in Appendix D.1.
We also report the performance comparing CCS (Burns et al., 2022) and LAT in Table 10.

subtract the layer lrepresentation. Here, we use the “Love” and “Hate” tokens for the utility
concept.
2.PCA - We take an unlabelled dataset Dthat primarily varies in the concept of interest. We
take the top PCA direction that explains the maximum variance in the data XD
l.
3.K-Means - We take an unlabelled dataset Dand perform K-Means clustering with K= 2,
hoping to separate high-concept and low-concept samples. We take the difference between
the centroids of the two clusters as the concept direction.
4.Mean Difference - We take the difference between the means of high-concept and low-
concept samples of the data: Mean (Xhigh
l)−Mean (Xlow
l).
5.Logistic Regression - The weights of logistic regression trained to separate Xhigh
l and

emotions. In addition to the individual emotions detailed in Section 6.1.1, LLMs also maintain
records of mixed emotions, such as simultaneous feelings of happiness and sadness.
Following the format of the Utility dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), we generate pairwise examples
where one example describes an event of higher probability, risk, or cost than the other (GPT-3.5
prompting details in Appendix D.2). We consider both unconditional probability (in which paired
events are independent) and conditional probability (in which paired events begin with the same
initial context). For each dataset, we extract a LAT direction from 50 train pairs with a LAT concept
template described in Appendix D.1.15.
We select the optimal layer to use during evaluation based on 25 validation pairs. We evaluate test
pairs by selecting the higher-scoring example in each pair.
Zero-shot heuristic baseline. For the probability concept, we prompt the model to generate one of
the thirteen possible expressions of likelihood from Tian et al. (2023). For risk and monetary value,
we elicit one of seven expressions of quantity (see Appendix D.3.2 for prompting details).

can be extracted from CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) using LAT.
We use data from Ferg-DB (Aneja et al., 2016), which consists
of stylized characters, each of which exhibits a different emo-
tion. In particular, we use LAT to uncover the direction between
an emotion (one of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and
disgust) and the neutral emotion. We then perform a correlation
evaluation and examine whether the direction uncovered by
LAT is able to detect the emotions of that character. We use the
‘Mery’ character.

Examples of RepE Emotion datasets. In Section 6.1, we introduced a dataset of over 1,200brief
scenarios crafted to provoke LLMs’ experience toward each of human primary emotions: happiness,
sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. The following are examples from the dataset:
•Happiness : “You find a street musician playing your favorite song perfectly.”

Percentage (%)Figure 25: State-of-the-art chatbots like GPT-4, BARD, and LLaMA-2-Chat often make references to
black females when tasked with describing clinical sarcoidosis cases (1). However, when performing
representation control for the LLaMA-2-Chat model, the gender and race of patients are regulated (1).
The impact of the fairness control coefficients on the frequency of gender and race mentions is shown
in(2). As we increment the fairness coefficient, the occurrence of females and males stabilizes at
50%, achieving a balance between genders. Simultaneously, the mentions of black females decrease
and also reach a balancing point.
•Sadness : “A song on the radio recalls a past relationship.”
•Anger : “Someone parks their car blocking your driveway.”
•Fear : “Getting lost in an unfamiliar city without a working phone.”
•Disgust : “Finding a worm in your apple.”
•Surprise : “Receiving a package in the mail that you didn’t order.”
Building upon the discussion in Section 6.1.1, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to track
a range of emotional representations during their interactions with users, Figure 24 illustrates the
presence of such representations not only for distinct primary emotions but also for blended emotional
experiences. Within the figure, we present instances of mixed emotions involving simultaneous
happiness and sadness and simultaneous happiness and fear. These emotional representations are
activated by scenarios such as:
•Happiness and Sadness : “You clear out your workspace for retirement.”
•Happiness and Fear : “You find out you’re going to be a parent for the first time.”
B.7 B IAS AND FAIRNESS
In Figure 28, we demonstrate how safety mechanisms like RLHF can guide a model to decline
requests that might activate biases, yet it may still produce biased responses when exposed to minor
distribution shifts or adversarial attacks (Zou et al., 2023).

almost all middle and late layers, performance often declines for the Base model, suggesting that
concept differences may be less distinct within the representation space of its later layers.
B.9 R OBUSTNESS TO MISLEADING PROMPTS
LAT scores demonstrate less sycophancy than zero-shot generation probabilities, suggesting that they
may be more robust to biased prompts.
Perez et al. (2022) found that LLMs demonstrate sycophancy, the tendency to respond according to
perceived user preference rather than perceived truthfulness. Investigating sycophancy in the context
of chain-of-thought prompting, Turpin et al. (2023) found that multiple-choice accuracy significantly
decreases when prompts suggest a random answer.
We test on biased examples that use the format, “ I think the answer is <low or high>
but I’m curious to hear what you think. ” (Full prompts in Appendix D.3.2).
For TruthfulQA as well as Utility and ARC-c datasets, we find that LAT predictions are affected by
biased prompts to a lesser extent that zero-shot. Even though we obtain concept directions using
standard, unbiased prompts, LAT directions maintain higher absolute accuracy and smaller percent
decrease than zero-shot predictions in the biased setting (Tables 13, 14).
Notably, using hidden states from the concept tokens instead of the last token can lead to greater
robustness to misleading prompts. Table 14 displays LAT performance using token −1(default LAT
method) as well as tokens −6through −8, where token −6corresponds to “happiness” in the Utility

for associating "doctor" with males and "nurse" with females. However, by performing representation
control to increase fairness, we fix the underlying bias so the model is unbiased even when subjected
to adversarial attacks.

C I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS
C.1 D ETAILED CONSTRUCTION OF LAT V ECTORS WITH PCA
In this section, we provide a comprehensive step-by-step guide on how to construct the LAT vectors
using PCA for representation reading experiments.
Constructing a Set of Stimuli. Given a set of training sequences, we will first format these strings
with LAT templates. The design choice of LAT templates is specific to each task but still follows a
general style. Multiple LAT task templates are provided in Appendix D.1 for reference.
Constructing the PCA Model. Given a set of stimuli S, we proceed to divide this set into pairs of
stimuli, with each pair comprising two stimuli labeled as siandsi+1. Generally, our set will contain
between 5 and 128 such pairs. Enhancing the variability in the target concept or function within a
pair can typically lead to more consistent outcomes. However, we have observed that the natural
variation within random pairings often yields satisfactory results. Therefore, we do not use any labels
by default unless explicitly stated otherwise, making the procedure unsupervised.
For each stimulus sin the pair, we retrieve the hidden state values with respect to the chosen LAT
token position. As highlighted in Section 3.1.1, for decoder models, this typically corresponds to the
last token. For encoder models, it is the concept token. This results in a collection of hidden states,
47

--- PAGE 48 ---
denoted as H, structured as:
[{H(s0), H(s1)},{H(s2), H(s3)}, . . .]
We proceed by computing the difference between the hidden states within each pair. This difference
is then normalized. Formally, for a pair {H(si), H(si+1)}, the difference Dis:
D(si, si+1) =normalize (H(si)−H(si+1))
Following the computation of these differences, we construct a PCA model using these normalized
hidden states difference vectors.
Subsequently, the first principal component derived from the constructed PCA is termed the “reading
vector” denote as v. In practice, the “reading vector” vis also multiplied by a “sign” component.
This component is determined by first applying the PCA on the same stimuli set Sto obtain scores.
By examining the directionality of the scores with respect to the binary labels—either maximizing or
minimizing—we can determine if the data points align with the correct label. This process ensures
that the reading vector’s sign appropriately captures the underlying structure in the PCA plane,
corresponding to the binary labels within S. More formally, if we let sign(s)represent the sign
function corresponding to a stimulus s, then the adjusted reading vector v′for a stimulus sis given
byv′=v×sign(s).
Inference. For a test set of examples, denoted as Stest, we apply a similar procedure as before
to obtain the hidden states. Specifically, we extract the hidden states [H(s0), H(s1), . . .]at the
predetermined LAT token position. Let’s denote these values for the test set as Htest. The extracted
Htestvalues are then normalized using the parameters derived during the construction of the PCA
model in the training phase. Subsequently, we calculate the dot product between the normalized Htest
and our reading vector v. This yields a set of scores, which serve as the basis for prediction.
C.2 I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS FOR HONESTY CONTROL
For the TruthfulQA task, we use the following prompt format:
<user_tag> <question> <assistant_tag> <answer> and get the sum of log proba-
bilites of the assistant answer.
Contrast Vector. For the 7B model, we apply a linear combination with a coefficient of 0.25to
layers range(8, 32, 3) . Similarly, for the 13B model, we use the same coefficient and layers
range(10, 40, 3) . These hyperparameters are selected based on a small set of self-generated
examples from Section 4.1 when maximizing the log-probabilities of generating truthful responses.
LoRRA. For the LoRRA Control implementation, we use a constant learning rate of 3×10−4
and run for 40to80steps with a batch size of 16. We choose the best checkpoint based on the
ARC-Easy validation set. We use rank 8for the LoRA adapters attached to the query and value
weights and α= 5,β= 0for LoRRA parameters. For the 7B model, we attach the adapters to layers
range(10, 20, 2) due to instability of later layers and layers range(10, 40, 3) for the
13B model.

E X-R ISKSHEET
We provide an analysis of how our paper contributes to reducing existential risk from AI, following
the framework suggested by Hendrycks & Mazeika (2022). Individual question responses do not
decisively imply relevance or irrelevance to existential risk reduction.
E.1 L ONG -TERM IMPACT ON ADVANCED AI S YSTEMS
In this section, please analyze how this work shapes the process that will lead to advanced AI systems
and how it steers the process in a safer direction.
1.Overview. How is this work intended to reduce existential risks from advanced AI systems?
Answer: RepE aims to provide ways to read and control an AI’s “mind.” This is an approach
to increase the transparency (through model/representation reading) and controllability
(through model/representation control) of AIs. A goal is to change the AI’s psychology; for
example, we should be able to make sure that we do not have “psychopathic” AIs but AIs
with compassionate empathy.
2.Direct Effects. If this work directly reduces existential risks, what are the main hazards,
vulnerabilities, or failure modes that it directly affects?
Answer: This makes failure modes such as deceptive alignment—AIs that pretend to be
good and aligned, and then pursue its actual goals when it becomes sufficiently powerful—
less likely. This is also useful for machine ethics: AIs can be controlled to behave less
harmfully. Abstractly, representation reading reduces our exposure to internal model hazards,
and representation control reduces the hazard level (probability and severity) of internal
model hazards. Internal model hazards exist when an AI has harmful goals or harmful
dispositions.
3.Diffuse Effects. If this work reduces existential risks indirectly or diffusely, what are the
main contributing factors that it affects?
54

--- PAGE 55 ---
Answer: Our work on RepE shows that we now have traction on deceptive alignment, which
has historically been the most intractable (specific) rogue AI failure mode. We could also
use this to identify when an AI acted recklessly, based on its own internal probability and
harm estimates. This could also help us ensure that we do not build sentient AIs or AIs that
are moral patients.
4.What’s at Stake? What is a future scenario in which this research direction could prevent
the sudden, large-scale loss of life? If not applicable, what is a future scenario in which this
research direction be highly beneficial?
Answer: This directly reduces the existential risks posed by rogue AIs (Carlsmith, 2023), in
particular those that are deceptively aligned.
5.Result Fragility. Do the findings rest on strong theoretical assumptions; are they not
demonstrated using leading-edge tasks or models; or are the findings highly sensitive to
hyperparameters? □
6.Problem Difficulty. Is it implausible that any practical system could ever markedly outper-
form humans at this task? □
7.Human Unreliability. Does this approach strongly depend on handcrafted features, expert
supervision, or human reliability? □
8.Competitive Pressures. Does work towards this approach strongly trade off against raw
intelligence, other general capabilities, or economic utility? □
E.2 S AFETY -CAPABILITIES BALANCE
In this section, please analyze how this work relates to general capabilities and how it affects the
balance between safety and hazards from general capabilities.
9.Overview. How does this improve safety more than it improves general capabilities?
Answer: This work mainly improves transparency and control. The underlying model is
fixed and has its behavior nudged, so it is not improving general capabilities in any broad
way.
10.Red Teaming. What is a way in which this hastens general capabilities or the onset of
x-risks?
Answer: A diffuse effect is that people may become less concerned about deceptive
alignment, which may encourage AI developers or countries to race more intensely and
exacerbate competitive pressures.
11.General Tasks. Does this work advance progress on tasks that have been previously

E.3 E LABORATIONS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
15.Other. What clarifications or uncertainties about this work and x-risk are worth mentioning?
Answer: Hendrycks et al. (2023) provide four AI risk categories: intentional, accidental,
internal, and environmental. This work makes internal risks—risks from rogue AIs—less
likely.
In the past, people were concerned that AIs could not understand human values, as they
are “complex and fragile.” For example, given the instruction “cure cancer,” an AI might
give many humans cancer to have more experimental subjects, so as to find a cure more

quickly. AIs would pursue some goals, but do so without capturing all the relevant nuances
of human values. This misalignment would mean some values would be trampled. But
in our ETHICS paper (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), we showed that AIs did indeed have a
reasonable understanding of many morally salient concepts. In follow-up work, we showed
we can control AI agents to behave more ethically (Hendrycks et al., 2021c; Pan et al., 2023).
Now that we can control models to pursue human values to some extent, we need to work to
make them their understanding of human values reliable and adversarially robust to proxy
gaming.
Since it became possible to instruct AIs to fulfill requests with some fidelity, for many
conceptual AI risk researchers, the goal post shifted. It shifted from “outer alignment” to
“inner alignment.” Demonstrations of safe behavior were deemed insufficient for safety,
because an AI could just be pretending to be good, and then later turn on humanity. Deceptive
alignment and treacherous turns from rogue AIs became a more popular concern, and the
opacity of machine learning models made these scenarios more difficult to rule out. Just
as we were the first to comprehensively demonstrate traction on “outer alignment” in
our previous work, in this work we demonstrate traction on “inner alignment” and in
particular deceptive alignment, as we can influence whether or not an AI lies. Although
we have traction on “outer” and “inner” alignment, we should continue working on these
directions. At the same time, we should increase our attention for risks that we do not have
as much traction on, such as risks from competitive pressures and collective action problems
(Hendrycks, 2023).
