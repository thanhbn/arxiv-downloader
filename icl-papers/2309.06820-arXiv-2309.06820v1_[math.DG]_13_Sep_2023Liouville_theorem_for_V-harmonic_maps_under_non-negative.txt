arXiv:2309.06820v1  [math.DG]  13 Sep 2023Liouville theorem for V-harmonic maps under non-negative
(m,V)-Ricci curvature for non-positive m
Kazuhiro Kuwae∗, Songzi Li†, Xiang-Dong Li‡and Yohei Sakurai§
Abstract
LetVbe aC1-vector ﬁeld on an n-dimensional complete Riemannian mani-
fold(M,g). We prove a Liouville theorem for V-harmonic maps satisfying various
growth conditions from complete Riemannian manifolds with non-negative (m,V)-
Ricci curvature for m∈[−∞,0]∪[n,+∞]into Cartan-Hadamard manifolds,
which extends Cheng’s Liouville theorem proved in [11] for s ublinear growth har-
monic maps from complete Riemannian manifolds with non-neg ative Ricci curvature
into Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. We also prove a Liouville t heorem for V-harmonic
maps from complete Riemannian manifolds with non-negative (m,V)-Ricci curva-
ture form∈[−∞,0]∪[n,+∞]into regular geodesic balls of Riemannian man-
ifolds with positive upper sectional curvature bound, whic h extends the results of
Hildebrandt-Jost-Wideman [17] and Choi [12]. Our probabil istic proof of Liouville
theorem for several growth V-harmonic maps into Hadamard manifolds enhances
an incomplete argument in [59]. Our results extend the resul ts due to Chen-Jost-
Qiu [9] and Qiu [53] in the case of m= +∞on the Liouville theorem for bounded
V-harmonic maps from complete Riemannian manifolds with non -negative (∞,V)-
Ricci curvature into regular geodesic balls of Riemannian m anifolds with positive
sectional curvature upper bound. Finally, we establish a co nnection between the
Liouville property of V-harmonic maps and the recurrence property of ∆V-diﬀusion
processes on manifolds. Our results are new even in the case V=∇fforf∈C2(M).
Keywords :(m,V)-Ricci curvature, V-Laplacian, ∆V-diﬀusion process, radial process,
sublinear growth, V-harmonic function, V-harmonic maps.

1 Statement of Main Theorem
Let(M,g,f)denote an n-dimensional weighted Riemannian manifold, namely, (M,g)is
ann-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold, and f∈C∞(M). Letd:=dgdenote
the Riemannian distance and let Br(p) :={x∈M|d(p,x)< r}denote the open ball
with center p∈Mand radius r >0. Throughout this paper, we always assume n≥2.
Let∆f:= ∆−/a\}b∇acketle{t∇f,∇·/a\}b∇acket∇i}htbe a diﬀusion operator called f-Laplacian orWitten Laplacian ,
which is symmetric with respect to the measure µ(dx) :=e−f(x)νg(dx), whereνgis the
volume measure of (M,g). Form∈[−∞,+∞], them-weighted Ricci curvature for
(M,g,f)or∆fis deﬁned as following ([3], [38], [34]):
Ricm
f:= Ric g+Hessf−df⊗df
m−n,
where when m=±∞, the last term is interpreted as the limit 0, and when m=n, we
only consider a constant function f, and set Ricn
f:= Ric g.
Under the classical curvature condition
Ricm
f≥Kg
forK∈Randm∈[n,+∞], comparison geometry has been developed by many authors
(see e.g. [3], [4], [13], [14], [34], [40], [51], [52], [62], and references therein). In this
case, the parameter mis interpreted as an upper bound for dimension n. In recent
years, comparison geometry for the complementary case of m∈]−∞,n[has begun to be
investigated (see e.g., [28], [29], [30], [39], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [49], [55], [63], [64]). In
these papers, mis considered as a parameter less than 1or non-positive, and it is called
eﬀective dimension . In this case, mmight not seem an upper bound for dimension nif
we keep the usual order for real line R. In view of the coincidence Ric∞
V= Ric−∞
V, if we
change the order like n≤m1≤+∞“=”−∞ ≤m2≤1, then the parameter m2can be
understood as an upper bound for the dimension n. Wylie-Yeroshkin [64] introduced a
curvature condition.

In [60], Yau developed the method of gradient estimate and pr oved the strong or
bounded Liouville theorem on complete Riemannian manifold s. More precisely, let (M,g)
be a complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature boun ded from below by −K,
i.e.,Ricg≥ −Kg, whereK≥0is a constant, and ube a harmonic function (i.e. a
2

solution to ∆u= 0) which is bounded from below, then the following gradient es timate
holds
|∇u| ≤/radicalbig
(n−1)K/parenleftBig
u−inf
Mu/parenrightBig
. (1.1)
TakingK= 0, the gradient estimate (1.1) implies the strong or bounded L iouville theo-
rem, namely, every non-negative or bounded harmonic functi on on a complete Riemannian
manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature must be constan t. In [34], the third named
author extended Yau’s gradient estimate to f-harmonic functions, namely, let (M,g,f)
be a complete Riemannian manifold with Ricm
f≥ −Kg, whereK≥0andm∈[n,+∞[
are two constants, and ube a solution to ∆fu= 0which is bounded from below, then
|∇u| ≤/radicalbig
(m−1)K/parenleftBig
u−inf
Mu/parenrightBig
. (1.2)
TakingK= 0, the gradient estimate (1.2) implies an extension of Yau’s s trong or bounded
Liouville theorem, namely, every non-negative or bounded ∆f-harmonic function on a
complete Riemannian manifold with non-negative m-dimensional Bakry-Emery Ricci cur-
vature (i.e., Ricm
f≥0) must be constant.
In the case m= +∞, Brighton [7] proved the following Liouville Theorem for bo unded
∆f-harmonic functions as a corollary of gradient estimate for ∆f-harmonic functions under
non-negative lower bounds of Ric∞
f.
Theorem 1.1 ([7, Corollary 2]) .Suppose Ric∞
f≥0. Ifuis a bounded ∆f-harmonic
function, then uis constant.
Theorem 1.1 can be derived from the Hamilton type Harnack ine quality. In [35],
the third named author proved the Hamilton type dimension fr ee Harnack inequality for
bounded positive solutions to the heat equation of ∆f. More precisely, let ube a positive
solution to the heat equation ∂tu= ∆fuwithu≤Afor some constant A >0. Suppose
thatRic∞
f≥ −Kgfor some constant K≥0. Then the following Harnack inequality holds
|∇logu|2≤2K
1−e−2Ktlog(A/u), (1.3)
which improves Hamilton type dimension free Harnack inequa lity for bounded positive
solutions to the heat equation of ∆f, i.e.,
|∇logu|2≤/parenleftbigg1
t+K/parenrightbigg
log(A/u). (1.4)
In particular, when K= 0, and letting t→ ∞, we can derived that all bounded ∆f-
harmonic functions must be constant. That is to say, we can re capture Brighton’s result
from Harnack inequalities (1.3)and(1.4)for the heat equation of ∆f. In [31], the second
and third named authors proved the Li-Yau-Hamilton type Har nack inequality for positive
solutions to the heat equation ∂tu= ∆fuon complete Riemannian manifolds with Ricm
f≥
−(m−1)Kgwithm∈[n,+∞[. In [32], the second and third named authors proved (1.3)
for bounded positive solutions to the heat equation ∂tu= ∆fuon complete (K,∞)-super

Ricci ﬂow. See also [32, 33] for the Li-Yau type and the Li-Yau -Hamilton type Harnack
inequalities for positive solution to the heat equation ∂tu= ∆fuon Ricci ﬂow and variant
of super Ricci ﬂows. Note that Hua [19] also provided another proof of Theorem 1.1.
On the other hand, S. Y. Cheng [11] generalized Yau’s gradien t estimate to harmonic
maps. Recall that a smooth map u:M→Nbetween two Riemannian manifolds (M,g)
and(N,g)is said to be a harmonic map ifτ(u) = 0, whereτ(u)is the tension ﬁeld of u
anddu:TM→TNdeﬁned by (du)x:TxM→Tu(x)Nis the diﬀerential of u, see Section
3below or [56] and related references.
Theorem 1.2 ([11, Theorem]) .Let(M,g)be a complete Riemannian manifold with
Ricg≥ −Kg,K≥0, andNa Cartan-Hadamard manifold, i.e., a complete connected
and simply connected Riemannian manifold having non-posit ive sectional curvature. Let
u:M→Nbe a harmonic map. Assume u(Ba(p))⊂Bb(o)for some p∈Mando∈N
and some a,b >0. Then we have

whereCnis a constant depending only on nandβ=b2−supBa(p)d2
N(u,o). HeredN
denotes the Riemannian distance of (N,h).
As a corollary, S. Y. Cheng [11] established a Liouville theo rem for sublinear growth
harmonic maps:
Corollary 1.3 ([11, Liouville theorem for harmonic maps]) .Let(M,g)be a complete
Riemannian manifold with Ricg≥0, andNa Cartan-Hadamard manifold, i.e., a com-
plete connected and simply connected Riemannian manifold h aving non-positive sectional
curvature. Let u:M→Nbe a harmonic map. If usatisﬁes the sublinear growth

for some p∈Mando∈N. Thenuis a constant map.
Hildbrandt-Jost-Widemann [17] and Choi [12] further exten ded Cheng’s work [11] as
the following theorem:
Theorem 1.4 (cf. [12, (11)]) .Let(M,g)be a complete smooth Riemannian manifold with
Ricg≥ −Kg,K≥0, andNa complete smooth Riemannian manifold having sectional
curvature SectN≤κ,κ >0. Letu:M→Nbe a harmonic map. Assume u(M)⊂Bb(o)

A geodesic ball BR(o)⊂NwithSectN≤κis said to be a regular geodesic ball if
BR(o)∩Cut(o) =∅andR < π/2√
κ+withκ+:= max{κ,0}.
Corollary 1.5 ([12, Theorem]) .Let(M,g)be a complete Riemannian manifold with
Ricg≥0, andNa complete Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature SectN≤κ,
κ >0. Letu:M→Nbe a harmonic map whose range is contained in a regular geodes ic
ballBb(o). Thenuis a constant map.
The purpose of this paper is to extend Cheng’s Liouville theo rem for sublinear growth
V-harmonic maps u:M→Nbetween Riemannian manifolds (M,g)and(N,h)under the
relaxed condition Ricm
V≥0form∈[−∞,0]∪[n,+∞]and(N,h)is a Cartan-Hadamard
manifold, and to extend Hildbrandt-Jost-Widemann and Choi ’s Liouville theorem for V-
harmonic maps u:M→Nbetween Riemannian manifolds (M,g)and(N,h)under
reasonable condition. Here, not only for the symmetric diﬀu sion operator ∆f, we work
on the more general setting of a Riemannian manifold (M,g,V)with aC1-vector ﬁeld
Vwhich is not necessarily to be the gradient V=∇ffor some f∈C2(M). Such
a Riemannian manifold is equipped with canonical V-Laplacian and V-Ricci curvature.
More precisely, the non-symmetric V-Laplacian is deﬁned by
∆V:= ∆−/a\}b∇acketle{tV,∇·/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
and the m-dimensional V-Ricci curvature , or the (m,V)-Ricci curvature , is deﬁned as
follows:
Ricm
V:= Ric g+1

wherem∈[−∞,+∞]and setV= 0underm=n,LVg(X,Y) :=/a\}b∇acketle{t∇XV,Y/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht+/a\}b∇acketle{t∇YV,X/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
is the Lie derivative of gwith respect to V, andV∗denotes its dual 1-form. We would like
to point out that, in the case where m∈[n,+∞[,Ricm
Vhas been introduced in previous
works of Qian [52] and Bakry-Qian [4]. In [34] (Section 8.7, p . 1347), for V=−B, the
third named author used the notation RicS
m,n(L) = Ric g−∇SB−B⊗B
m−n(instead of Ricm
V)
to denote the m-dimensional Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature for non-symmetr ic elliptic
diﬀusion operator L= ∆+B, where∇SB(ξ,η) =1
2{/a\}b∇acketle{t∇ξB,η/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht+/a\}b∇acketle{t∇ηB,ξ/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht}. Moreover, it
has been pointed out in [34] that it would be very possible to e xtend the various Liouville
theorems and Harnack inequalities to non-symmetric diﬀusi on operators. Indeed, as the
Laplacian comparison theorem holds for L= ∆+Bunder the condition RicS
m,n(L)≥Kg
forK∈Randm∈[n,+∞[, see Bakry-Qian [4], the proofs of the strong Liouville
theorem and the Li-Yau Harnack inequality for symmetric ell iptic diﬀusion operators in
[34] can be extended to non-symmetric diﬀusion operators. F or the detail, see [36].
In the case of V=∇f, it coincides with Ricm
f. Form1∈]−∞,1]andm2∈[n,+∞[
we have the following order
Ric1
V≥Ricm1
V≥Ric−∞
V= Ric∞
V≥Ricm2
V. (1.7)
So the condition Ricm
V≥Kgis weaker than Ric∞
V≥Kgform∈]−∞,1]andK∈R.
We now describe more detail of our setting. Let (M,g)and(N,h)be two complete
smooth Riemaniann manifolds. A smooth map u:M→Nis said to be V-harmonic if
5

--- PAGE 6 ---
τV(u) :=τ(u)−(du)(V) = 0. When V=∇fforf∈C2(M), anyV-harmonic map is
called the f-harmonic map . The notion of V-harmonic map covers the various notions
of harmonicity for maps, e.g., Hermitian harmonic maps, Wey l harmonic maps and aﬃne
harmonic maps (see [10] for these notions on harmonicity). I n [9, Theorem 2], Chen-
Jost-Qiu proved the bounded Liouville property for V-harmonic maps from complete
Riemannian manifolds with Ric∞
V≥0into regular geodesic ball with SectN≤κforκ≥0
under the sublinear growth condition for V. Later, Qiu [53, Theorem 2] also proved the
bounded Liouville property as in [9, Theorem 2] without assu ming the sublinear growth
condition for V. We will prove not only the bounded Liouville property for V-harmonic
maps from complete Riemannian manifolds into regular geode sic ball but also Liouville
property for sublinear growth V-harmonic map into Cartan-Hadamard manifold (N,h)
underRicm
V≥0withm∈[−∞,0]∪[n,+∞].
Hereafter, we always ﬁx points p∈Mando∈N, and also m∈[−∞,0]∪[n,+∞[.
Deﬁnition 1.6. A mapu:M→Nis said to be of sublinear growth if
lim
a→∞mu(a)/a= 0,
for some/any o∈N, wheremu(a) := supx∈Ba(p)dN(u(x),o), i.e.,mu(a) =o(a) (a→ ∞).
We prepare several growth conditions for a smooth map u:M→N:
(G1)uis of sublinear growth, i.e., mu(a) =o(a),(a→ ∞).
(G2)mu(a) =o(√a),(a→ ∞).
(G3)mu(a) =o(√loga),(a→ ∞).
It is easy to see that (G1) (resp.(G2)) is weaker than (G2) (resp.(G3)). Note here
that any bounded map u:M→Nsatisﬁes (G3), i.e., the boundedness of uis stronger
than any (Gi).
Fix a point p∈M. We set v(r) := supx∈Br(p)|V|xforr >0andv(0) :=|V|p. Then
vis a non-negative continuous function on [0,+∞[and|V|x≤v(rp(x))holds for x∈M.
Hererp(x) :=d(x,p)is the radial function from a referene point p∈M. Now we consider
the following conditions:
(A1)v∈L1([0,+∞[), or/a\}b∇acketle{tV,˙γt/a\}b∇acket∇i}htγt≥0a.e.tholds for any unit speed geodesic γstarting
fromp;
(A2) There exists D≥1such that/integraltextr
0v(s)ds≤n−m
4logD(1+r);
(A3) There exists D≥1such that/integraltextr
0v(s)ds≤n−m
4logD(1+r2).
The condition (A2) (resp.(A3)) withD= 1is satisﬁed if v(r)≤n−m
4(1+r)(resp.v(r)≤
(n−m)r
2(1+r2)) forr≥0.
Our ﬁrst main result extends Cheng’s Liouville theorem to su blinear growth V-harmonic
maps on manifolds with Ricm
V≥0andSectN≤0.

--- PAGE 7 ---
Theorem 1.7. Let(M,g,V)be a complete Riemaniann manifold with Ricm
V≥0for some
C1-vector ﬁeld Vand some constant m∈[−∞,0]∪[n,+∞], and(N,h)is a Cartan-
Hadamard manifold, i.e., Nis a complete connected and simply connected Riemannian
manifold with SectN≤0. Letu:M→Nbe aV-harmonic map. For each i= 1,2,3, we
suppose (Ai)forp∈Mand(Gi)foruprovided m∈[−∞,0]∪ {+∞}, otherwise, we
only suppose (G1). Thenuis a constant map.
For each i= 1,2,3, we consider the following condition (Bi)on the shape of Laplacian
comparison.
(Bi)There exists D≥1such that rp(x)∆Vrp(x)≤D(1+rp(x)i−1)forx /∈Cut(p).
Note here that the radial function x/ma√sto→rp(x)is secondly diﬀerentiable at x /∈Cut(p). The
condition (Ai)implies (Bi)for eachi= 1,2,3(see Theorem 2.3 below).
Remark 1.8. The statement of Theorem 1.7 remains valid by replacing (Ai)with(Bi)
for eachi= 1,2,3(see the proof of Theorem 2.3).
Our second main result extends Hildbrandt-Jost-Widemann a nd Choi’s Liouville the-
orem as follows:
Theorem 1.9. Let(M,g,V)be a complete Riemaniann manifold with Ricm
V≥0for some
C1-vector ﬁeld Vand some constant m∈[−∞,0]∪[n,+∞], andNbe a complete
Riemannian manifold with SectN≤κwithκ >0. Suppose (A3) forp∈Mwhen
m∈[−∞,0]∪ {+∞}. Letu:M→Nbe aV-harmonic map whose range is contained
in a regular geodesic ball BR(o). Thenuis a constant map.
Corollary 1.10 (Chen-Jost-Qiu [9, Theorem 2] and Qiu [53, Theorem 2]) .
Let(M,g,V)be a complete Riemaniann manifold with Ric∞
V≥0for some C1-vector ﬁeld
V, andNbe a complete Riemannian manifold with SectN≤κwithκ >0. Letu:M→N
be aV-harmonic map whose range is contained in a regular geodesic ballBR(o). Thenu
is a constant map.
Corollary 1.11. Let(M,g,V)be a complete Riemaniann manifold with Ricm
V≥0for
someC1-vector ﬁeld Vand some constant m∈]−∞,0]∪[n,+∞[, andNbe a complete
Riemannian manifold with SectN≤κwithκ >0. Suppose that Vis bounded. Let
u:M→Nbe aV-harmonic map whose range is contained in a regular geodesic ball
BR(o). Thenuis a constant map.
We now discuss the connection between the Liouville propert y of harmonic maps and
the recurrence property of diﬀusion processes on manifolds . In the case of harmonic
functions, it is well-known that all bounded subharmonic fu nctions must be constant if
and only if the Brownian motion on manifold is recurrent. Thi s remains true for general
V-subharmonic functions and the ∆V-diﬀusion process on manifolds. To help the reader
who is not familiar in this result, let us recall some notions and facts in potential theory.
LetXV= (Ω,Xt,Px)be the∆V-diﬀusion process associated to the V-Laplacian ∆Vand
ζ:= inf{t >0|Xt/∈M}its life time (see Section 3 below). A Borel function gonM
is said to be excessive ifgis non-negative on MandEx[g(Xt) :t < ζ]≤g(x)for any
t >0andlimt→0Ex[g(Xt) :t < ζ] =g(x)andx∈M.XVis said to be recurrent if any
excessive function is constant (see [16, (2.4) Proposition ]). Our third main result is the
following:
7

--- PAGE 8 ---
Theorem 1.12. Let(M,g),(N,h)be two complete Riemannian manifolds. Suppose that
the∆V-diﬀusion process XVis recurrent and SectN≤κwithκ >0. Letu:M→Nbe
aV-harmonic map whose range is contained in a regular geodesic ballBR(o). Thenuis
a constant map.
Remark 1.13. We give the following remark.
(i) As far as we know, Theorem 1.7, Theorem 1.9 and Theorem 1.1 2 are new in the
literature, even in the symmetric case V=∇ffor some f∈C2(M).
(ii) Under Ricm
V≥0, the condition (A3) implies (B3) (see Theorem 2.3). Moreover,
the statement of Theorem 1.9 remains valid by replacing (A3) with(B3), because
Theorem 1.9 is based on Theorem 1.7.
(iii) The assertion of Theorem 1.12 under V= 0is well-known. Indeed, if the Brownian
motionXVis recurrent, then every bounded harmonic function is const ant. So
the bounded Liouville property into regular geodesic balls of Riemannian manifolds
having positive upper sectional curvature bounds holds by K endall [22, 23, 24].
(iv) Theorem 1.12 is an extension of [9, Theorem 5], which sta tes that if (M,g)is a com-
pact Riemannian manifold without boundary and (N,h)is a complete Riemannian
manifold with sectional curvature bounded above by a positi ve constant κ, then
everyV-harmonic map u:M→Nwith range in a regular ball must be a constant
map. We would like to point out that the requirement of the com pactness of M
is indeed for the validity of the following strong maximum pr inciple: If a smooth
∆V-harmonic function uattains a maximum u(x0)atx0∈M, thenu≡u(x0).
This is nothing but the bounded Liouville property for ∆V-harmonic functions.
The proof of Theorem 1.9 shows that the bounded Liouville pro perty holds for ∆V-
harmonic functions on complete Riemannian manifolds with r ecurrent ∆V-diﬀusion
process. In view of this, Theorem 1.12 gives the connection b etween the bounded
Liouville property for V-harmonic maps with range in regular geodesic ball of com-
plete Riemannian manifolds with positive upper sectional c urvature bounds and
the recurrence property of ∆V-diﬀusion process on the complete source Riemannian
manifolds.
As a corollary of Theorem 1.12, the recurrence of ∆f-diﬀusion process on complete
Riemannian surface proved in [28, Theorem 2.6] under the low er boundedness of fand
Ric1
f≥0leads us to the following:
Corollary 1.14. Let(M,g)be a complete Riemannian surface with a lower bounded func-
tionf∈C2(M), and(N,h)a complete smooth Riemannian manifold. Assume Ric1
f≥0
andSectN≤κwithκ >0. Letu:M→Nbe anf-harmonic map whose range is
contained in a regular geodesic ball BR(o). Thenuis a constant map.
Example 1.15. LetM=Rnbe ann-dimensional Euclidean space. Consider a smooth
lower bounded function f(x) := (n−m)log(n−m+|x|2)form∈]−∞,1]. Then we see
8

that forx,v∈Rn,
Ric∞
f(v,v)(x) =2(n−m)
(n−m+|x|2)2/parenleftbig
(n−m+|x|2)|v|2−/a\}b∇acketle{tx,v/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht2/parenrightbig

(n−m+|x|2)2/parenleftbig
(n−m+|x|2)|v|2−/a\}b∇acketle{tx,v/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht2/parenrightbig
≥0.
Whenf(x) :=nlog(n+|x|2), thenRic0
f(v,v)(x)≥0, hence one can apply Theorem 1.7 for
anyf-harmonic maps having (G1) condition into Hadamard manifolds. In this case, the
condition (A1)∗below holds, because fis radially increasing and rotationally symmetric
around0. Since (A1)∗implies (A3)∗, hence(B3)holds (see the prof of Theorem 2.3
below), Theorem 1.9 can be applied.
Example 1.16. LetM=Rnbe ann-dimensional Euclidean space. Consider a smooth
lower bounded function f(x) := (n−1)log(n−1+|x|2). Then we see that for x,v∈Rn

Then by [28, Theorem 2.6], the ∆f-diﬀusion process is recurrent under the lower bound-
edness of f,n= 2andRic1
f≥0. In this case, any f-harmonic map into regular geodesic
ball in a complete Riemannian manifold (N,h)withSectN≤κ(κ >0) is a constant map
by Theorem 1.12.
WhenN=R, Theorem 1.7 extends Theorem 1.1, because of the order Ricm
V≥Ric∞
V
form∈]−∞,0]. Moreover, it extends the classical S. Y. Cheng’s Liouville Theorem [11]
for sublinear growth harmonic maps between Riemannian mani folds. Indeed, based on the
Laplacian comparison theorem due to Bakry and Qian [4], S. Y. Cheng’s Liouville The-
orem for sublinear growth f-harmonic functions has been extended in a non-submitted
paper in the 2007 Habilitation Thesis of the third named auth or to symmetric diﬀu-
sion operator ∆fon complete Riemannian manifolds with Ricm
f≥0form∈[n,+∞[.
The content of [11] is extended to the setting of metric measu re space (see Hua-Kell-Xia
[20] and Kuwada-Kuwae [27]) for sublinear growth harmonic f unctions. But our result
is not covered by them. Theorem 1.9 also extends the classica l results on the bounded
Liouville property for harmonic maps from complete smooth R iemannian manifolds with
non-negative Ricci curvature into regular geodesic balls o f complete smooth Riemannian
manifolds with positive upper sectional curvature bounds p roved by Hildebrandt-Jost-
Wideman [17] and Choi [12]. Moreover, Theorems 1.7 and 1.9 ex tend the bounded Li-
ouville properties for V-harmonic maps proved in [9, 53, Theorem 2] under Ric∞
V≥0.
Note that there was no such Liouville theorem for sublinear g rowthV-harmonic maps into
Cartan-Hadamard manifolds in the past literature. In Theor em 1.7, we do not assume
the boundedness condition for the V-harmonic map as in [9, 53, Theorem 2] when (N,h)
is a Cartan-Hadamard manifold. As in Remark 1.13(iii), Theo rem 1.12 is an extension of
[9, Theorem 5]. Note that Corollary 1.14 can not be deduced fr om Theorem 1.9.
Our proof of Theorem 1.7 based on the method by [59] is stochas tic, but the proof
in [59, §2 Lower bound] is questionable, because in [59] ther e is no explicit proof for the
sublinear growth condition for the norm |du|of diﬀerential map du:TM→TNfor

--- PAGE 10 ---
harmonic map u:M→N, and the method of [59, §3 Upper bound] does not work
well by using the Laplacian comparison theorem under Ricm
V≥0withm∈]− ∞,1]
(see Section 2 for such Laplacian comparison theorems). To o vercome this diﬃculty, in
addition to the non-negative bound for (m,V)-Ricci curvature, we consider conditions
(Ai)forV-Laplacian acting on the radial function (see Section 2). Mo reover, we prove
that for each i= 1,2,3the growth condition (Gi)for theV-harmonic map uimplies
the same growth condition (Gi)for|du|under (B3) (see Lemma 5.1). This ﬁlls the
incompleteness of the arguments in [59, §2 Lower bound]. The proof of Theorem 1.9 is
based on Theorem 1.7 and the inheritance of the bounded Liouv ille property for functions
to maps ﬁrstly shown by W. Kendall (see [22, 23, 24]). Finally , we emphasize that our
results obtained by stochastic method are new, that is, ther e were no such results obtained
by geometric analysis in the past literature.
2 Laplacian comparison theorem
LetVbe aC1-vector ﬁeld on a complete Riemannian manifold (M,g). In general, Vis
not necessarily a gradient type like V=∇f. However, we can make a function fVwhich
plays a similar role like fprovided V=∇f. Deﬁne
Vγ(r) : =/integraldisplayr

Note that Vγdepends on the choice of unit speed geodesic γ, andfV(x)depends on pwith
fV(p) = 0 and it is well-deﬁned for x∈M. It is easy to see that fV(x) =/integraltextrp(x)
0Vrp(γs)ds
forx /∈Cut(p), whereγis the unique unit speed geodesic with γ0=pandγrp(x)=x.
Moreover, for x /∈Cut(p),fV(x) =Vγ(rp(x))for the unique unit speed geodesic γwith
γ0=pandγrp(x)=x. Hence fV(γt) =Vγ(t)for any unit speed geodesic γwithγ0=p
andγt/∈Cut(p). WhenV=∇fis a gradient vector ﬁeld for some f∈C2(M), then one

Since(M,g)is complete, sp(x)is ﬁnite and well-deﬁned from the basic properties of
Riemannian geodesics.
The following theorem is a special case of [30, Theorem 2.5] ( see also [29, Theorem 2.3]).

Recall that fVdepends on p. We deﬁne fV(r) := supBr(p)fVandfV(r) := inf Br(p)fV.
ThenfV(rp(x))andfV(rp(x))are rotationally symmetric functions around p. We now
consider the following conditions, which are weaker than th e conditions (A1),(A2) and
(A3), respectively:
(A1)∗fVis bounded, or t/ma√sto→fV(γt)is increasing for any unit speed geodesic γwith

(A3)∗There exists D≥1such that fV(r)−fV(r)≤n−m

Recall the condition (Bi)for eachi= 1,2,3.

Lemma 2.2. The condition (B3)is equivalent to the following condition (B3)∗.
(B3)∗There exist a∈]0,d(p,Cut(p))[andD≥1such that ∆Vrp(x)≤D(1+rp(x))for
allx∈M\(Cut(p)∪Ba(p)).
Proof. It is easy to see that (B3) implies (B3)∗by taking any small a∈]0,d(p,Cut(p))[.
Sincelimx→prp(x)∆Vrp(x) =n−1, taking a suﬃciently small a∈]0,d(p,Cut(p))[, we
can obtain the converse implication (B3)∗=⇒(B3).
Theorem 2.1 tells us the following:
Theorem 2.3. SupposeRicm

then the condition (B1) (resp.(B2),(B3))holds.
Proof. Note ﬁrst that (A1) (resp. (A2),(A3)) implies (A1)∗(resp. (A2)∗,(A3)∗).

Remark 2.7. As a special case of Theorem 2.6, Ric∞
V≥0implies(B3). In particular,

3 Construction of ∆V-diffusion processes and Kendall’s expression of
radial processes
In this section, we summarize the construction of ∆V-diﬀusion processes on Mand note
that the Kendall’s expression for radial processes remains valid for ∆V-diﬀusion process.

LetVbe aC1-vector ﬁeld and ∆V:= ∆− /a\}b∇acketle{tV,∇·/a\}b∇acket∇i}htdenote the V-Laplacian. The
construction of ∆V-diﬀusion process can be done by way of the horizontal diﬀusion pro-

From now on, the probability measure Pis taken for the underlying process starting
from point x, i.e.P:=Px. The details of the construction for ∆V-diﬀusion process can be
found in [61, §2.1]. We denote the ∆V-diﬀusion process by XV:= (Ω,Xt,(Ft)t≥0,F,Px).
The following is shown in [18, Proposition 1.1.5].
Theorem 3.1 ([18, Proposition 1.1.5]) .The diﬀusion process XVonMis tight in the

for allx∈M. Note here that τGn=σM\Gn∧ζandσM\Gn≥ζis equivalent to σM\Gn=
+∞.
Lemma 3.2. Let{Gn}be an increasing sequence {Gn}of relatively compact open sets
satisfying Gn⊂Gn+1⊂Mfor anyn∈NandM=/uniontext∞
n=1Gn. The following assertions
are equivalent and hold.
(i)The diﬀusion process XVonMhas no killing inside, i.e.,
Px(Xζ−∈M,ζ <∞) = 0 (3.4)
for allx∈M.
(ii)We have
Px(σM\Gn< ζ for all n∈N) = 1 (3.5)
for allx∈M.
(iii)We have
Px/parenleftBig
lim
n→∞σM\Gn=ζ/parenrightBig
= 1 (3.6)
for allx∈M.
Proof. We ﬁrst prove (i). Let {Gn}be the exhaustion as stated above. Let us consider
a pre-semi-Dirichlet form (EGn,C1
0(Gn))onL2(Gn;νg)deﬁned by
EGn(f,g) =/integraldisplay

Moreover, for any α > α 0, there exists 0< λ1≤λ2depending on αsuch that

no killing inside in the sense that
Px(XτGn−∈Gn,τGn<+∞) = 0νg-a.e.x∈Gn. (3.11)
From (3.11), we can deduce
Px(Xζ−∈M,ζ <+∞) = 0νg-a.e.x∈M. (3.12)
Indeed, under ζ <+∞, we have limn→∞XτGn−=Xζ−immediately from (3.2). Take
n > ℓ > k . Then
Px(XτGn−∈Gℓ,ζ <+∞)≤Px(XτGn−∈Gℓ,τGn<+∞)
≤Px(XτGn−∈Gn,τGn<+∞) = 0 forνg-a.e.x∈Gk.
Thus
Ex[1Gℓ(XτGn−) :ζ <+∞] = 0νg-a.e.x∈Gk.
From this,
Ex[1Gℓ(Xζ−) :ζ <+∞]≤Ex[lim
n→∞1Gℓ(XτGn−) :ζ <+∞]
≤lim
n→∞Ex[1Gℓ(XτGn−) :ζ <+∞] = 0νg-a.e.x∈Gk.
Lettingℓ→ ∞ andk→ ∞, we obtain (3.12). Next we prove that Px(Xζ−∈M,ζ <+∞)
is an excessive function with respect to XV. Indeed, by ζ◦θt= (ζ−t)+,
pt(P•(Xζ−∈M,ζ <+∞))(x)

. Letting n→ ∞, we
getRαf= 0νg-a.e. onM. Hence Rαf= 0onMby the strong Feller property of XV
(see [47],[2, Proposition 1.11]). Thus we obtain Meyer’s hy potheses (L) for XV. Then,
for any excessive function honM,h= 0νg-a.e. implies h= 0onMby [57, (10.25)].
Therefore, applying this to the excessive function h:=P•(Xζ−∈M;ζ <∞), we obtain
(i) from (3.12).
Next we prove (i) =⇒(ii). By (3.3), limn→∞σM\Gn> ζorlimn→∞σM\Gn=ζPx-a.s. on
{ζ <+∞}. This implies that σM\Gn= +∞for some n∈NorσM\Gn< ζfor alln∈N
Px-a.s. on{ζ <+∞}, because σM\Gn≥ζis equivalent to σM\Gn= +∞. Thanks to (3.4)
for allx∈M, underζ <+∞, the former case, i.e., σM\Gn= +∞for some n∈Ndoes
not occur. Under ζ= +∞, by (3.3), limn→∞σM\Gn= +∞. Applying (3.4) for all x∈M
again,σM\Gn= +∞for some n∈Ndoes not occur in this case. Therefore, we obtain
(ii). The implication (ii) =⇒(iii) is clear from (3.3).
Finally, we prove (iii) =⇒(i). Suppose limn→∞σM\Gn=ζ. IfσM\Gn=ζfor some
n∈N, thenσM\Gn=ζ= +∞. So under ζ <+∞, this does not occur. Hence σM\Gn< ζ
for alln∈Nunderζ <+∞. Then, we see limn→∞XσM\Gn=Xζ−andXσM\Gn∈M\Gn

4 Bochner Identity
In this section, based on the Bochner identity for smooth map u:M→Nin terms of
usual Laplace-Bertrami operator ∆, we establish the Bochner identity for u:M→Nin
terms of ∆V. We denote the Levi-Civita connection on Mby∇M. Let{ei}n
i=1be the
canonical ONB of TM, i.e.,ei= (∂/∂xi)x, andu−1TNthe induced vector bundle from
TNbyu, i.e., the ﬁbre bundle over Mwith ﬁbre Tu(x)Nforx∈M. Moreover ∇u−1TN
denotes the induced connection from the Levi-Civita connec tion∇NonN. Let∇be the
connection over TM∗⊗u−1TNinduced from the dual connection ∇∗overTM∗and the
connection ∇u−1TNoveru−1TN(see [48, (3.23)] for the deﬁnition of ∇). The Hessian

We need the following lemma to prove Corollary 4.3.

Lemma 4.2. LetHbe a real separable Hilbert space and suppose that hij∈Hsatisﬁes

Hand the assertion for H=R. Next we prove
the second assertion. In view of the Fourier expansion h=/summationtext∞

Ker(hij) :={φ∈Rn|(hij)φ= 0Hn},Ker(/a\}b∇acketle{thij,eℓ/a\}b∇acket∇i}htH) :={φ∈Rn|(/a\}b∇acketle{thij,eℓ/a\}b∇acket∇i}htH)φ= 0Rn}.
Therefore, if (hij)has a null eigenvalue 0Hwith multiplicity k, then the real symmetric
matrix(/a\}b∇acketle{thij,eℓ/a\}b∇acket∇i}htH)has the null eigenvalue 0with multiplicity kfor allℓ∈N. The converse
also holds. The rest of the proof is similar to the proof of the ﬁrst assertion.

In [49], Ohta extended (4.6)to the case m∈[−∞,0[, which is a special case of
(4.7) below for ε= 1. On the other hand, Kolesnikov-Milman [26] also obtained
(4.6) including the case m= 0with the convention 1/0−:=−∞. Our inequality
(4.5) is diﬀerent from (4.6) at least for the case m= 0. The inequality (4.6) can
be proved for general V. Indeed, by the same argument as used for the proof of

The inequality (4.7) is meaningful even if m= 0andε= 0with the convention

m= 0. Our inequality (4.5) for V=∇fis a consequence of (4.7) for ε= 0.
(iv) When u:M→NisV-harmonic, (4.1) is also proved in [9, Lemma 1].
Lemma 4.5. Suppose that (N,h)is a Cartan-Hadamard manifold. Let u:M→Nbe a
V-harmonic map. Then ∆Vd2

In the last inequality above, we use the Greene-Wu Hessian co mparison theorem under
SectN≤0(see [15, Theorem A], [58, p. 227], [54, Chapter IV, Lemma 2.9 ]), where we use
the completeness and simple connectedness of (N,h). Note that HessNdN(·,o)2(e′

5 Polynomial growth of differential map for V-harmonic maps
In this section, we show that for each i= 1,2,3, if a smooth V-harmonic map u:M→N
has a growth condition (Gi)under(B3) andRicm
V≥0withm∈[−∞,0]∪[n,+∞],
then the diﬀerential map du:TM→TNalso has the same growth (Gi). For this, we
need the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1. AssumeRicm
V≥0withm∈[−∞,0]∪[n,+∞]. Suppose that u:M→N
is a smooth V-harmonic map and (B3). Then for each p∈M, there exist C=C(p,D)>
0andA=A(p,D)>0such that
sup
x∈Ba(p)|du|2(x)≤C(mu(2a)+1)2fora > A.
Heremu(2a) := supB2a(p)dN(u,o). In particular, for each i= 1,2,3if(Gi)holds for
u, then it holds for |du|.
Proof. Let˜ϕ(r)be aC2-function deﬁned on [0,+∞[such that ˜ϕ(r)>0forr∈[0,2[
and
˜ϕ(r) :=/braceleftbigg
1 ifr∈[0,1],
0 ifr∈[2,+∞[

with
0≥˜ϕ′(r)/radicalbig
˜ϕ(r)≥ −C1
and
˜ϕ′′(r)≥ −C2
for some constants C1,C2>0(see [37, proof of Theorem 1.2] or [34, proof of Theo-
rem 1.5]). We set
ϕ(x) := ˜ϕ/parenleftbiggrp(x)
a/parenrightbigg
.
We then see that on B2a(p)\Cut(p)

Then,Ghas a maximum at ¯x∈B2a(p). At this point rpmay not be twice diﬀeren-
tiable. We will remedy this by the Calabi’s argument (see [8] ): Letγ: [0,rp(¯x)]→M
be the minimal geodesic joining γ0=pandγrp(¯x)= ¯x. Letε >0be small. Along γ,
γεis not conjugate to ¯x. So there exists a geodesic cone Cwith vertex γεand contains
a neighborhood of ¯xsuch that x/ma√sto→rγε(x)is smooth inside C. Let˜rε(x) :=rγε(x) +ε.
Then triangle inequality states that
rp(x)≤˜rε(x)forx∈C, r p(¯x) = ˜rε(¯x). (5.4)
Then˜Gε:= ˜ϕ/parenleftbig˜rε

Fis smooth near ¯xand also attains the same maximum value at ¯x.
Lettingε→0, we may assume without loss of generality that rpis already smooth near
¯x.
IfF(¯x) = 0, we have |du| ≡0onB2a(p). Then we have the conclusion. So we may
assumeF(¯x)>0, hence|du|(¯x)>0. At¯x, we have
0≥∆V(ϕF)and∇(ϕF) = 0.

estimate for harmonic map ulike Lemma 5.1. In [59], such a gradient estimate for

8 Proofs of Theorem 1.9, Corollaries 1.10, 1.11 and Theorem 1 .12
Our proof relies on the convex geometry on the regular geodes ic ball on complete Riman-
nian manifolds with positive upper curvature, ﬁrst introdu ced by Kendall [23, 24]. In our
situation, more precisely, there exists a convex function Φ :BR(o)×BR(o)→R, such
that for any geodesic γinBR(o)×BR(o), there exists a positive constant C,
d2
dt2Φ(γ(t))≥C/parenleftbiggd
dtΦ(γ(t))/parenrightbigg2
. (8.1)
Moreover, Φis a nonnegative and bounded function. It is also symmetric Φ(x,y) =
Φ(y,x), and vanishes only on its diagonal, i.e. Φ(x,y) = 0 if and only if x=y. For the
concrete construction of Φ(x,y), see [24].
Lemma 8.1. Fixq∈BR(o), thenΦ(u(x),q)can be considered as a function on M.
Moreover, we have
∆VΦ(u(x),q)≥0. (8.2)
Proof. Recall that for harmonic map u, we have
∆VΦ(u(x),q) =n/summationdisplay
i=1HessNΦ(·,q)(du(ei),du(ei)). (8.3)

--- PAGE 35 ---
HereHessNΦ(·,q)is the Hessian of Φ(·,q)with respect to (N,h). Notice that for a geodesic
γ(t)∈BR(o), we have
d2
dt2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
t=t0Φ(γ(t),q) = HessNΦ(·,q)(˙γ(t0),˙γ(t0)).
Now we consider the geodesic γ(t), such that for γ(t0) =u(x)and˙γ(t0) =X, where
X∈Tu(x)N. Then,
d2

i=1/a\}b∇acketle{t∇NΦ(u(x),q),du(ei)/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht2≥0.
Now we are in the position to prove Theorem 1.9.
Proof of Theorem 1.9. Recall that XVis conservative by Corollary 3.5. According to
(8.2), we know that Φ(u,q)can be seen as a bounded V-subharmonic function on M.
Then it suﬃce to prove a special case of Theorem 1.7, with N=Randv(x) := Φ(u(x),q)
is a non-negative, bounded V-subharmonic function on M.
As before, let Xtbe the diﬀusion on Mwhose generator is ∆Vand with initial position
X0=x. Now apply Itô’s formula for v(Xt), we derive that
mt:=v(Xt)−v(X0)−/integraldisplayt
0∆Vv(Xs)ds
is a local ( Px-)martingale. Thus, by Lemma 8.1 v(Xt)is a non-negative, bounded, local
submartingale. Let {Gn}the increasing sequence of relatively compact open sets sat isfying
Gn⊂Gn+1⊂Mforn∈NandM=/uniontext∞
n=1Gn. Thenn/ma√sto→v(XτGn)is a discrete time
submartingale. By the martingale convergence theorem, the re exists a unique limit of
v(XτGn),Px-a.s.
Now letIm(u)⊂BR(o)be the image of uand we may assume that it is a compact
subset of BR(o). Then for each ω∈Ω, there exists a subsequence nk=nk(ω)such that
the limit
lim
k→∞u(XτGnk(ω)) =L(ω)∈BR(o)⊂N
exists.
Therefore, we may conclude that for each ω∈Ω,
lim
n→∞v(XτGn(ω)) = lim
k→∞Φ(u(XτGnk(ω)),q) = Φ(L(ω),q).
35

--- PAGE 36 ---
Moreover, we also have
lim
n→∞v(XτGn◦θt) = Φ(L◦θt,q).
On the other hand, for large n∈N,t < τGn, hencet+τGn◦θt=τGnPx-a.s. so that
lim
n→∞v(XτGn)◦θt= lim
n→∞v(Xt+τGn◦θt) = lim
n→∞v(XτGn) = Φ(L,q)
holdsPx-a.s. for all x∈M. Thus
Φ(L◦θt,q) = Φ(L,q)
holds for any q∈BR(o). Taking q=L(ω), we have
Φ(L◦θt(ω),L(ω)) = 0 fort∈[0,+∞[
implying that L◦θt(ω) =L(ω). Therefore L∈/intersectiontext
0<t<∞It, where Itis the invariant
σ-ﬁeld ofθt. We claim that Iis trivial, leading to that Lis constant L≡L∞,Px-a.s..
To prove the triviality of I, ﬁrst notice that for any A∈I, we have Px(A|Ft) =
PXt(A), meaning that the function x/ma√sto→Px(A)is ﬁnelyV-harmonic on M, i.e.t/ma√sto→PXt(A)
is a local ( Px-)martingale. Indeed, for any increasing sequence {Gn}of relatively compact
open sets satisfying Gn⊂Gn+1⊂Mforn∈NandM=/uniontext∞
n=1Gn,Yt:=PXt∧τGn(A)is a
bounded martingale: for s < t
Ex[Yt|Fs] =Ex/bracketleftBig
PXt∧τGn(A)|Fs]
=Ex/bracketleftbig
Px(A|Ft∧τGn)|Fs]
=Px(A|Fs∧τGn) =Ys.
Meanwhile by taking N=Rin Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 in Kendall’s paper [25], we see that
x/ma√sto→Px(A)is in fact smooth on M. Indeed, Px(A)is ﬁnelyV-harmonic and the vector
ﬁeldVis of course locally bounded. It is worth to point out that in t he proof of [25,
Theorem 3.1], we do not need to assume the continuity of the ma p.
Therefore, the local ( Px-)martingale property and the smoothness give rise to that
Px(A)is aV-harmonic function. By Theorem 1.7, we derive that Ex[1A]≡cfor some
constant 0≤c≤1.
On the other hand, we have c2=c. To see this, the invariance of Aand Markov
property give rise to
c=Ex[1A] =Ex[Ex[12
A|I]] =Ex[1AEx[1A|I]] =Ex[1Alim
t→∞Ex[1A|It]]
=Ex[1Alim
t→∞Ex[1A◦θt|It]] =Ex[1Alim
t→∞EXt[1A]] =c2,
implying that either c= 0orc= 1.
Thus,
lim
n→∞Φ(u(XτGn),L∞) = Φ(L(ω),L∞) = 0.
36

--- PAGE 37 ---
Consequently, submartingale property of n/ma√sto→Φ(u(XτGn),L∞)gives rise to
Φ(u(x),L∞)≤lim
n→∞Ex/bracketleftbig
Φ(u(XτGn),L∞)/bracketrightbig
= 0,
leading to Φ(u(x),L∞) = 0,Px-a.s. for all x∈M, sinceΦ(x,y)is nonnegative. Therefore
by the vanishing property, we have
u≡L∞.
Proof of Corollary 1.10. By Remark 2.7, Ric∞
V≥0implies (B3) and Theorem 1.9
remains valid by replacing (A3) with(B3). Then we obtain the conclusion.
Proof of Corollary 1.11. By Corollary 2.8, Ricm
V≥0with the boundedness of Vim-
plies(B3) and Theorem 1.9 remains valid by replacing (A3) with(B3). Then we obtain
the conclusion.
To prove Theorem 1.12, we need the following:
Lemma 8.2. Suppose that the ∆V-diﬀusion process XV= (Ω,Xt,Px)is recurrent. Then
every bounded ﬁnely V-subharmonic (orV-superharmonic )function is constant. In par-
ticular, every bounded smooth V-subharmonic (orV-superharmonic )function is constant.
Conversely, if every bounded ﬁnely V-subharmonic function is constant, then XVis re-
current.
Proof. Suppose that XVis recurrent. The recurrence of XVimpliesPx(ζ= +∞) = 1
forx∈M(see [16, (3.4) Lemma]). First note that any smooth bounded V-subharmonic
function is ﬁnely V-subharmonic. This is easily conﬁrmed by way of Itô’s formul a. Letf
be a bounded ﬁnely V-subharmonic (resp. V-superharmonic) function, then g:=/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl∞−f
(resp.g=/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl∞+f) is a non-negative ﬁnely V-superharmonic function. Let {Gn}be
the increasing sequence of relatively compact open sets sat isfyingGn⊂Gn+1⊂Mfor
n∈NandM=/uniontext∞
n=1Gn. Thent/ma√sto→g(Xt∧τGn)is a bounded supermartingle, hence
Ex[g(Xt) :t < τ Gn]≤g(x)for anyt >0andx∈M. Letting k→ ∞ , we have
Ex[g(Xt)]≤g(x)for anyt >0andx∈M. Sincegis ﬁnely continuous, gis an excessive
function with respect to XV. Therefore we obtain the ﬁrst conclusion. Conversely suppo se
that any bounded ﬁnely V-subharmonic function is constant. Let gbe a bounded excessive
function with respect to XV. ThenEx[g(Xt∧τGn)]≤g(x)for allt >0andx∈Mby [5,
Chapter II, (2.8) Proposition]. From this, we can deduce tha tt/ma√sto→g(Xt∧τGn)is a bounded
supermartingale, that is, gis ﬁnelyV-superharmonic. By assumption, gis constant. For
general excessive function g, for each ℓ >0,g∧ℓis a bounded excessive function and
it is a constant. If gtakes diﬀerent values g(x1)andg(x2)withg(x1)< g(x2), then
g(x)∧/parenleftBig
g(x1)+g(x2)
2/parenrightBig
has the constant value c. Then one can obtain c=g(x1) =g(x1)+g(x2)
2
so thatg(x1) =g(x2). This is a contradiction. Therefore gis constant, hence XVis
recurrent.
Proof of Theorem 1.12. By Lemma 8.2, Φ(u,o)is constant. Thanks to the concrete
expression of Φshown in [24, Theorem 3], dN(u,o)is constant. Then one can conclude
37

--- PAGE 38 ---
thatu(M)⊂∂Br(o)⊂BR(o)for some r >0. Fix an x0∈M. SinceBR(o)∩Cut(o) =∅,
u(x0)andocan be joined by a unique minimal geodesic in BR(o). On this geodesic
arc, we can choose a point ˆo∈BR(o)which is diﬀerent from osuch that we can ﬁnd
another geodesic ball Bˆr(ˆo)satisfying Br(o)⊂Bˆr(ˆo)⊂BR(o). Applying Lemma 8.1 to
Φ(u,ˆo), it is constant so that dN(u,ˆo)≡˜r, that is, u(M)⊂∂B˜r(ˆo)for some ˜r >0.
Then we see ˜r=dN(u(x0),ˆo) =r−dN(o,ˆo). Obviously, u(x0)∈∂Br(o)∩∂B˜r(ˆo).
Suppose there exists a diﬀerent u(x1)/\e}atio\slash=u(x0)such that u(x1)∈∂Br(o)∩∂B˜r(ˆo). Since
u(x1)/\e}atio\slash=u(x0),u(x1)does not lie on the minimal geodesic joining oandu(x0). Then
r=dN(u(x1),o)<dN(u(x1),ˆo)+dN(ˆo,o) = ˜r+dN(ˆo,o). This is a contradiction. Hence
∂Br(o)∩∂B˜r(ˆo) ={u(x0)}, consequently, u(M)⊂∂Br(o)∩∂B˜r(ˆo) ={u(x0)}implies
u(M) ={u(x0)}.
