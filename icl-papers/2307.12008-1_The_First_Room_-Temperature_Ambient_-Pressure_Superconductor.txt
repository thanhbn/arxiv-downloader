Abstract  
 
For the  first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the room -temperature superconductor 
(Tc ≥ 400 K, 127 oC) working at ambient pressure with a modified lead -apatite  (LK-99) structure.  
The superconductivity  of LK -99 is prove d with the Critical temperature ( Tc), Zero -resistivity, 
Critical current ( Ic), Critical magnetic field ( Hc), and the Meissner effect . The superconductivity 
of LK-99 originates from minute structur al distortion  by a slight volume shrinkage  (0.48 %) , not 
by external factors such as temperature and pressure.  The shrinkage is caused by  Cu2+ substitution 
of Pb2+(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate  and it generates  the stress . It 
concurrently  transfer s to Pb(1) of the cylindrical column  resulting in distortion of the cylindrical 
column  interface , which creates superconducting quantum wells  (SQWs)  in the interface.  The heat 
capacity results indicated that the new model  is suitable  for explaining the superconductivity of 
LK-99. The unique structure  of LK -99 that allows  the minute distorted structure to be maintained 
in the interface s is the most important factor that LK -99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity 
at room  temperature s and ambient pressure .

2 Introduction  
Since the discovery of the first superconductor (1), many efforts to search for new room -
temperature superconductor s have been ca rried out  worldwide (2, 3) through their experimental 
clarity  or/and  theoretical  perspective s(4-8). The recent s uccess of developing room -temperature 
superconductor s with hydrogen sulfide (9) and y ttrium super-hydride(10) has great attention 
worldwide, which is expected  by strong electron -phonon coupling  theory with  high-frequency 
hydrogen phonon modes (11, 12 ). However, it is difficult to apply them to actual  application 
device s in daily  life because of the tremendous ly high pressure , and more  efforts  are being made 
to overcome the high -pressure problem (13). 
For the first time in the world, we  report the succe ss in synthesizing  a room -temperature and 
ambient -pressure superconductor with a chemical approach to solve the temperature and  pressure 
problem. We named the first room temperature and ambient pressure superconductor LK-99. The 
superconductivity  of LK -99 proved  with the Critical temperature ( Tc), Zero -resistivity, Critical 
current ( Ic), Critical magnetic field ( Hc), and Meissner effect (14, 15 ). Several data were collected  
and analyzed in detail  to figure out the puzzle  of superconductivity of LK -99: X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 
(EPR),  Heat Capacity , and Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) data. 
Henceforth  in this paper , we will report  and discuss  our new findings  including superconducting 
quantum wells  associated with the superconductivity  of LK -99.

4 each 20 K increment of temperature  in the vacuum of 10-3 Torr. In various bulk samples, specific 
resistance was measured in the range of 10-6 to 10-9 Ω·cm. Also, a thin film of LK -99 was 
fabricated  on the precision glass plate by a thermal vapor deposition  process  (UNIVAC, Korea). 
Figure 1(b) shows the Zero -resistivity of the thin film  of LK-99, which satisfied the zero -resistivity 
of international standards (16, 17 ) as a new superconductor. According to the International 
Electrotechnical Commission standards (16), there are two equivalent criteria (17) for 
superconductivity : the electric field criterion with 1 µV/ cm or 0.1 µV/cm and resistivity criterion 
with 10-11  Ω·cm. As shown in Figure 1(b), the measured voltage  was obtained in the range of 0.1 
µV/cm during the applied current increasing and decreasing. Also,  the resistivity was calculated 
in the order of 10-10 ~ 10-11 Ω·cm. As the grain boundary  is decreased , the residual resistance of 
the thin film decreased (18). Figure1( c) shows the external magnetic field (H)  dependence of 
applied current.  Even up to 400 K, the DC magnetization value of Zero field cooling and Field 
cooling with 10 Oe was still negative in Figure 1(d). These results indicate  that the superconducting 
phase still exist s under 10 Oe up to 400 K.  Additionally, the critical current value was not yet zero 
(7 mA)  even at 400 K and 3000 Oe or more in Figure 1(e) and (f). Therefore, we judge that the 
critical temperature of LK -99 is over 400 K.  Moreover , since LK-99 has a polycrystalline  
morphology  shown  in Figure 2, the non-uniform resistivity  of the  bulk samples  can be explained 
as inter-grain boundaries, intergranular vortex flow, free vortex flow (18-20) of polycrystalline 
superconduct ing phase . The Josephson -like phenomenon  (Figure S1 (a) in supplementary materials)  
for the under -damped  junction of superconductor -normal m etal-superconductor (21, 22 ) or Inter -
grain coupled superconductors (23) and the thermoelectric  effect (24-26) of the inter- or intra -grain 
network (Figure S1 (b) in supplementary materials)  were  also observed.

Figure 2. XRD results of LK -99 matched with COD , the original XRD data was only K α2-stripped 
without any other processing.  
 
Figure 2 shows the results  of LK -99 matched with the QualX 2.0 software (27) and proved by 
simulated data using VESTA software (28), which uses  Crystallography Open Database  (COD ) to 
perform the search -match operation (27). It shows that LK-99 is polycrystalline . The ma in peaks 
were well matched with the lead-apatite  (AP)  structure , and few Cu2S impurit ies also shown . The 
crystal system of the original lead-apatite  is hexagonal  (P6 3/m, 176) with the cell parameters 
a=9.865 Å  and c=7.431 Å .  However, LK-99 show s a slight shrinkage compared to the Lead -
Apatite  with parameters of a=9.843 Å  and c=7.428 Å .  The volume reduction  of LK -99 is 0.48 %.  
Humankind has long learned that the properties of matter ste m from its structure. However, so 
far, the correlation between superconductivity and the structural change of material has hardly 
been properly clarified.  In fact, t he two main  factors affecting the generation  of superconductivity 
of superconductors discovered so far are temperature and pressure (29, 30 ). And both temperature 
and pressure affect  its volume . It seems  that the stress generated  by the decrease in  volume  under 
the low temperature or high pressure  causes a minute  strain or distortion . Although it is difficult 
to observe the  minute structur al changes in  superconducting material s, this structural change seems 
to br ing the superconductivity  of it. 

--- PAGE 6 ---
6 Representative examples showing the superconductivity due to the external factors  (pressure and 
temperature)  and the internal factors  (oxygen doping)  are CuO -based superconducting materials. 
The structure of CuO  changes from the tetragonal structure to the orthogonal structure depending 
on the  oxygen doping  contents . In addition, the higher  Tc is observed under the high  pressure 
condition (29). In the CuO based superconductors, it may be thought that the stress generated by 
the inconsistency of the amount of change in the c -axis and a and b -axis affects the intermediate 
CuO layer, causing structural distortion, and supe rconductivity  because the changes in the c -axis 
seems to be the most sensitive to changes in temperature and pressure.  And other  examples are 
what  we think of as the appearance  of superconductivity caused by  distortion  or strain  caused by 
fine physical stress.  When the FeSe monolayer on the top of the insulator is stacked, the highest 
Tc achieve s up to  65 K(31) and even  up to  109 K(32). However, the Tc lower s to 10 K  as layer 
stacks increases  (33-35). In the case of CuO monolayer films on Bi 2Sr2Cu2O8+δ, Zhong et al. 
identified two distinct and spatially separated gaps:  U-like gap and V -like gap (36). In 2019, Choi 
et al. proved the effect of 3D strain for Tc in the cuprate system (37), and BaFe 2As2 system also 
showed strain -induced superconductivity (38) in 2013. In 2008, Gozar  et al. reported high -
temperature interface superconductivity between metallic and insulating copper oxides (39). The 
thinner the layer, the greater the stress -induc ing effect, the greater the strain, which seems to be 
the higher the superconducting transition temperature . Therefore, we argue that t he stress caused 
by temperature and pressure bring s a minute  structural distortion  and strain , which create  an 
electronic state for superconductivity .

LK-99 is a gray -black color , as show n in Figure 3(b ). It is the superconductor with the same color 
as typical superconduct ors. The system of lead -apatite (40), Pb 10(PO 4)6O, is an ivory -colored 
powder and an insulator. The LK -99 has a three -dimensional network structure shown in  figure 
3(a) and a cylindrical column surrounded by an insulating tetrahedral PO 4 network structure.  And 
the cylindrical columns  arranged at intervals of 6.541 Å  are composed of asymmetric polyhedral 
six Pb(1) -On components consisting of two oppositely shape d triangles as sh own in the side -view 
of the cylindrical column  in Figure 3(e). The polyhedral four Pb(2) are components of insulating  
PO 4 network structures  of LK -99. The modified lead -apatite of LK -99 is expected to be Pb 10-
xCux(PO 4)6O, x=0.9 ~1.0, in which one of the four Pb(2) ion s approximately has been  replaced by 
Cu(II) ion at the polyhedral Pb(2) sites of the lead -apatite (41). In LK -99, the ratio of copper was

9 determined based on the  atomic %  data of XPS and confirmed  by the Debye heat capacity model 
with heat capacity result  and chemical formula Pb10-xCux(PO 4)6O, x=0.9 ~1.0. And i t is well 
consistent with previous published research result (41). This replacement of Cu2+ ions in LK -99 
resulted in a  volume reduction  of 0.48 % because Cu2+ ions (87 pm)  are smaller than Pb2+ ions 
(133 pm ). The stress was occurred in the network portion and then affected  the appearance  of 
superconductivity . 
As a result of  more  precise analysis of XRD and XPS data , it reveals  where  the stress from  volume  
reduction  was finally affected.  For the purpose of determin ing the variation of Pb(1) positions , 
One-dimensional electron density calculation (42) along one crystallographic axis  via the Fourier 
transform of the calculated structure factor  was used . The electron density  was calculated  along 
the z-direction, ρ( c), based on  the (00l) reflection intensities of XRD data using the following 
equation . 
𝜌(𝑧/𝑐)=1
𝑐∑ 𝐹(00𝑙)𝑒−𝑖(2𝜋𝑙𝑧
𝑐)∞
𝑙=−∞ 
Where l, F(00 l), c and z are the order of the (00 l) diffraction peak, the structure factor, the unit cell 
parameter of the c -axis, and the atomic coordinate along the z -axis, respectively . Since LK -99 has 
a hexagonal structure,  the above equation was applied for the electron density calculation of Pb(1) 
along the z -direction  (c-axis)  and x-direction  (a-axis) , and ρ(c) and ρ(a), based on  the (00 l) and 
(h00) reflection intensities of XRD data in Figure 2. As the result , the position of Pb(1) constituting 
the cylindrical column  is slightly shifted  in the a-axis plane from the original position by the 
substitution  of Cu2+ inward or outward  in Figure 3(c) . In the repeated triangular structure of Pb(1) 
of the cylindrical column , the distance between Pb(1) in one layer is decreased  to 2.61815  Å, and 
the next layer is increased to 5.23476 Å  from the original distance  of 3.03340  Å . However, the 
distance  (3.7140Å) through the c-axis between the triangular layers of Pb(1)  of LK-99 remains  

--- PAGE 10 ---
10 almost  unchanged from lead -apatite  (3.7153 Å). According to the analyzed  results of XP S data,  the 
binding energies  (B.E.)  of Pb(2)  and Phosphorus were unchanged . Although , the tetrahedral 
Phosphorus  splitting value between 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2very slightly increased  from 0.68 eV to 0.69 eV , 
and all oxygens B.E. are quite a bit increased by 0.21 eV, 0.33 eV, 0.56 eV, 0.89 eV, respectively. 
Also, the B.E. value of Pb(1) is slightly decreased by 0.03 eV.  From the results described above, 
it can be seen that the volume reduction was caused by the replacement of Cu2+ ions, and the stress 
caused by the volume reduction caused  the position change of Pb(1) and the binding energy change 
between oxygen atoms adjacent to Pb(1).  Figure 3(f) shows the EPR signal of LK -99. It is the 
same as the heterojunction quantum well such as Si/SiGe (43), natural DNA (44) in a dry state , and 
α-Fe2O3(45) doped with Mg2+. The EPR signal s were  interpreted as a cyclotron resonance signal 
of 2-dimensional electron gas (2 -DEG)  of quantum well , which  also confirmed  the creat ion of 
quantum wells  in the interface between Pb(1) and Phosphate of  LK-99. In addition,  the substituted  
Cu2+ ions were appeared  at 3000 Oe in EPR signal s as shown in Figure 3(f). The superconductivity 
with the 2 -DEG system of GaAs/AlGaAs (46) and DNA (47) was reported at 0.3 K and 1 K. The 
superconductor having interface structure like a heterojunction of the 2-DEG system such as 
LaAlO 3/SrTiO 3(48-50) has been shown the superconductivity . Hence , it is confirmed that  the 
superconducting quantum well  (SQW)  was generated between Pb(1) and Oxygens of Phosphate  
by structural distortion  and strain . The predicted SQW  was illustrated in Figure 3(e). The 
superconductivity of LK -99 is deeply related to SQW.  In 2002, Koji et al. already reported the 
similar EPR signals as shown in Figure 3(f) and the superconductivity with RuSr 2GdCu 2O8 
system (51). However, they did not interpret the EPR signals as SQW and to associate it with the 
appearance of superconductivity.

The heat capacity  of LK -99 was measured from 5 K to 400 K using Physical Property 
Measurement System (PPMS, DinaCool -9, Quantum Design, USA), and Debye temperatu re was 
calculated based on the heat capacity  data using Pb10-xCux(PO 4)6O formula  (x = 1)  through  the

where Cv is heat capacity, r is the number of atoms per molecule, N is the number of molecules, 
and k is the Boltzmann  constant.  Figure 4 shows  that the Debye temperature  of LK -99 is constantly 
changing from about 184 K to 1300 K . Thus, Tc cannot be calculated  with the electron -phonon 
prediction model s. The blue line curve (Debye temperature = 280 K) is the calculated heat capacity 
of the typical apatite  because the Debye temperature of the typical apatite is 280 K . The red line 
curve is the calculated heat capacity resu lts based on Debye temperature  (184.56 K) at a low 
temperature  (5 K)  of LK-99. In the case of conventional superconductors, it is relatively well 
explained by the electron -phonon model. And in the electron -phonon model, one of the most 

--- PAGE 12 ---
12 influential  parameters of predicting Tc is Debye temperature (52). The heat capacity curve  (black 
line curve)  of LK -99 does not follow the Debye model s, since the normal vibrational mode  is 
limited by  Cu2+ ions replacement  in the network  part of the LK-99. This result also confirm s that 
LK-99 has a structure distorted by the substitution of Cu2+ ions.  In terms of the EPR experimental 
results shown in LK -99, the expression of superconductivity can be explained by the formation of 
SQWs . There is also a paper explaining superconductivity with  the quantum well model (36). 
However , they did not show  EPR signals like  ours.  Figure 3(d) is the EPR signal measured on the 
sample  (LK-99) after Current -Voltage  measurement. Compared to the signal  in which no current 
is applied (Figure 3(f)), the overall signal intensities decreased, and the signal  intensit y of 
cyclotron resonance was relatively decreased in Figure 3(g). Additionally, in case of CuO based 
superconductors, the large absorption EPR signal appeared at a very low temperature and below 
1000 Oe external magnetic field (53, 54 ), and we also observed  with YBCO and Bi2212 . The signal 
below 1000 Oe  external magnetic field  can be interpreted as a signal by superconducting 
electrons (53, 54 ). 
Josephson installed a thin insulator between superconductors and discovered tunneling through 
which current flows. Tunneling occurred between the superconductor s(55). Likewise , if electrons 
are moved by tunneling between SQWs , the resistance will naturally be zero . Tunneling between 
SQWs  is likely to be possible , as SQWs are expected to be formed at 3.7 Å  ~ 6.5 Å  intervals  in 
LK-99. According to Kim’s paper (52), he used 1250 K Debye temperature for his calculation of 
room -temperature superconductor, which is mentioned for hydride in 1968 by Ashcroft (56). Even 
in that case, he argued  that the electron -electron interaction contributes to the higher temperature 
superconductivity than the electron -phonon interaction.  In LK -99 system,  the applied current 
seems to be trans ported through  the correlated SQWs of the cylindr ical column  via the tunneling 
process and coherently trans ported in 3-dimension with all SQWs  together . The additional 

--- PAGE 13 ---
13 experimental results  and discussions  on LK-99 will be published immediately in the next paper, 
including an interesting controllable levitation phenomenon  and the coexistence of magnetism and 
superconductivity , theoretical calculation, etc. LK-99 will be a n attractive  substance  for many 
researchers  that can solve various  confusing  puzzles  such as the pairing process and coexistence 
with magnetism, et c., related to superconductivity . 
 
Consequently, why does LK -99 exhibit superconductivity at room temperature and ambient 
pressure?  This is because the stress generated by  the Cu2+ replacement of Pb(2)2+ ion was not 
relieved  due to the structural uniqueness of LK -99 and at the same time  was appropriately 
transferred to the interface of the cylindrical column . In other words, t he Pb (1) atoms  in the 
cylindrical column  interface  of LK -99 occupy a structurally limited space . These atoms  are entirely 
affected by the stress and strain generated by Cu2+ ions.  Therefore, SQW s can be generated  in the 
interface  by an appropriate amount of distortion (57) at room temperature  and ambient pressure  
without a re laxation.  From this point of view, the stress due to volume contraction  by temperature 
and pressure  is relieved and disappeared  in CuO - and Fe -based superconductor system s because 
the relaxation process c annot be  limited  due to the structural freedom . Therefore, they need an 
appropriate temperature or pressure  to limit the  structural freedom  and to achieve the SQW  
generation.  The LK-99 is a very useful material for the study of superconductivity  puzzle s at room 
temperature . All evidence and explanation lead that LK -99 is the first room -temperature  and 
ambient -pressure superconductor.  The LK -99 has many possibilities for various applications such 
as magnet, motor, cable, levitation train, power cable, qubit for a quantum comput er, THz 
Antennas, etc. We believe that our new development will be  a brand -new historical event that 
opens  a new era for humankind.

Materials and Methods  
 
Sample Synthesis and Preparation  
For the sample synthesis of the LK -99, the general solid -state reaction was used. Lanarkite and 
Cu3P were uniformly mixed in a molar ratio of 1:1 in an agate mortar with a pestle. The sample 
was put into a reaction tube, sealed under the vacuum  of 10-5 Torr and reacted at 925°C for 10 hr. 
After the reaction, a dark gray ingot was obtained reproducibly and then made into the shape of 
thin cuboids for electrical measurements. For other analyses, it was pulverized and used as the 
form of powder. Th e reagents used for the above solid - state reaction was PbO (JUNSEI, GR), 
PbSO 4 (KANTO, GR), Cu (DAEJUNG, EP), and P (JUNSEI, EP).  
 
1) Preparation for lanarkite, Pb 2SO 5 
PbO and PbSO 4 powders were uniformly mixed in a molar ratio of 1:1 in an agate mortar with a 
pestle. And then, after the sample was transferred to an alumina crucible, it was reacted at 725 °C 
for 24 hour in a furnace. After completion of the reaction, white sample was  obtained. It was 
pulverized with the mortar.  
 
2) Preparation for copper phosphide, Cu 3P 
Cu and P powders were mixed in each composition ratio. And the sample was transferred in a 
quartz tube. The tube was sealed under the vacuum of 10-5 Torr and reacted a t 550 °C for 48 hour 
in a furnace. After taken out from the tube, a dark gray ingot was obtained and pulverized.  
 
Set-up for electrical properties measurement  

--- PAGE 19 ---
19 4-point probe measurement was performed with 4 four pogo test probes (YoungJinSa, Inc., 
Korea) in sulated from each other and arrayed in one line with the same distance (1.2mm). The 
Keithley 228A and Keithley 182 were used as voltage/current source and sensitive digital 
voltmeter, respectively. For accurate temperature control and measurement, we devel oped and 
used the self -designed heating device with a thermally insulated aluminum mounting plate and 
halogen lamp, as a heating source. The Self -developed  software , using LabView software, was 
also used for the measurement. All measuring instruments were linked with GPIB interface 
devices. Temperature measurement was carried out with Keithley 2000 with FLUKE 80BK -
DMM K -type thermocouple probe on the sample’s surface.  
Collection of XRD data  
XRD data collected with Rigaku (SmartLab, Japan) at Institute of Green Manufacturing 
Technology Green Manufacturing Research Center of Korea University.  
 
Measurement of Magnetic Properties with SQUID (MPMS)  
Magnetization measurement is performed with dc mode, 30 mm scan length, 10 scans per 
measurement, scan time 10s by using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) 
(MPMS3 -Evercool of KAIST Analysis Center for Research Advancement, Korea). Zero field -
cooling is processed from 400 K to 200 K without external magnetic field and then the 
temperature is increased from 200 K to 400 K with 10 Oe magnetic field. Finally, the sample is 
cooling down from 400 K to 200 K with 10 Oe magnetic field. The 45.814 mg sample is used for 
this measurement.  
 
Measurement of Electron Paramagnetic Resonanc e Spectroscopy  
EPR Spectroscopy is performed over the temperature range from 3.45 K to 295 K using a JES -
FA200 ESR X -band spectrometer (Jeol, Japan). The incident microwave power is 0.9980 mW, 

--- PAGE 20 ---
20 the receiver gains 100 and the sweep time (1 min). The modulate d magnetic field is 10 G at 100 
KHz and the swept external magnetic field is -100 ~ 9,900 Oe or 0 Oe ~ 10,000 Oe. The LK -99 
sample is set in a 5 mm quartz tube (Wilmad LabGlass, USA), sealed vacuum (5 x 10-5 torr) for 
LK-99 before I -V measurement, not seal ed vacuum for LK -99 sample after I -V measurement. 
And then the sealed quartz tube was loaded into a cylinder cavity equipped with a liquid helium 
cryostat system (Advanced Research Systems, USA).  
 
Measurement of Heat Capacity by PPMS  
The heat capacity  data were collected from 5 K to 400 K with 65.26 mg of LK -99 using by 
Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) (DynaCool -9, Quantum Design, USA) in 
Institute of Next -generation Semiconductor convergence Technology (DGIST, Korea). And the 
raw data was calib rated with heat capacity references of Cu 2S bulk and nanosheet, which is 
included in a small amount as an impurity.  
 
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Study on the lead -apatite and LK -99 
XPS data collected from ULVAC -PHI (X -TOOL, Japan), Institute of Green Manufacturing 
Technology Green Manufacturing Research Center of Korea University. The XPS data of the Pb, 
P, O and Cu are deconvoluted using XPSPEAK 4.1 software. The background is corrected using 
the Shirley background function and the Lorentzian (80%) -Gaussian (20%) sum function is used 
for fitting.

22 In the XPS results  of Cu, Binding Energy (B.E.) 932.05 eV, 951.91 eV is come from Cu(0) atom, 
which is residue of reactant Cu 3P. the only 933.78 eV, 954.03 eV are from the substituted Cu(II) 
ion of LK -99 matrix, the rest are satellite peaks of Cu(II) ions. And the amount of ato mic 
substitution is calculated using the relative atomic sensitivity. The result is about Cu/Pb=0.9/10.
