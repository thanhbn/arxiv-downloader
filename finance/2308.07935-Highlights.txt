Abstract
Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in decoding market trends and guiding strategic trading decisions. Despite the
deployment of advanced deep learning techniques and language models to refine sentiment analysis in finance, this study breaks
new ground by investigating the potential of large language models, particularly ChatGPT 3.5, in financial sentiment analysis,
with a strong emphasis on the foreign exchange market (forex). Employing a zero-shot prompting approach, we examine multiple
ChatGPT prompts on a meticulously curated dataset of forex-related news headlines, measuring performance using metrics such as
precision, recall, f1-score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the sentiment class. Additionally, we probe the correlation between
predicted sentiment and market returns as an addition evaluation approach. ChatGPT, compared to FinBERT, a well-established
sentiment analysis model for financial texts, exhibited approximately 35% enhanced performance in sentiment classification and
a 36% higher correlation with market returns. By underlining the significance of prompt engineering, particularly in zero-shot
contexts, this study spotlights ChatGPT’s potential to substantially boost sentiment analysis in financial applications. By sharing
the utilized dataset, our intention is to stimulate further research and advancements in the field of financial services.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background and Motivation
The financial services sector has long been an early adopter
of technological advancements, continually evolving to meet
the demands of a rapidly changing global landscape. From the
introduction of ATMs (Autmatic Teller Machines) and elec-
tronic trading to the rise of financial technologies (Fintech),
the financial sector has witnessed a transformative shift, par-
ticularly with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML) technologies (Arner et al., 2015). The
Fintech market has seen significant growth, demonstrating the
impact of these novel technologies in finance (Mordor Intel-
ligence, 2022). Such services include credit scoring and risk
assessment, fraud detection and prevention, robo-advisory ser-
vices as well as chatbots for customer service and support (Fa-
touros et al., 2023; Kotios et al., 2022).
Among the many facets of this transformation, sentiment
analysis has emerged as a critical tool for understanding mar-
ket dynamics and predicting future trends. The ability to ana-
lyze sentiments can provide valuable insights into the collective
mood of the market, thus enabling more informed and strategic
decision-making.

(Kalliopi Kouroumali), gmakridis@unipi.gr (Georgios Makridis),
dimos@unipi.gr (Dimosthenis Kyriazis)Traditionally, financial sentiment analysis has relied on man-
ually curated lexicons and simple ML algorithms (Schumaker
and Chen, 2009). However, with the rapid progress in Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP), more sophisticated tech-
niques are now available. Deep learning-based models, such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans-
formers) (Devlin et al., 2018) and its financial domain-specific
counterpart FinBERT (Liu et al., 2021), have significantly im-
proved sentiment analysis accuracy and reliability.
Despite these advancements, the financial domain presents
unique and multifaceted challenges to sentiment analysis. Fi-
nancial texts, particularly news headlines, are often saturated
with domain-specific terminology and nuanced sentiments,
complicating the task of sentiment classification (Loughran and
McDonald, 2011). A typical characteristic of financial text is
the interweaving of multiple topics, such as di fferent financial
instruments, in the same context. Consider, for instance, the
headline ”CAD is one of the better places to sell the US dollar
on a pullback.” Conventional sentiment analysis tools, might
predict a positive sentiment for this statement, which is accu-
rate concerning the Canadian dollar but misleading for the forex
pair USD /CAD. Such models mainly focus on sentiment clas-
sification, often failing to infer the subject of the text, i.e., the
financial instruments related to the sentiment, which is a crucial
aspect of financial analysis.
In addition to this, conventional sentiment analysis models
often lack the ability to adjust their output based on specific use-
case context, further limiting their broader applicability (Poria
Preprint submitted to Machine Learning with Applications November 6, 2023

--- PAGE 3 ---
et al., 2016). For example, the sentiment expressed in a dis-
cussion about a new governmental regulatory policy may di ffer
significantly depending on whether the context is an investor fo-
rum discussing potential market impacts or a consumer forum
discussing changes in service fees. Typical sentiment analysis
models may fail to capture these contextual nuances e ffectively,
offering room for more context-aware models to provide more
comprehensive and accurate sentiment analysis in the financial
domain (Poria et al., 2017). Thus, addressing these limitations
and meeting these specific challenges head-on represents a sig-
nificant area of opportunity for advancements in financial sen-
timent analysis.
Among the various AI tools, Generative Pre-trained Trans-
formers (GPT) and their related technologies have demon-
strated significant potential in revolutionizing multiple do-
mains, including the financial sector (George and George,
2023). GPT, a state-of-the-art language model developed by
OpenAI, is trained on an extensive corpus of data, enabling it
to understand and replicate patterns in human language with
remarkable precision (Radford et al., 2018). Since the intro-
duction of the initial GPT model in 2018, OpenAI has consis-
tently improved the architecture by adding new layers, imple-
menting technical adjustments, and extending training on ad-
ditional datasets, culminating in the latest and most advanced
version, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). However, the broader impact
of GPT on the public became evident towards the end of 2022
with the release of ChatGPT, a specialized version of the GPT
architecture fine-tuned for conversational applications.
ChatGPT o ffers promising opportunities to improve existing
financial applications, such as risk analysis through sentiment
analysis. By harnessing the power of ChatGPT’s advanced nat-
ural language understanding capabilities, financial institutions
can significantly enhance the accuracy and depth of sentiment
analysis. With its ability to comprehend and interpret complex
language patterns, it can more e ffectively analyze vast amounts
of unstructured data, such as news articles and headlines, to
provide a comprehensive understanding of market sentiment.
This improved sentiment analysis can, in turn, inform decision-
making in areas such as investment strategies, risk manage-
ment, and portfolio optimization, leading to better-informed
decisions and potentially higher returns (Tetlock, 2007; Chen
et al., 2014). Additionally, ChatGPT’s conversational abilities
can be utilized to communicate and explain complex risk anal-
ysis findings to both expert and novice users, making financial
insights more accessible and actionable (Yue et al., 2023).
These ChatGPT’s advanced natural language understanding
capabilities carry potential for a wealth of innovation in the fi-
nancial domain, including financial sentiment analysis. This
area, despite its significant implications, remains largely un-
tapped, signaling an open avenue for research and development.
The capacity of ChatGPT to interpret complex language pat-
terns, a characteristic often found in unstructured financial data,
presents a promising solution for enhancing the depth and ac-
curacy of sentiment analysis in financial contexts.1.2. Value Proposition
Acknowledging the noticeable lack of research, this work ex-
plores the potential of large language models (LLMs), particu-
larly ChatGPT 3.5, in the realm of financial sentiment analysis,
with a primary focus on the foreign exchange market (forex).
A zero-shot prompting approach is employed in this study, en-
abling us to assess ChatGPT’s capabilities in deciphering finan-
cial text, eliminating the need for domain-specific fine-tuning.
To ensure a reliable evaluation, we have meticulously curated
and annotated a dataset of forex-related news headlines. This
dataset, made publicly available, facilitates a comprehensive
evaluation of various ChatGPT prompts, thereby highlighting
the model’s extensive training on diverse datasets and its in-
herent adaptability in di fferent sectors, including finance. By
sharing this annotated dataset, we aim to contribute a valuable
resource to the research community, fostering further advance-
ments and innovation in the field of financial services and par-
ticularly in financial sentiment analysis.
The evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics, including
not only precision, recall, f1-score, and Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of the sentiment class, but also the correlation between
predicted sentiment and market returns (Hossin and Sulaiman,
2015). This detailed evaluation extends to sentiment class pre-
diction and sentiment score estimation for both single and mul-
tiple news headlines, demonstrating ChatGPT’s agility and pro-
ficiency in managing intricate financial texts.
Moreover, by benchmarking multiple prompts, this study un-
derscores the pivotal role of prompt engineering, especially in
zero-shot contexts, to optimize performance and boost the e ffi-
cacy of sentiment analysis. By shedding light on the enormous
potential of ChatGPT, this manuscript aims to instigate further
advancements and innovation in financial services.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section
2 reviews prior work on sentiment analysis in finance and dis-
cusses the role of AI tools such as ChatGPT and FinBERT in
this domain. Section 3 details our methodology, highlighting
our approach to using and evaluating ChatGPT for sentiment
classification in the forex market. Section 4 presents our find-
ings, which include performance metrics of sentiment classifi-
cation and sentiment correlation with market returns. In Section
5, we discuss the implications of our results, the potential ap-
plications of ChatGPT in financial services, as well as future
research directions. The paper is concluded in Section 6 with a
summary of our study’s key contributions.
2. Related Work
2.1. Sentiment Analysis in Finance
Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, refers to the use
of computational techniques to extract subjective information,
such as opinions and sentiments, from textual data (Bing,
2012). It has been applied to various domains, including cus-
tomer reviews, social media posts, and news articles. In finance,
sentiment analysis is used to gauge market sentiment, an essen-
tial aspect that could impact the price movement of financial
instruments (Bollen et al., 2011; Siering et al., 2018).
2

--- PAGE 4 ---
The idea that sentiment or public mood can influence finan-
cial markets dates back to the era of John Maynard Keynes
(Keynes, 1937), who described financial markets as being
driven by ”animal spirits” or waves of pessimism and optimism.
This notion has been substantiated by numerous empirical stud-
ies, demonstrating that changes in investor sentiment could sig-
nificantly a ffect asset prices and trading volume (Baker and
Wurgler, 2007; Tetlock, 2007).
Initially, financial sentiment analysis relied on manually cu-
rated financial lexicons, where words were pre-labeled as pos-
itive, negative, or neutral (Loughran and McDonald, 2011).
However, this approach was often too simplistic, overlooking
the context in which words were used. For example, the word
”crisis” may have negative connotations in general but could be
used in a positive context, such as ”the company successfully
averted a crisis.”
The advent of ML techniques brought significant advance-
ments in sentiment analysis. ML models, trained on labeled
financial news articles, were capable of learning from the con-
text in which words were used and thus provided more accurate
sentiment classifications (Schumaker and Chen, 2009). Never-
theless, traditional ML techniques, such as Naive Bayes, sup-
port vector machines, and decision trees, often failed to capture
long-term dependencies in the text and were susceptible to the
high dimensionality of the text data (Chen et al., 2018).
However, deep learning (DL) techniques and their applica-
tion to NLP has significantly evolved sentiment analysis. This
is particularly evident with the emergence of advanced lan-
guage models (LMs) such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), ULM-
Fit (Howard and Ruder, 2018), and transformer-based architec-
tures like BERT, which exhibit superior performance in sen-
timent classification tasks. With their ability to comprehend
context, these models can capture long-term dependencies in
text and e ffectively reduce data dimensionality via high-quality
embeddings. Domain-specific adaptations of BERT, like Fin-
BERT, further extend these capabilities, specifically tuned for
financial texts, hence bolstering the accuracy and reliability of
financial sentiment analysis. These developments highlight the
transformational potential of LMs in the field, enabling a more
nuanced understanding and prediction of sentiments.
Despite recent advancements, there are inherent challenges
in financial sentiment analysis. These include not only the need
to comprehend domain-specific jargon and to disentangle sub-
tle sentiments associated with multiple financial instruments
within the same context, but also the ability to adapt the sen-
timent output based on specific use-cases, prior conditions or
topics. For instance, a sentence might be perceived as nega-
tive for the general market economy but simultaneously pos-
itive for a specific stock. Current models, such as FinBERT,
primarily consider the perspective of the experts that annotated
the training data, limiting their flexibility to adjust their output
based on these finer nuances and making such framing of senti-
ment context-dependent an open challenge. This highlights the
necessity for future research directions that enhance the adapt-
ability and performance of sentiment analysis in finance. In this
regard, the advent of LLMs like GPT o ffers promising poten-
tial. The inherent capabilities of these models, including con-textual understanding and adaptability, could provide valuable
solutions to these challenges, opening new avenues for explo-
ration and study in this domain (Radford et al., 2019).
2.2. ChatGPT and Related AI Tools
With the success of GPT, an array of LLMs have been de-
veloped that showcase remarkable performance in various NLP
tasks. Each of these models brings unique advantages and ca-
pabilities to the field of NLP, including financial applications.
Among these, BloombergGPT stands out as a prominent ex-
ample that has exhibited excellent performance in several finan-
cial NLP tasks (Wu et al., 2023). Designed by Bloomberg’s AI
team, this model has been trained on a massive corpus of fi-
nancial texts. However, despite its notable success in various
financial tasks, BloombergGPT is yet to provide an open API,
with its application being primarily internal to Bloomberg as of
May 2023.
Another noteworthy mention in the realm of LLMs is
Google’s Bard the main rival of ChatGPT. This AI conver-
sational service is powered by Google’s LAMDA (Language
Model for Dialogue Applications), combining architectural fea-
tures of BERT and GPT (Thoppilan et al., 2022). Despite its
significant potential for engaging and contextually aware dia-
logues, it shares a similar limitation with BloombergGPT; as
of the time of writing, there is a widely open API available for
Bard.
An open-source alternative to GPT-3, BLOOM (Scao et al.,
2022), has also gained recognition among prominent LLMs.
BLOOM, though open-source, poses its own challenges. To
effectively utilize BLOOM, a considerable amount of special-
ized knowledge is required, alongside su fficient computational
resources. Furthermore, there isn’t a tuned version available
for conversation-specific tasks, a feature that makes models like
ChatGPT particularly useful.
Post the advent of ChatGPT, numerous LLMs with a focus
on more specific tasks have emerged, such as those designed
for code completion (Dakhel et al., 2023), content creation, and
marketing applications. These models, although more narrow
in their application, bring additional dimensions of utility and
specialization to the table, further expanding the possibilities
and impacts of LLMs. However the remarkable advancement
and proliferation of large language models, ChatGPT maintains
a leading position within the field (AI, 2023). Its accessibility
through an open API, vast scale of training data, and applicabil-
ity across an array of tasks highlights its considerable potential
and practical utility.
Notwithstanding the advancements in the application of
ChatGPT across various domains such as healthcare and edu-
cation (Sallam, 2023), its explicit application to financial sen-
timent analysis remains an underexplored area. Interestingly,
there seems to be a paucity of studies directly evaluating the
performance of ChatGPT through its API, which is a prerequi-
site for broader use and integration into third-party applications.
No known studies have, as yet, evaluated the performance of
ChatGPT specifically in the domain of financial sentiment anal-
ysis, and particularly within the context of the forex market.

This presents a remarkable gap in the current body of research
that this present study seeks to address. By casting our inves-
tigative lens on the application and performance of ChatGPT
within the sphere of sentiment analysis, and by directly inter-
acting with its API, we aim to contribute novel insights and
findings to this emergent field. This underlines the real-world
applicability and practicality of our approach, as it aligns with
the deployment scenario of incorporating ChatGPT into appli-
cations and services.
3. Methodology
In this section, we describe our methodology, focusing on
evaluating ChatGPT’s performance in financial sentiment anal-
ysis. We discuss data collection, preprocessing, and the deploy-
ment of ChatGPT using its API. Details about the experimental
setup, including prompt design and evaluation criteria, are also
presented, with an emphasis on the practical implications of our
findings in the financial sector.
3.1. Dataset Creation and Annotation
For a comprehensive exploration in this study, we collected
news headlines relevant to key forex pairs: AUDUSD, EU-
RCHF, EURUSD, GBPUSD, and USDJPY . The data was ex-
tracted from reputable platforms Forex Live1and FXstreet2
over a period of 86 days, from January to May 2023 (Fig.
2). According to Similarweb (Yeshayahou, 2021), these plat-
forms are recognized as leading sources for reliable news and
current forex analyses, o ffering critical insights into significant
economic and political events.
Our dataset comprises 2,291 unique news headlines. Each
headline includes an associated forex pair, timestamp, source,
author, URL, and the corresponding article text. Data collection
was accomplished using web scraping techniques executed via
a custom service on a virtual machine. This service periodically
retrieves the latest news for a specified forex pair (ticker) from
each platform, parsing all available information. The collected
data is then processed to extract necessary details such as the
article’s timestamp, author, and URL. The URL is further used
to retrieve the full text of each article. Finally, the data are
stored in a database (Fig. 3). This data acquisition process
repeats approximately every 15 minutes.
To ensure the reliability of the dataset and the validity of the
experimental evaluations, we manually annotated each head-
line for sentiment. Instead of solely focusing on the textual
content, we ascertained sentiment based on the potential short-
term impact of the headline on its corresponding forex pair.
This method recognizes the currency market’s acute sensitivity
to economic news, which significantly influences many trading
strategies (Evans and Lyons, 2005). As such, this dataset could
serve as an invaluable resource for fine-tuning sentiment analy-
sis models in the financial realm.

Figure 2: Time Series Plot of Sentiment Labels per Week
We used three categories for annotation: ’positive’, ’nega-
tive’, and ’neutral’, which correspond to bullish, bearish, and
hold sentiments respectively, for the forex pair linked to each
headline. Table 1 provides examples of annotated headlines
along with brief explanations of the assigned sentiment. Fig.
4 and 5 represent the overall sentiment distribution within the
dataset, as well as the distribution for each individual forex pair.
Furthermore, Fig. 6 and 7 display the most common tokens in
the headlines categorized as positive and negative sentiment, af-
ter stopwords, forex pairs, and central banks’ names have been
removed. Table 2 provides further quantitative detail on the
distribution of tokens in our dataset. It presents the average and
standard deviation of the number of tokens in both the complete
article and the headlines. The average number of tokens in each
article text is approximately 263, with a standard deviation of
159. For headlines, the average number of tokens is around
12, with a standard deviation of 3. These statistics reflect the
variability in the length of texts and headlines in the dataset.
Importantly, the number of tokens plays a significant role in
4

Figure 3: Dataset Creation Process
the response latency, cost, and performance of language mod-
els like ChatGPT. Longer texts require more computational re-
sources and time for processing, which can lead to increased
latency and cost. Conversely, shorter texts can be processed
faster and at a lower cost, but they might not provide as much
contextual information for the model to generate accurate and
relevant responses.
Figure 4: Sentiment Distribution
In an e ffort to contribute to the research community and fos-
ter transparency in our methodology, we have made our curated
dataset publicly accessible. This collection, featuring news
headlines linked to major forex pairs alongside their respec-
tive sentiments, is among the first of its kind. We anticipate
that it will serve as an invaluable resource for researchers and
practitioners keen on exploring or applying machine learning
techniques, specifically within the scope of financial sentiment
analysis.
We hope that this contribution will spur further research in
this field, enriching our shared comprehension of the dynamic
interplay between financial news sentiment, AI models, and
market behavior. Detailed information about how to access and
use the dataset is available at Zenodo repository (Fatouros and
Kouroumali, 2023).
3.2. Establishing Baseline: Sentiment Classification using Fin-
BERT
To validate the e ffectiveness of our proposed approach, we
contrast ChatGPT’s performance with a conventional bench-
mark in financial sentiment analysis—FinBERT. Selected for
its exceptional proficiency in classifying sentiments expressed
Figure 5: Sentiment Distribution per Forex Pair
Figure 6: Most Common Tokens on Positive Headlines
in financial texts, FinBERT provides a robust baseline for com-
paring and evaluating our results. By doing so, we aim to
demonstrate the substantial potential of ChatGPT in this spe-
cialized task.
In terms of implementation, we utilized the Transformers
library from Hugging Face to operate FinBERT (Wolf et al.,
2020). This Python-based API provides an intuitive interface
for employing pre-trained transformer models. By leveraging
the convenience and ease of use of the Transformers library,
we efficiently integrated FinBERT into our experiments. This
high-level process involved loading the FinBERT model and
tokenizer from Hugging Face’s model repository, tokenizing
the headlines, and feeding them into the model. The FinBERT
model subsequently outputs a set of probabilities for each sen-
timent class (positive, negative, and neutral), representing the
model’s confidence in associating the input headline with each
sentiment category. These probabilities are used to determine
the predicted class and a sentiment score (notated as FinBERT-
N) for each headline. The sentiment score is computed by sub-

3.3. Exploring Sentiment Classification with ChatGPT
The primary goal of this work is to explore the potential of
ChatGPT in the field of financial sentiment analysis. Given
its extensive training on diverse texts, ChatGPT is expected to
demonstrate an advanced understanding of context, a key factor
in interpreting financial news sentiment. The rationale for uti-
lizing ChatGPT lies in its potential ability to comprehend not
only the literal meanings of words but also the underlying im-
plications, idioms, or sentiments that can be industry-specific or
topic-centric. For example, in the forex market, a piece of newsmight have a positive sentiment for one currency (e.g., JPY) but
a negative sentiment for the corresponding forex pair (e.g., US-
DJPY). This nuanced contextual understanding, crucial to most
sentiment or emotion analysis tasks, is where ChatGPT could
potentially outshine established LMs such as BERT.
To evaluate the capabilities of ChatGPT in financial senti-
ment analysis, we devised and conducted a series of experi-
ments through a zero-shot prompting approach. With zero-shot
prompting, we harness ChatGPT’s pre-existing training and un-
derstanding of language patterns and context to generate de-
sired responses without any task-specific fine-tuning or further
training. This approach allows us to directly evaluate Chat-
GPT’s inherent capabilities in sentiment analysis without any
additional modifications, demonstrating the potential for direct
integration and utilization of ChatGPT in various applications.
Table 3 details the prompts used for sentiment classification.
These prompts range from emulating the perspectives of a fi-
nancial analyst evaluating news (GPT-P1 and P2) to a senti-
ment analysis AI model (such as FinBERT) assessing a head-
line (GPT-P3), a forex trader reacting to market updates (GPT-
P4), as well as a prompt evaluating all the available daily news
per forex pair (GPT-P5) and all available daily news (GPT-P6).
Furthermore, we implemented variations of these prompts re-
quiring numerical sentiment output in the form of a sentiment
score (GPT P1N-P6N) ranging from [ −1,1] instead of a senti-
ment class label. Prompts GPT-P6 and P6N were designed to
ask ChatGPT to process a list of headlines and return a collec-
tive sentiment in a structured format, specifically JSON. This
feature evaluates ChatGPT’s capability to integrate seamlessly
into existing services by producing easily consumable output.
Such a capability is vital in real-world applications where the
model’s results need to be immediately utilized by other ser-
vices or systems.
To conduct these sentiment analysis experiments, we lever-
aged the GPT-3.5-turbo model available from OpenAI’s Python
library (Brown et al., 2020). Each prompt was fed to the model
as a single user instruction. Depending on the prompt, we
fine-tuned several parameters to optimize the model’s output.

for buy, negative for sell, or neutral for hold position.
Specifically, the max tokens parameter in GPT P1-P5 was set
to 1 to constrain the model’s response to a single token. For
prompts GPT P1N-P4N, P5N, P6-P6N, the max tokens param-
eter was set to 10, 20, and 200 tokens respectively, accord-
ing to their expected response length. Consequently, dedicated
processing was performed on the response text to extract the
necessary information per prompt. For instance, we crafted a
straightforward function with a regular expression to extract the
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) from P6’s response. The
temperature parameter was set to 0.2 to guide the model to-
wards generating more deterministic outputs. It’s worth noting
that we ended up with these prompts after extensive prompt en-
gineering to ensure that GPT includes the desired information
(i.e., sentiment class or score) in its responses.
For each prompt, we monitored the time taken to receive a
response from the API to track the task latency and evaluate
GPT’s e fficiency. We also logged the number of tokens used in
the completion and the number of tokens in the prompt for cost
management and resource usage tracking.
Each experiment was run iteratively over the forex dataset
presented in Section 3.1. To ensure the smooth execution of
the iterative process, we incorporated error handling mecha-
nisms to address potential API exceptions or response errors.
It’s essential to note that running these sentiment analysis ex-
periments over large datasets consumes API tokens and incurs
costs in line with OpenAI’s pricing structure. However, the in-
sights obtained from the sentiment analysis greatly outweigh
the computational expenses, o ffering invaluable intelligence for
enhanced decision making in finance.
3.4. Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation approach for sentiment classification in this
study was twofold, encompassing both a traditional evaluation
grounded in the comparison with the true sentiment class and a
market-related model evaluation. The former method focused
on the models that predicted a sentiment class for each headline
(i.e., FinBERT and GPT’s P1-P4), by comparing the predicted
sentiment class with the actual sentiment class as annotated inour dataset. On the other hand, the market-related model eval-
uation was applicable to all considered models, achieved by as-
signing the corresponding integer code to the predicted senti-
ment classes. Specifically for FinBERT, the sentiment score
was derived from the predicted probabilities per class, as de-
tailed in Section 3.2.
3.4.1. Evaluation Based on True Class
To gauge the e ffectiveness of our sentiment classification
models, we devised an evaluation framework rooted in mul-
tiple performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-score. These metrics illuminate the extent to which the
models accurately predict sentiment classes defined in our an-
notated dataset.
A key metric in our evaluation toolbox is the Sentiment Mean
Absolute Error (S-MAE) expressed by Eq. 1, where Nrepre-
sents the total number of instances or data points, yidenotes
the true sentiment class for the i-th instance, and ˆ yirepresents
the predicted sentiment class for the i-th instance. This met-
ric quantifies the mean absolute di fference between the integer-
represented true sentiment classes and the predicted sentiment
classes, with -1, 0, and 1 representing negative, neutral, and
positive sentiments, respectively.
S−MAE =1
NNX
i=1|yi−ˆyi| (1)
The rationale behind utilizing S-MAE is its capacity to dis-
tinctly penalize models that significantly misjudge sentiment
classification. This aspect is particularly important given the
intricate nature of sentiment analysis in financial news, where
sentiment interpretation can be complex and nuanced. For in-
stance, a headline with a positive sentiment towards a particular
currency (e.g., USD) could suggest a negative sentiment for its
paired currency (e.g., EURUSD). In another case, a negative
sentiment towards the economy due to an announcement from
a central bank might convey a positive market sentiment for the
corresponding currency. These subtleties underscore the neces-
7

--- PAGE 9 ---
sity of penalizing not only incorrect polarity predictions but also
off-target intensity estimations.
Moreover, the evaluation includes a comparative analysis
among di fferent models. Specifically, we compare the perfor-
mance of the FinBERT model with that of ChatGPT under vary-
ing prompts (P1-P4). This approach intends to highlight the
impact of prompt selection on the performance of ChatGPT, of-
fering a nuanced understanding of how these di fferent models
perform in sentiment classification tasks.
3.4.2. Model Evaluation in Relation to the Market
Aside from conventional classification metrics, we also eval-
uated the models’ output in connection with actual market re-
turns. This evaluation strategy is driven by the primary intended
application of these models - to guide trading decisions in finan-
cial markets.
For this component of the evaluation, we aggregate the sen-
timent scores for each forex pair on a daily basis. In particular,
the sentiment scores of all headlines concerning a specific forex
pair within a single day are summed to derive a daily sentiment
score. This score is then compared with the actual daily return
of the corresponding forex pair using Pearson correlation. This
correlation is computed to assess whether the sentiment scores,
as predicted by the models, have any relation to real market
movements.
In addition to correlation with market returns, the models are
also evaluated on their ability to accurately predict the direction
of market movement, a critical element in financial decision-
making (Blaskowitz and Herwartz, 2011). This metric, termed
Directional Accuracy (DA), is computed as the percentage of
days where the predicted sentiment direction (positive /negative)
aligns with the actual market return direction. For example, if
the model correctly predicted the direction of market movement
on 65 days out of 100, then the Directional Accuracy of the
model would be 65%.
For the purpose of this market-related evaluation, the senti-
ment score for prompts GPT-P1 to P6 is regarded as an integer
value of the predicted class. This interpretation allows the sen-
timent score to be quantified and aggregated in a way that aligns
with its intended meaning - a measure of the overall daily sen-
timent towards a specific forex pair.
This evaluation includes all models (FinBERT, GPT P1-P6,
and P1N-P6N) and, by combining Directional Accuracy with
Pearson correlation, o ffers a more holistic view of the models’
performance in a financial context.
4. Results
This section details the findings obtained from our extensive
analysis and experiments, aimed at scrutinizing the e ffective-
ness of ChatGPT in financial sentiment analysis. We present a
comprehensive discussion of these results, comparing the per-
formance of the various ChatGPT prompts and the established
baseline, FinBERT, across various metrics.4.1. Sentiment Classification Performance
Table 4 showcases the sentiment classification performance
of various models including FinBERT and distinct prompts
from the ChatGPT (GPT-P1 to P4) used in our dataset. The
evaluation metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-
Score, and S-MAE.
As presented in the table, GPT models consistently outper-
form FinBERT across all metrics. FinBERT, which is a general-
purpose language model trained on financial text, shows an ac-
curacy of 0.561, a precision of 0.560, and a recall of 0.562.
Its F1-Score stands at 0.556 and it yields an S-MAE of 0.540.
Although these figures are decent, they are significantly over-
shadowed by the performance of the GPT models. Interest-
ingly, GPT-P3, which mirrors the FinBERT model in acting as
a sentiment analysis model trained on financial news headlines
performs relatively well. However, it doesn’t match the perfor-
mance of other GPT models that leverage the forex pair infor-
mation in their prompts.
GPT-P1, which is designed to function as a financial expert
performing emotion analysis on headlines while taking into ac-
count the related forex pair, also registers a commendable per-
formance in the sentiment classification task. However, it un-
derperforms slightly compared to GPT-P2, with its metrics trail-
ing by approximately 8%, indicating that while the emotion-
based approach of P1 is e ffective, the sentiment-oriented ap-
proach of P2 appears to o ffer more precision in this context.
GPT-P2, and P4, which act as financial experts consider-
ing the related forex pair in their sentiment analysis, register
substantial improvements in the sentiment classification task.
GPT-P2 leads the pack with the highest accuracy, recall, and
F1-Score around 0.790. GPT-P4, designed to impersonate a
forex trader making trading decisions based on the headline
sentiment, posts similar performance metrics to GPT-P2, de-
spite the di fferent framing of the prompt. This aligns with how
the dataset was annotated, indicating that role-playing prompts,
such as those used in GPT-P4 and GPT-P2, are especially e ffec-
tive.
Table 4: Performance Results in Sentiment Classification
Model Accuracy Precision Recall F1 S-MAE
FinBERT 0.561 0.560 0.562 0.556 0.540
GPT-P1 0.730 0.760 0.730 0.725 0.300
GPT-P2 0.790 0.797 0.790 0.790 0.227
GPT-P3 0.735 0.780 0.735 0.737 0.282
GPT-P4 0.784 0.804 0.784 0.789 0.221
Furthermore, as depicted in Table 5, the performance of the
GPT models varies depending on the specific forex pair. For the
AUDUSD pair, GPT-P2 demonstrates superior performance in
terms of accuracy, recall, F1-score, and S-MAE, while GPT-
P4 outperforms the other models in precision. In the case of
the USDJPY pair, GPT-P2 dominates all performance metrics.
The evaluation of the EURCHF pair reveals a split performance
dominance, with GPT-P2 leading in accuracy, recall, and F1-
score, while GPT-P4 stands out in precision and S-MAE. No-
tably, GPT-P4 dominates in all performance metrics for both
8

the EURUSD and GBPUSD pairs, underlining the e ffective-
ness of GPT-P4 for sentiment analysis specifically associated
with these forex pairs.
Table 5: Best Performing Model in Sentiment Classification per forex pair

EURCHF P2 P4 P2 P2 P4
EURUSD P4 P4 P4 P4 P4
GBPUSD P4 P4 P4 P4 P4
USDJPY P2 P2 P2 P2 P2
However, it’s worth noting that 75.6% of the headlines in
the dataset mention the related forex pair at their beginning.
This observation suggests that the performance di fference be-
tween prompts such as GPT-P1, P2, and P4, which take the
forex pair into account, could be even more pronounced when
dealing with more complex headlines. To explore this, we fur-
ther examined the performance of the models specifically on
a subset of the data with headlines that do not explicitly men-
tion the associated forex pair. This assessment provides insight
into how well each model handles sentiment analysis in a more
challenging context, where the pertinent topic (i.e., forex pair)
is not directly stated in the headline text. The results from this
analysis, presented in Table 6, showed that GPT-P4 continued
to outperform, achieving the highest position across all metrics.
This finding underscores GPT-P4’s ability to interpret the im-
plicit context in the headlines.
On the other hand, FinBERT’s performance slightly declined
when the forex pair was not mentioned directly, with accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score, and S-MAE at 0.543, 0.543, 0.543,
0.538, and 0.539 respectively. GPT-P1, P2, and P3 also expe-
rienced a dip in performance compared to the results from the
complete dataset. However, even with the drop in performance,
GPT-P1, P2, and P3 outperformed FinBERT, underlining the
superiority of the GPT models in handling complex scenarios.
In the case of GPT-P2, despite a decrease in performance, it still
secured high scores with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
and S-MAE at 0.711, 0.728, 0.711, 0.714, and 0.326 respec-
tively, emphasizing its overall robustness in sentiment classifi-
cation.
This analysis highlights the strength of GPT models, particu-
larly GPT-P4, in sentiment analysis tasks. These models’ abil-
ity to maintain a high level of performance even in more chal-
lenging scenarios makes them promising tools for real-world
applications. Crucially, these results also emphasize the impor-
tance of the prompt in instructing ChatGPT. By thoughtfully
crafting prompts based on the specifics of the task at hand, we
can guide the model to leverage its knowledge more e ffectively,
thus enhancing its performance in sentiment analysis.
4.2. Sentiment Score relation to the Financial Market
The second evaluation approach examines how well the sen-
timent scores predicted by each model align with market price
movements. We compare the sentiment scores of each model
against the actual daily returns of the respective forex pairs toTable 6: Performance Results in Sentiment Classification (filtered data)
Model Accuracy Precision Recall F1 S-MAE
FinBERT 0.543 0.543 0.543 0.538 0.539
GPT-P1 0.663 0.715 0.663 0.672 0.410
GPT-P2 0.711 0.728 0.711 0.714 0.326
GPT-P3 0.665 0.657 0.665 0.657 0.384
GPT-P4 0.765 0.772 0.765 0.763 0.249
understand the potential utility of the models in a trading con-
text. This comparison was done in terms of Pearson correlation
and DA as presented in Section 3.
4.2.1. Correlation with Market Returns
The correlation coe fficient between sentiment scores and
market returns is a key factor in evaluating the e ffectiveness
of the presented models. This correlation is measured using
the Pearson correlation coe fficient, which ranges from -1 to
+1. The higher the correlation value, the more directly related
the sentiment scores and market returns are. In this context, a
higher positive correlation implies that as sentiment improves,
market returns also increase. Consequently, the model with the
highest correlation between its sentiment scores and market re-
turns can be considered the most accurate in reflecting the mar-
ket’s response to sentiment changes.
The correlation matrix represented in Figure 8 unveils the
interplay among various models, the annotated sentiment, and
the daily market returns. It is indeed reasonable that GPT-P4
exhibits the highest correlation with the true sentiment, given
that P4 mirrors the approach used in annotating the sentiment
within the dataset. Similarly, FinBERT correlates the most with
GPT-P3 which mimics a sentiment analysis model trained on
financial data. However, a more intriguing observation is that
GPT-P6N demonstrates a higher correlation with the market re-
turns than the true sentiment itself. This underscores the power
of GPT’s ability to process all daily news simultaneously, which
enhances its capacity to gauge market sentiment with a higher
degree of accuracy. Most models generating sentiment scores
ranging from -1 to 1 instead of performing sentiment classifi-
cation exhibit a more fitting alignment with the market move-
ments. This is plausible as the latter models are better posi-
tioned to accurately capture news sentiment that is slightly pos-
itive or negative.
It’s also worth noting that GPT-P5 showed the lowest corre-
lation with both daily returns and true sentiment, indicating that
this prompt may not be as e ffective in sentiment prediction for
market price prediction as the others.
Furthermore, the high correlation between GPT-P1 and P1N,
through to GPT-P6 and P6N, suggests that the di fferent versions
of the models (categorical and numerical (N) versions) largely
agree on the sentiment of the text. This indicates the consis-
tency of the GPT’s outputs.
The correlation between true sentiment and daily returns
stands at around 0.49, implying a moderate linear relationship.
This suggests that sentiment can explain some but not all of the
variations in market prices. Other factors and market dynamics
likely come into play as well.

4.2.2. Directional Accuracy of Sentiment Scores
The tables (7,8) below presents the DA of di fferent sentiment
scoring models. DA reflects the percentage of instances where
the predicted and actual direction of change align, with regards
to sentiment scores and market movements.
Examining the figures, GPT-P1N is found to have the high-
est DA at 67.2%, indicating the superior ability of this model
to predict the correct direction of market movement based on
sentiment scores. Close contenders are GPT-P3N and GPT-
P6N, with DA values around 66%. Among categorical models,
GPT-P5 shows the highest DA, closely followed by GPT-P6 and
GPT-P4. However, the numerical models, in general, tend to
have a higher DA than their categorical counterparts, underlin-
ing their enhanced capacity in capturing the directional changes
in market sentiment.

GPT-P5N 0.623
GPT-P6N 0.652
Table 9 showcases the DA of numerical sentiment analysis
models, broken down per ticker. Observing the results, GPT-
P1N registers the highest DA for AUDUSD and shares the high-
est DA with GPT-P2N for EURCHF. This indicates the superior
ability of GPT-P1N to predict the correct direction of market
movement for these particular currency pairs. Meanwhile, for
EURUSD and GBPUSD, GPT-P6N outperforms the other mod-
els, illustrating its e ffectiveness in predicting market direction
for these tickers. Contrastingly, the FinBERT-N model exhibits
the highest DA for USDJPY , while GPT-P6N, which overall isthe top performing model, fails capture the sentiment of this
specific pair appropriately. This divergence implies that di ffer-
ent models might possess distinct strengths in forecasting dif-
ferent market dynamics, suggesting the necessity of a tailored
approach for each ticker.
Notably, for the EURCHF currency pair, the DA is generally
lower. This might be due to considerable less data being avail-
able for these pair, reinforcing the critical role of ample data
availability in accurate market direction prediction. Further-
more, it’s interesting to observe that GPT-P1N and P3N show
the highest DA for this pair, despite exhibiting poorer results
compared to GPT-P4N and P6N in all the previous evaluations.
Thus, this improved performance for GPT-P1N and P3N might
be coincidental. Nevertheless, the results underline the unpre-
dictable nature of financial markets and emphasize the necessity
of comprehensive testing on diverse datasets for model valida-
tion.

4.2.3. Performance and Cost Analysis
In the context of deploying ML models, particularly in a pro-
duction environment, performance and cost considerations are
crucial. These factors can significantly a ffect the scalability, ef-
ficiency, and overall feasibility of a model. Given this, we eval-
uate the GPT prompts in terms of processing time and token
consumption, both of which directly impact operational costs
and performance. Table 10 provides a summary of the average
processing time and the number of tokens processed by each
prompt.
Table 10: Average Time and Tokens Processed per ChatGPT Prompt
Prompt Pr. time Pr. tokens Hdln. time Hdln. tokens
P1 0.94 63.0 0.94 63.17
P2 0.81 67.0 0.81 67.15
P3 0.97 66.0 0.97 65.91
P4 0.82 84.0 0.82 84.39
P5 0.83 193.0 0.11 24.74
P6 5.99 592.0 0.22 22.22

P4N 1.06 91.0 1.06 90.81
P5N 1.85 201.0 0.24 25.68
P6N 6.10 600.0 0.23 22.54
Among the sentiment classification prompts, P1, P2, and P3
exhibit similar average times and tokens. They produce con-
cise responses in less than a second with around 65 tokens. P4,
10

--- PAGE 12 ---
which is the best performing prompt, generates more tokens,
which can potentially lead to higher costs. On the other hand,
P5 and P6, while generating significantly more tokens, ben-
efit from processing multiple headlines at once, as they have
lower average times and tokens per headline, which in addition
to higher accuracy, can lead to a cost reduction when process-
ing large quantities of data. The prompts generating numerical
outputs follow a similar pattern, but they generally require more
time and tokens due to the complexity of generating more ac-
curate responses.
It is important to note that the processing times mentioned in
the study are dependent on many factors and may not be entirely
consistent. The load on the ChatGPT model, which can vary
depending on the time of day, other global usage patterns, and
end-user location, may significantly impact the processing time.
Thus, the average time taken by the models, as presented in the
results, while informative for relative comparisons, might not
always reflect their real-time performance. Consequently, the
time-related results should be interpreted with caution as they
might not be entirely reliable.
Taking into account that the cost of utilizing the OpenAI
API for the ChatGPT-3.5 model is 0.002 USD per 1K tokens,
the financial implications of integrating ChatGPT into exist-
ing services seem relatively low, especially considering the
volume of data processed daily. As a reference, Bloomberg
News produces approximately 5,000 articles on a daily basis
(Bloomberg, 2023).
To illustrate, let’s consider using the P6N model, which gen-
erates the highest number of tokens among the models tested
in this study. With this model, the daily cost can be calculated
as follows: 600 tokens (average generated by P6N per article)
* 5,000 articles * 0.002 USD per 1K tokens. This calculation
results in a total daily cost of approximately 6 USD.
Hence, even when dealing with substantial data volumes,
such as those reported by Bloomberg, the cost of using ad-
vanced language models like ChatGPT for sentiment analysis
remains reasonably a ffordable. This a ffordability, in combina-
tion with their demonstrated performance, makes these models
a compelling option for real-world financial applications.
However, for applications that require real-time insights and
increased accuracy, a mixed approach combining single and
multiple news analysis might be necessary. This would allow
the flexibility of generating quick and concise responses for in-
dividual headlines with P1-P4 (or P1N-P4N), while also pro-
cessing a larger batch of headlines with P5, P6 (or P5N, P6N)
when time allows.
5. Discussion
5.1. Performance of ChatGPT in Financial Sentiment Analysis
The results of our study reveal that the ChatGPT model con-
sistently outperforms the FinBERT model in financial senti-
ment analysis, regardless of the specific prompt used. In par-
ticular, prompts GPT-P4, P6, P6N showed considerable perfor-
mance in sentiment analysis, providing potentially valuable in-
sights for predicting market behavior. This high performance,combined with the model’s flexibility through prompt engineer-
ing, implies significant potential for fine-tuning and optimiz-
ing the application. For example, through strategic framing of
the task at hand, as demonstrated by prompts GPT4-P4 and P6,
ChatGPT’s accuracy could be further improved. Despite these
promising results, it’s important to note that the e ffectiveness of
these prompts varies, which highlights the potential for further
optimization and underlines the importance of testing on larger
datasets.
Interestingly, GPT-P6N demonstrated a higher correlation
with market returns than the actual sentiment, which hints at
the model’s superior understanding of overall market sentiment
when processing all daily news at once. This could potentially
be due to ChatGPT’s ability to capture more nuanced sentiment
variations across a set of news articles compared to individual
human annotators who are assessing texts independently.
Moreover, models that generate sentiment scores ranging
from -1 to 1 (N versions) showed a higher alignment with mar-
ket movements. This suggests that these models are more adept
at capturing subtle nuances in news sentiment, which might be
more indicative of market trends. Conversely, GPT-P5, despite
processing all daily news per forex pair, showed lower corre-
lation with both market returns and true sentiment, thus em-
phasizing the importance of e ffective prompt engineering and
rigorous evaluation of prompts before deployment.
The robust correlation observed between pairs GPT-P1 and
P1N through to GPT-P6 and P6N further underscores the con-
sistency and reliability of GPT’s outputs, marking them as
promising candidates for real-world applications.
5.2. Potential Applications in Financial Services
The findings of our study lend themselves to several prac-
tical applications in the financial services sector. With strate-
gic prompt selection, the application of models like ChatGPT
for financial sentiment analysis can o ffer actionable insights for
predicting market trends. It is important to remember, though,
that the choice of the ideal prompt could vary depending on the
specific use case, the financial instrument under study, and the
tolerance for prediction inaccuracies.
However, it’s also crucial to clarify that the observed align-
ment between model sentiment scores and market movements
does not necessarily imply predictive power over future price
movements. Financial markets are complex systems influenced
by a wide array of factors, including macroeconomic indicators,
geopolitical events, and technical aspects. Recognizing this, a
similar methodology to the one presented in this work could be
applied with a more comprehensive set of input data. Instead
of feeding the model with solely domain-specific news head-
lines, other relevant information such as economic indicators
and additional market data could be included in the prompts,
potentially yielding even richer insights. Therefore, while sen-
timent analysis using language models like ChatGPT can con-
tribute valuable perspectives, they should be integrated into a
more holistic approach to financial market analysis for optimum
utility.
11

--- PAGE 13 ---
5.3. Limitations and Future Work
While our study reveals encouraging results, it also high-
lights some of the limitations of ChatGPT and suggests direc-
tions for future research. For instance, despite demonstrating
substantial correlation with market sentiment, the models didn’t
entirely align with the market movements, indicating that sen-
timent only explains a part of the variations in market prices.
This observation is an important reminder of the multifaceted
nature of financial markets and points towards potential avenues
for future research to further enhance these models.
As the landscape of LLMs continues to evolve with remark-
able speed, it is imperative that future research delves into the
comparison and assessment of the unique capabilities of both
existing and emerging models. For instance, newer models such
as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) hold potential to enhance the perfor-
mance exhibited by ChatGPT in our study. Furthermore, with
the availability of open-source LLMs like BLOOM, a thorough
evaluation of these models, their suitability for financial senti-
ment analysis, and their potential integration with commercial
systems could prove to be a promising avenue of research. This
continuous exploration of advancements in LLMs is necessary
to fully leverage their potential in the dynamic and complex
field of financial services.
In terms of processing time, further extensive testing under
varied conditions is necessary to establish more accurate and
consistent measures of response time. For operational appli-
cations that utilize LLMs services, such as the ChatGPT API,
it would be advisable to have mechanisms in place to accom-
modate potential variations in response time due to factors like
fluctuations in system load.
Taken together, the findings of our study underline the sig-
nificant potential of ChatGPT in financial sentiment analysis.
By pursuing the areas of future work identified here, we can
move towards creating more sophisticated and accurate senti-
ment analysis models for financial markets.
6. Conclusion
This work has explored the potential and adaptability of
LLMs, specifically ChatGPT 3.5, in the challenging realm
of financial sentiment analysis, focusing on the forex market.
We employed a zero-shot prompting approach to evaluate the
model’s capacity to interpret and generate meaningful senti-
ment scores from financial text, bypassing the need for domain-
specific fine-tuning. Our thorough examination was grounded
in a meticulously curated and annotated dataset of forex-related
news headlines, which we have made publicly available, pro-
viding a valuable resource to spur further research and innova-
tion in the field.
Our evaluation, which extends beyond conventional metrics,
revealed that prompts that accurately frame the intended task
(short-term sentiment classification) show significant potential
in understanding market behavior. This approach has demon-
strated performance that exceeds that of FinBERT, which is an
established model in the domain. Furthermore, our study un-
derscored the critical importance of strategic prompt selectionto enhance the performance and e fficiency of sentiment analysis
tasks, with ChatGPT demonstrating robustness and consistency
across prompts.
However, while these results provide a promising outlook for
the application of ChatGPT in financial sentiment analysis, they
also suggest areas for further investigation. For instance, the
superior understanding of overall market sentiment exhibited
by prompts processing all daily news at once opens a pathway
for future research exploring the integration of additional types
of relevant financial data within the prompt.
In the broader landscape of AI tools in finance, our findings
further substantiate the relevance and potential of LLMs. With
the steady progress in this field, we anticipate more refined and
robust models such as the GPT4, which could further enhance
the performance of financial sentiment analysis.
While our study sheds light on the immense potential of
LLMs in financial sentiment analysis, the path to real-world
application is not without its challenges. Future work should
look into addressing the varying time performance under di ffer-
ent load conditions, establishing more accurate and consistent
model performances.
In conclusion, our work contributes to a burgeoning field,
offering a comprehensive evaluation of ChatGPT’s application
in financial sentiment analysis, and demonstrating its potential
as a valuable tool in the realm of finance. We hope that our
findings and the released dataset will serve as a springboard for
further advancements in this domain. The exploration and re-
