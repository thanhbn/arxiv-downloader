Abstract
We introduce FinTral , a suite of state-of-the-
art multimodal large language models (LLMs)
built upon the Mistral-7b model and tailored
for financial analysis. FinTral integrates tex-
tual, numerical, tabular, and image data. We
present FinSet , the largest financial LLM pre-
training training, instruction tuning and finan-
cial alignment dataset and evaluation bench-
mark featuring nine tasks and 23 datasets and
the first to understand and mitigate financial hal-
lucinations. We enhance FinTral with domain-
specific pretraining, instruction fine-tuning, and
RLAIF training by exploiting a large collection
of textual and visual datasets we curate for this
work. Our FinTral model trained with direct
preference optimization employing advanced
Tools and Retrieval methods, dubbed FinTral-
DPO-T&R , demonstrates an exceptional zero-
shot performance. It outperforms ChatGPT-3.5
in all tasks and surpasses GPT-4 in five out
of nine tasks, marking a significant advance-
ment in AI-driven financial technology. We
also demonstrate that FinTral has the poten-
tial to excel in real-time analysis and decision-
making in diverse financial contexts. The
GitHub repository for FinTral is available at
https://github.com/UBC-NLP/fintral .
1 Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a key
role in financial document analysis, interpretation,
and utilization. In recent years, a wide range of
applications incorporating advances in NLP have
emerged. These include sentiment analysis of fi-
nancial news, event extraction from financial doc-
uments, and the generation and summarization of
financial reports (Souma et al., 2019; Araci, 2019;
Yang et al., 2018). These developments have un-
covered the potential for unstructured data for data-
driven financial decision-making and the transfor-
mation of financial documents into actionable in-
sights and market intelligence. Applying NLP in
Figure 1: Comparative Performance Analysis on text-
based tasks of Key Financial AI Models. We compare
three variations of FinTral with ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)
and GPT-4 across seven task clusters: Sentiment Anal-
ysis (SA), Named Entity Recognition (NER), Number
Understanding (NU), Text Summarization (TS), Stock
Movement Prediction (SMP), Credit Scoring (CS), and
Firm Disclosure (FD).
finance, however, is challenging because financial
documents often include dense numerical infor-
mation and domain-specific jargon requiring ad-
vanced numerical processing and reasoning capa-
bilities (Mik, 2017; Liu et al., 2023b). This means
that financial NLP models need extensive domain
knowledge before they can capture the nuanced
implications of accounting and financial measures,
economic indicators, and market trends. This is
also compounded by the rapid pace of financial
markets, where real-time analysis is crucial but
challenging to achieve (Gupta, 2023; Yang et al.,
2023b).
Similar to other domains, large language models
(LLMs) are starting to disrupt financial documentarXiv:2402.10986v3  [cs.CL]  14 Jun 2024

understanding (Chapman et al., 2022; La Quatra
and Cagliero, 2020) but can also suffer from the
same issues as transitional approaches. LLMs are
also prone to hallucination, reducing their usability
in financial decision-making (Kang and Liu, 2023).
Financial documents can also involve various types
of visual content, which require models with multi-
modal abilities.
To meet these challenges, we introduce a ground-
breaking LLM specialising in the financial domain.
Our model, dubbed FinTral , is designed to over-
come hurdles of the financial domain through a
multimodal approach that integrates textual, numer-
ical, tabular, and visual data processing for com-
prehensive document understanding. We train our
model off Mistral-7b (Jiang et al., 2023) on a size-
able domain-specific dataset and instruction-tune it
for the financial domain using extensive instruction
data. We then carefully align it with GPT-4 gener-
ated responses leveraging the recently introduced
direct policy optimization (DPO) method (Rafailov
et al., 2023). In order to evaluate FinTral, we in-
troduce an extensive benchmark of eight different
tasks based on 25 different datasets. Our model
outperforms all other models of comparable size
and, in spite of its much smaller size, performs on
par with GPT-4.
To summarize, we offer the following contri-
butions: (1)We introduce FinTral a cutting-edge
multimodal LLM specialized in financial data, and
FinSet, an extensive financial LLM training and
evaluation benchmark. FinSet is the largest fi-
nancial evaluation benchmark and the only one
that measures model hallucinations, encompass-
ing nine tasks across 25 datasets. (2)FinTrals fur-
ther instruction-finetuned and carefully aligned us-
ing the DPO objective, using AI feedback data,
resulting in FinTralDPO .(3)We have also en-
dowed FinTral with vision capabilities, extending
it toFinTralVL , which employs the CLIP (Radford
et al., 2021) vision encoder. For enhanced perfor-
mance, we developed a version that utilizes Tools
andRetrieval, FinTralDPO-T&R .(4)FinTralDPO
demonstrates exceptional zero-shot capabilities,
outperforming ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a) in all
tasks. Moreover, our best model, FinTralDPO-
T&R, surpasses GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b) in five
of eight text-based tasks.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In
Section 2, we review related work with a particu-
lar emphasis on financial LLMs, their applications
and challenges. Section 3 outlines how we builtour benchmark dataset: FinSet. We present our
approach to model pretraining, instruction tuning,
and prompting strategies, and subsequently intro-
duce FinTral models in Section 4. In Section 5, we
present our experiments and comprehensively anal-
yse our models. We discuss our results in Section 6
and conclude in Section 7. Finally, we discuss limi-
tations in Section 8 and provide an ethics statement
in Section 9.
2 Related Works
NLP for finance Traditional NLP has been ap-
plied to various finance tasks, including named
entity recognition, sentiment analysis, event ex-
traction, financial report generation, and text sum-
marization (Salinas Alvarado et al., 2015; Souma
et al., 2019; Araci, 2019; Yang et al., 2018; Zheng
et al., 2019; Chapman et al., 2022; La Quatra and
Cagliero, 2020). However, traditional models face
challenges in this domain due to complexity of
financial language, scarcity of annotated data, lim-
ited inferential capabilities, and the need for real-
time analysis. Adaptability of conventional NLP
models is also limited, with such models often opti-
mized for single-task functions (Mik, 2017; Mishra
et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023b).
Financial LLMs Advancements in financial mod-
els began with FinBERT (Araci, 2019). Recently,
models like BloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023),
PIXIU (Xie et al., 2023), Instruct-FinGPT (Zhang
et al., 2023a), and GPT-FinRE (Rajpoot and Parikh,
2023) are notable contributions. Other innovations
include introduction of multimodal capabilities
(FinVis-GPT (Wang et al., 2023b)), enhancement
of investment strategies (GPT-InvestAR (Gupta,
2023), InvestLM (Yang et al., 2023b)), and ef-
forts to address challenges such as economic sen-
timent analysis and hallucination in information
extraction (Zhang et al., 2023b; Sarmah et al.,
2023). FinLMEval (Guo et al., 2023) and DISC-
FinLLM (Chen et al., 2023) focus on evaluation
and model performance in monetary scenarios.
Other work, such as Chu et al. (2023), empha-
sizes sophisticated data preprocessing for better
handling of financial tasks. Appendix A provides a

rich in domain-specific tokens, setting a solid foun-
dation for model training, then our instruction fine-
tuning and AI-driven feedback datasets. Subse-
quently, we present a multi-modal financial dataset
to facilitate a nuanced approach to data interpre-
tation. Finally, we introduce an extensive set of
evaluation benchmark datasets tailored to test the
modelâ€™s performance across diverse financial tasks.
3.1 Pretraining Dataset
We introduce FinSet, a 20 billion token, high qual-
ity dataset we build for financial LLM training. Fin-
Set is acquired based on a collection of large text
corpora (2.9 billion documents, making 135 billion
tokens; see Table 1) from which we extract finance-
specific data that we then clean using a careful
filtering pipeline. The datasets are described in
Appendix B. Our cleaning pipeline is detailed in
Appendix C and is further illustrated in Figure 3.
Our document cutoff date is August 1, 2023, which
affords recent information to our models.

3.2 Financial Instruction Data
We assemble an extensive collection of instruction
tuning datasets to enhance capabilities of our mod-
els. The datasets originate from various sources,
notably including interactions with GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4 for a diverse host of tasks. Again, we apply
a deduplication and filtering pipeline (detailed in
Appendix C) to exclude non-financial instructions,
thereby focusing solely on financial reasoning. Ta-

3.3 Financial AI Feedback Data
Human feedback is valuable for aligning LLMs.
Traditionally, this feedback is derived from human
preferences as to the quality of LLM responses.
In this work, we employ AI feedback through a
refined version of the finance reasoning instruction
dataset described in Section 3.2.
Along with the output generated by GPT-4 (Ope-
nAI, 2023c), we generate responses using the
FinMA-7B (Xie et al., 2023) and LLaMa-7B-
chat (Touvron et al., 2023) models to each prompt.
For a given prompt, the GPT-4 output is selected
as the â€˜chosenâ€™ response while we select randomly
one from FinMA-7B and LLaMa outputs as the
â€˜rejectedâ€™ response. Our AI feedback data includes
a total of 43k samples, and we show an example of
this data in Figure D.5.
3.4 Visual Financial Instruction Dataset
For aligning the vision language components in Fin-
Tral, we use LAION, CC, and SBU datasets from
the Llava pretraining data (Liu et al., 2023a). We
also use the ChartQA training set (Masry et al.,
2022) for the same purpose. In addition, we follow
the same approach by Wang et al. (2023b) to fur-
ther expand our visual pretraining dataset. While
Wang et al. (2023b) use Chinese data, we use the
Fortune-500 companies stock price data, allowing
us to create our own English dataset, dubbed FinVis-
PT. We then use LLava Instruct data to improve the
instruction understanding of our multimodal LLMs,
creating our instruction tuning dataset FinVis-IT .

While the FinVis-PT dataset includes stock mar-
ket charts and asks simple questions about them,
FinVis-IT is multi-turn and includes more com-
plex charts and instructions. Our visual instruction
datasets are described in Table 3.

3.5 Downstream Evaluation Datasets
A diverse array of downstream datasets is crucial
for effective LLM performance benchmarking. In
this work, we develop an extensive benchmark us-
ing existing and new datasets to evaluate our mod-
els. Our benchmark covers the following tasks:
(1) chart understanding (CU), (2) sentiment analy-
sis (SA), (3) named entity recognition (NER), (4)
number understanding (NU), (5) text summariza-
tion (TS), (6) stock movement prediction (SMP),
(7) credit scoring (CS), (8) firm disclosure (FD),
and (9) hallucination analysis (HI). Table 4 summa-
rizes all the datasets used in our evaluation, each
along with the corresponding evaluation metric em-
ployed. We also provide more details about the
datasets in Appendix D.

We use Mistral-7B-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2023) as our
base model for further development, due to its
strong performance and employment of a BPE to-

kenizer that segments numbers into single digits,
which is suitable for numerical tasks.
Domain-Specific Pretraining We further pretrain
Mistral-7B-v0.1 on our 20 billion token FinSet fi-
nancial data described in Section 3. We perform
pretraining with flash attention 2 (Dao, 2023). We
employ a sequence length of up to 8k tokens, thus
accommodating long financial documents. We use
LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) for pretraining and train
the model for one epoch with a learning rate of
2.5eâˆ’5. Pretraining takes 80 hours on four 40GB
A100 GPUs.
Prompting for Financial LLMs We employ a
prompting method suited for a financial LLM with
multimodal capabilities. The model is assigned a

memetic proxy (Reynolds and McDonell, 2021) as
a financial expert signifying key expected behav-
iors, encouraged to think step by step, and that con-
sider diverse inputs which may be texts, tables, or
images. This is followed by a strategic retrieval of
pertinent information, ensuring the modelâ€™s focus
aligns with the queryâ€™s requirements. The model
then engages with a task-based question, demand-
ing an application of the modelâ€™s financial expertise
and analytical thinking. This structured approach
is pivotal in eliciting focused answers from the
model, especially in complex financial scenarios.
The application of constraints further refines the
modelâ€™s output, leading to enhanced accuracy and
context-appropriate responses. A visual representa-
tion of FinTralâ€™s prompting method is depicted in
Figure 5.
Instruction Tuning We use our instruction tuning
dataset described in section 3.2 to perform instruc-
tion finetuning on our pretrained model.1We adopt
QLoRA to perform instruction finetuning using all
the linear layers as target modules as this gives
us a performance that is close to full fine-tuning
(Dettmers et al., 2023).
Alignment with AI Feedback Large language
models may fail to respond well to natural prompts
even after instruction fine-tuning. To address this
challenge, we use direct preference optimization
1We standardize all the datasets to have the same format
of prompting, as explained earlier.
You are a financial expert specializing in the nuanced analysis
of financial statements and a wide array of data-driven financial
tasks. For each prompt you are given, think step by step. Some-
times, you must extract relevant information to proceed with the
problem.

(DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) which allows us to
preferentially tune the model without the usage of
a reward model. Tunstall et al. (2023) introduces
a method to use LoRA to train LLMs using DPO
objective. This is known as distilled direct pref-
erence optimization (dDPO).2We describe how
we generate the binarized preference data for this
process in Section 3.3.
Multimodal Instruction Tuning Once we teach
our model to handle various financial queries, we
also empower it with visual understanding. This is
done using the architecture suggested by Liu et al.
2We use the scripts provided by Tunstall et al. (2023) to
train our dDPO model.

(2023a). Specifically, we add an <image> token
to our prompt and replace the <image> token with
its image embedding after tokenization. We use a
CLIP model (Radford et al., 2021) as our vision
encoder and a 2-layer MLP visual abstractor, allow-
ing us to convert image inputs into text embeddings
fed to the LLM.
Tool Usage In addressing the inherent challenges
faced by LLMs in dealing with quantitative tasks,
we integrate tools (Schick et al., 2023) to our model.
These tools enable the LLM to offload mathemat-
ically intensive tasks to a more suitable computa-
tional environment. For instance, functions such
asAdd() ,Subtract() , and Multiply() are used
by model to generate outputs in a structured format
interpretable as Python function calls, thereby en-
hancing model accuracy in financial applications.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) As
shown in Zhang et al. (2023b) for financial sen-
timent analysis, using retrieval augmented gener-
ation (RAG) can significantly boost performance.
To better facilitate our tool usage and, in some
cases, text extraction from complex data, we de-
ploy a RAG system employing the BGE (Xiao et al.,
2023) models, which are SoTA for document re-
trieval. This is useful for LLMs since users com-
monly ask out-of-domain questions. We use 30,000
financial documents derived from multiple sources
covering January 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023.
We use the chain of retrieval, as shown in Figures
D.3 and its example is provided in Figure D.4.
5 Experiments
We conducted multiple experiments to illustrate
the efficacy of the methods described in section 4.
We evaluated our model on the downstream tasks
described in section 3.5. Symbols in the following
tables indicate the types of models: â™£,â™ ,â™¢,â™¡,
â‹†and,â– represent the pre-trained model, the fine-
tuned model, the instruction fine-tuned model, the
RL-Tuned Models, tools, and retrieval, respectively.
We then performed a hallucination index accuracy
check to assess how well our model mitigates one
of the biggest challenges for LLMs.
We introduce three versions of our model.
Firstly, FinTral-INST is our instruction-fine-tuned
model obtained by fine-tuning our pre-trained
model. Note that we do not assess the performance
of the pre-trained model as it serves as an inter-
mediate step to the instruction fine-tuning model.
Secondly, We introduce FinTral-DPO, which hasbeen further trained based on FinTral-INST uti-
lizing reinforcement learning using AI feedback
with the dDPO objective. Then, we introduce our
FinTral-DPO-T&R, which combines the FinTral-
DPO with tools and retrieval.
We also compare performance of our models to
nine other baselines LLMs. These are LLama-2
(Touvron et al., 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023),
three versions of FinMA (Xie et al., 2023), Vicuna
(Chiang et al., 2023), ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a),
GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023c).
5.1 Instruction Tuning and Model Alignment
As seen from Table 5, our instruction fine-tuned
model FinTral-INST outperforms all pretrained and
fine-tuned open-source models with an average
score of 0.49. One of the causes of concern here is
the tasks that require a specific format as the output,
like the numerical understanding and NER tasks.
We see that in some instances, the model struggles
to follow instructions and often deviates from what
the task asks for.
Furthermore, models that have undergone rein-
forcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), like
FinTral-DPO, ChatGPT, and GPT-4, show even
more marked improvements. Adding RLAIF dra-
matically boosts performance to the average score
of 0.59, resulting in FinTral-DPO outperforming
ChatGPT.
GPT-4, in particular, stands out with the highest
average score, indicating its robust performance
across a diverse set of tasks. Its high NER, NU,
and FD scores suggest exceptional capabilities in
understanding complex text, identifying specific
entities, and interpreting numerical data.
5.2 Retrieval and Tools Usage
As detailed in section 4, the use of retrieval and
tools plays a pivotal role in enhancing the capabil-
ities of our model, FinTral-DPO-T&R, similar to
their impact on GPT-4. Integrating these features
into these models allows the models to access a
broader range of information and apply more spe-
cialized processing techniques, leading to signifi-
cant improvements in performance across various
tasks. In the case of FinTral-DPO-T&R, combin-
ing the FinTral-DPO model with retrieval and tool
capabilities has proven particularly effective. The
FinTral-DPO modelâ€™s ability to follow instruction
prompts accurately enables seamless integration
with external tools and retrieval data. The perfor-

mance of GPT-4-Turbo, with its latest update incor-
porating tools and retrieval, is also noteworthy.
In 5 downstream tasks, FinTral-DPO-T&R out-
performed GPT-4, while GPT-4 surpassed FinTral-
DPO-T&R in two downstream tasks. Since GPT-4
has done exceptionally well in those two tasks, its
average performance is slightly better than FinTral-
DPO-T&R (0.72 vs. 0.70, as shown in table 6).
The edge that FinTral-DPO-T&R and GPT-4 have
over other models is a testament to the potential
of combining sophisticated AI models with addi-
tional data and tool integration for more refined
and accurate outputs.
5.3 Multimodal Evaluation
To evaluate our financial multimodal model, we
use ChartQA and our FinVis datasets. We com-
pare various state-of-the-art multimodal large lan-
guage models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4V (OpenAI,
2023b), Gemini-Pro (Team et al., 2023), Qwen-
VL-Plus (Bai et al., 2023), LLaVa-NEXT (Liu
et al., 2024), and our FinTral-VL model which
comprises of CLIP and FinTral-DPO. As Table 7
shows, GPT-4V performs best, with scores of 0.79
in ChartQA and 0.89 in FinVis, averaging 0.84.
Gemini-Pro follows closely, with a consistent per-
formance across both datasets, scoring an average
of 0.78. Other models like Qwen-VL-Plus, FinTral-
VL, and LLaVa-NEXT show varying degrees of
efficacy: Qwen-VL-Plus performing notably better
in ChartQA (0.78) than in FinVQA (0.64), while
FinTral-VL and LLaVa-NEXT trail behind, indi-
cating areas for potential improvement in their vi-
sual data interpretation capabilities. FinTral-VLperforms well on the FinVQA dataset, making it
highly suited for multimodal financial usage. Fig-
ure D.6 shows examples of modelsâ€™ outputs on
questions from the FinVQA dataset.
5.4 Financial Hallucination Evaluation
Since financial hallucinations can be complex to
measure, we have used three different methods
and datasets to quantify hallucinations. We first
assess how much models hallucinate in selecting
definitions of financial terms. We then conduct
human evaluations of the appropriateness of re-
sponses from top LLM models based on our first
task. Finally, we evaluated them on the Finance
Bench (Islam et al., 2023) dataset, a complex nu-
merical question-answering dataset requiring math-
ematical tools and retrieval.
FinTerms-MCQ In FinTerms-MCQ dataset, we
convert definitions of financial terms from Investo-
pedia (2024) to a multiple choice format using the
right definition and three other closely related defi-
nitions. We then ask the models to select the right
definition. We derive a hallucinations index (HI),
defined as the proportion of correctly generated
definitions by each model (higher is better), based
on the modelsâ€™ performance in this MCQ task. As
seen in Table 8, the modelsâ€™ performances on the
HI vary significantly. GPT-4 and ChatGPT lead the
pack with exceptionally high scores of 98% and
95%, respectively. All three of our models perform
better than the other open-source LLMs. In particu-
lar, FinTral-DPO-T&R show a strong performance
with an HI of 97%.

ple of how popular LLMs, like ChatGPT, hallu-
cinate in the financial domain. We generate an-
swers to questions related to the financial terms
in the FinTerms-Gen dataset (n=150, see Table 4)
using the three models with best performance on
FinTerms-MCQ (i.e, GPT-4, ChatGPT, and FinTral-DPO+T&R). We then ask two humans, each with
at least four years of background in finance, to label
the responses with one of the four correctness tags
shown in Figure 6. The two annotators agree with
a Cohenâ€™s kappa ( K) of0.85. As Figure 63shows
our FinTral-DPO-T&R produces more correct and
satisfying responses (category A in Figure 6) than
ChatGPT but falls short of GPT-4.

Tral: is our FinTral-DPO-T&R. Each bar is segmented
into four colors representing the quality of responses:

Finance Bench Finance Bench (Islam et al., 2023)
is a proprietary dataset designed to assess the capa-
bilities of LLMs in the context of open-book finan-
cial question answering (QA). While the full ver-
sion includes 10,231 questions related to publicly
traded companies, each accompanied by evidence
strings and relevant answers, we evaluate our mod-
els using FinanceBenchâ€™s open-source sample of
150 questions as provided in Islam et al. (2023) us-
ing the same methodology adopted by the authors.
As presented in Figure 7, the FinTral-DPO-T&R
performs very well on this dataset, outperforming
the other models, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023c), Claude
(Models, 2023), and Llama-70B (Touvron et al.,
2023), evaluated in Islam et al. (2023). Using re-
trieval and tools in FinTral-DPO-T&R proves its

efficiency and puts the model ahead of all the other
models.

6 Discussion
Advancements in financial LLMs FinTral lever-
ages extensive datasets and diverse training meth-
ods, including instruction fine-tuning and RLAIF,
to enhance its analysis of complex financial data
across multiple modalities. The integration of ad-
vanced tools further augment its financial capabili-
ties.
Reducing model hallucinations FinTral combats
financial hallucinations by pretraining with up-to-
date, clean financial data and employing RLAIF
and retrieval methods, enhancing model accuracy
and reliability.
Human-AI collaboration in financial decision-
making Enhancing FinTralâ€™s real-time adaptability
to financial markets through dynamic data retrieval
and live data analysis can significantly boost its
predictive accuracy and assist in informed decision-
making. Figure E.1 shows how this model can be
used in real world.
6.1 Model Shortcomings Analysis
Each iteration of FinTral was designed to progres-
sively address the shortcomings of its predecessors,
focusing on enhancing financial domain-specific
knowledge and instruction compliance while mini-
mizing the occurrence of hallucinations.
The initial versions, starting from Mistral-7B
and the subsequent FinTral, showed improved do-
main knowledge but struggled with maintaininginstruction accuracy and often produced mislead-
ing outputs. FinTral-INST, despite advancements,
continued to face challenges in adhering to spe-
cific task formats and response coherence. This
was partly mitigated in FinTral-DPO, which better
adhered to the instructed formats by introducing
direct preference optimization.
The most advanced iteration, FinTral-DPO-
T&R, integrates tools and retrieval capabilities to
further refine performance, especially in complex
financial tasks requiring extensive data integration
and computational power. This version demon-
strates substantial improvements in handling de-
tailed financial analyses and proves highly compet-
itive, even with leading models like GPT-4, par-
ticularly in domains requiring rigorous financial
insight.
7 Conclusion
We presented FinTral an advanced multimodal fi-
nancial language model with remarkable capabili-
ties. Key advancements include integrating textual,
numerical, and visual data, a training pipeline with
various finetuning capabilities, and employment of
tools and retrieval mechanisms. The model effec-
tively addresses challenges like financial halluci-
nation, evidenced by high performance in various
financial tasks compared to baseline models. The
achievements of FinTral hold a great potential for
financial models of a moderate size (e.g., 7B).
8 Limitations
While FinTral represents a significant advancement
in the realm of financial large language models
(LLMs), it is important to acknowledge inherent
limitations:
1.Domain-Specific Adaptability: Tailored for
the financial domain, FinTral may not perform
as effectively outside its trained scope, poten-
tially limiting its generalizability.
2.Handling of Real-Time Data: While de-
signed for real-time analysis, the modelâ€™s pre-
dictive accuracy depends on the timeliness
and accuracy of incoming data, which may
be affected by rapidly changing market condi-
tions.
3.Maintenance and Updating: Continuous up-
dating and maintenance are required to keep
the model relevant and effective in evolving
financial markets and regulations.

--- PAGE 10 ---
Acknowledging these limitations is crucial for
the responsible deployment and continued develop-
ment of FinTral and similar financial LLMs.
9 Ethics Statement
Energy Efficiency. Our FinTral models, similar to
many large language models (LLMs), required sig-
nificant training time and computational resources,
and thus are not particularly energy efficient. We
acknowledge this as a critical issue and advocate
for ongoing research into developing more energy-
efficient models.
Data. Our pretraining datasets are collected from
public domains, encompassing a wide range of fi-
nancial topics and sources. While these datasets
provide comprehensive coverage for financial lan-
guage modelling, we must be aware of the potential
biases and limitations inherent in publicly available
data, ensuring our model remains as objective and
unbiased as possible.
Data Copyright. We emphasize that all datasets
used, including those from SEC filings, news
sources, and social media, are collected from pub-
licly available sources. We confirm that our data
collection process respects the copyrights of these
sources and does not infringe upon any proprietary
data.
Model Release. We are considering releasing our
models and evaluation data (FinSET) responsibly.
Given the sensitive nature of financial data and
the potential for misuse, we will implement strict
guidelines and conditions for the use of FinTral,
particularly in real-world applications. This in-
cludes clear guidelines on ethical usage and the
avoidance of deployment in contexts that could
lead to unethical practices such as market manipu-
lation or privacy violations.
Privacy. FinTral is developed using publicly avail-
able data, which mitigates concerns regarding per-
sonal information leakage. However, given the sen-
sitive nature of financial data, we have taken extra
precautions to ensure that no identifiable personal
or corporate financial information is retrievable
from our trained models.
Human Annotation. The human annotators in-
volved in this project are professionals with ex-
pertise in finance and natural language processing.
No sensitive or personally identifiable data was
used in the annotation process, adhering to ethical
guidelines and data privacy standards. The human
annotators are co authors on this paper.Bias Analysis. We recognize that any language
model can inadvertently perpetuate biases present
in its training data. In FinTralâ€™s case, potential bi-
ases might be related to financial markets, regions,
or corporate entities. We conducted thorough anal-
ysis to identify and mitigate such biases, ensuring
that our modelâ€™s outputs are as fair and unbiased
as possible. However, users should remain aware
of these potential biases, especially when applying
the model to real-world scenarios.
Applications. While FinTral offers advanced ca-
pabilities for financial analysis, like any powerful
tool, it can be misused. Itâ€™s crucial to emphasize re-
sponsible usage, particularly in sensitive financial
contexts. Users should avoid deploying FinTral
for speculative trading, market manipulation, or
any activity that could contravene financial regu-
lations or ethical standards. Conversely, FinTral
has the potential for beneficial applications such
as financial education, research, and improving the
accessibility of financial information.
AI usage. Itâ€™s pertinent to acknowledge the role of
AI tools such as ChatGPT in our project. Specifi-
cally, ChatGPT was utilized minimally and primar-
ily for grammar corrections in our documents. This
use was strictly confined to enhancing linguistic ac-
curacy and improving the readability of our written
materials. Itâ€™s important to clarify that the core re-
search, analysis, and development were conducted
independently by our team.

A Detailed Related Works
Financial NLP Models and Their Challenges
There have been successful applications of tradi-
tional Natural Language Processing (NLP) tech-
niques a range of finance related problems. These
include named entity recognition (Salinas Alvarado
et al., 2015) sentiment analysis of financial news
(Souma et al., 2019; Araci, 2019), event extraction
(Yang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2019), generating
financial reports (Chapman et al., 2022), and text
summarization in a financial context (La Quatra
and Cagliero, 2020).
However, deploying NLP models for domain-
specific tasks in the financial sector faces several
distinct challenges. Firstly, the complex and jargon-
rich nature of financial language poses a significant
barrier in achieving desirable performance from
the models, often leading to a gap in understanding
the domain-specific documents (Mik, 2017). Sec-
ondly, the scarcity of annotated datasets, combined
with the high costs associated with data annotation,
in finance, hinders the advancement of these mod-
els. Thirdly, existing NLP models often fall short
in inferential capabilities, particularly in critical
tasks such as risk assessment and making informed
decision-making in investment contexts (Liu et al.,
2023b). Additionally, the dynamic nature of finan-
cial markets requires models to be capable of real-
time analysis, a feature that many current models
do not possess. Numerical information processing,
a common element in financial documents filled
with figures and symbols, also poses a significant
challenge for understanding financial documents.
The challenge is further exacerbated by the fact that
many graphs and figures are in image formats in
these documents. Lastly, the wide-spread adaptabil-
ity of many NLP models remains limited, as they
are typically optimized for a particular single-task
function and lack the ability to generalize across
multiple tasks (Mishra et al., 2021). In light of
these challenges, it is imperative for ongoing re-
search efforts to develop more advanced, versatile,
and robust NLP models tailored to the dynamic
and complex requirements for financial document
undertanding.
Financial Large Language Models Finance has
witnessed significant advancements in large lan-
guage models, starting with the introduction of
FinBERT (Araci, 2019). This early contributionsets a precedence for using pre-trained language
models in financial sentiment analysis, demonstrat-
ing marked improvements in performance metrics.
In 2023, a series of groundbreaking models have
further propelled the field. BloombergGPT (Wu
et al., 2023) emerged as a 50-billion parameter
model trained on an extensive financial data corpus.
Its training on a diverse dataset enabled it to excel
in financial tasks while maintaining robust perfor-
mance in general LLM benchmarks. PIXIU (Xie
et al., 2023) followed, presenting a comprehensive
framework with a financial LLM fine-tuned with
instruction data. PIXIU was a crucial development
in advancing the open-source development of finan-
cial AI, combining a novel instruction dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for financial LLMs. The
same year saw the introduction of Instruct-FinGPT
(Zhang et al., 2023a), which utilized instruction tun-
ing to enhance financial sentiment analysis. This
model particularly excelled in scenarios requiring
deep numerical understanding and contextual com-
prehension. Another significant advancement was
GPT-FinRE (Rajpoot and Parikh, 2023), focusing
on financial relation extraction using in-context
learning. This model demonstrated high effective-
ness and accuracy by employing two distinct re-
trieval strategies. Adding to the multimodal ca-
pabilities in financial LLMs, FinVis-GPT (Wang
et al., 2023b) was proposed, designed explicitly for
financial chart analysis. This model leveraged the
power of LLMs along with instruction tuning and
multimodal capabilities, showcasing superior per-
formance in related tasks. GPT-InvestAR (Gupta,
2023) aimed to enhance stock investment strategies
by analyzing annual reports using LLMs. This ap-
proach yielded promising results in outperforming
traditional market returns, highlighting the poten-
tial for LLMs in investment strategies. InvestLM
(Yang et al., 2023b) showed strong capabilities in
understanding economic text and providing prac-
tical investment advice. With retrieval-augmented
LLMs (Zhang et al., 2023b) addressed the chal-
lenges of applying LLMs directly to economic
sentiment analysis, achieving considerable perfor-
mance gains. FinGPT (Wang et al., 2023a) focused
on creating a benchmark for Instruction Tuning of
LLMs in financial datasets, emphasizing the inte-
gration challenges and potential solutions for GPT-
based models specialized in the financial domain.
Sarmah et al. (2023) reduced hallucination in in-
formation extraction from earning call transcripts
and achieved improved the accuracy by combin-

--- PAGE 17 ---
ing retrieval-augmented generation techniques with
metadata. FinLMEval (Guo et al., 2023) assessed
the performance of LLMs in financial natural lan-
guage processing tasks, offering foundational eval-
uations for ongoing efforts to enhance LLMs in
the financial domain. DISC-FinLLM (Chen et al.,
2023) introduced a Chinese financial LLM based
on a Multiple Experts Fine-tuning Framework,
showing improved performance in various mone-
tary scenarios compared to baseline models. Lastly,
the work on data-centric financial LLMs (Chu et al.,
2023) presented a novel approach to better handle
financial tasks with LLMs, emphasizing data pre-
processing and pre-understanding, resulting in sub-
stantial performance improvements on economic
analysis and interpretation tasks. These contribu-
tions collectively illustrate the rapid growth in uti-
lization of LLMs and their tremendous potential in
various financial applications, showcasing their ca-
pacities in revolutionizing financial analysis, fore-
casting, and decision-making processes.
B Pretraining Data Details
Common Crawl Data The Common Crawl
dataset, specifically the C4 snapshot from 2019
to 2021, comprising over 10 billion files, was an
initial broad data source. Text classification via
the ELECTRA Finance domain-specific language
model ensured that the dataset maintained a strong
relevance to financial content. Rigorous domain
filtering and data pruning were employed, isolat-
ing financial-specific texts and discarding irrelevant
content. The final dataset consisted of 800 million
documents, including 300 million English-only and
500 million multilingual files, providing a compre-
hensive base for financial analysis.
News Scraping Our approach extended to news
scraping, particularly focusing on the period from
July 2022 to July 2023. With 300 million data
lines, this dataset allowed for in-depth analysis of
market trends and financial narratives. The dataset
encapsulated a global view of financial markets
by integrating sources like Yahoo, Seeking Alpha,
Eastmoney, and Yicai. This multi-source strategy
ensured a robust, cross-referenced, and credible
dataset. We used scrapers implemented in (Yang
et al., 2023a) to build out News datasets.
SEC Filings An exhaustive scrape of the EDGAR
SEC database from 1993 to 2023 provided detailed
records of accurate business, financial and account-
ing information from official filings. This dataset,exclusively in English, added substantial depth, al-
lowing for analysis of historical market regulatory
impacts and corporate financial maneuvers.
Company Websites and Social Media Further
data were obtained from the top 5000 company
websites and their social media presence on plat-
forms like Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit. This
dataset provided direct corporate communications
and captured broader market sentiments and public
perceptions, notably through an extensive scrape
of the r/WallStreetBets Reddit community.
C Financial data cleaning and
deduplication pipeline
We started of gathering various text corpora shown
in table 1, resulting in a dataset consisting of 2.9B
documents. The data that we collected is not only
unclean but also suffers from large-scale duplica-
tion. As shown by (Soboleva et al., 2023), us-
ing clean and deduplicated data is computation-
ally efficient for model training. The data cleaning
and deduplication pipeline for financial data be-
gins with URL filtering, in which the raw data is
initially processed. This crucial step ensures the
inclusion of only pertinent URLs, enhancing the
datasetâ€™s quality by excluding irrelevant or unsuit-
able sources. Once the URLs are streamlined, the
Text extraction phase commences, whereby con-
tents of documents from the selected URLs are
meticulously extracted, filtering out images while
maintaining the large dataset scale. Following this,
the language identification phase excluded non-
English documents by categorizing them based on
the language of their tokens. Subsequently, the
pipeline further refines the data through Document-
wise domain-based filtering, narrowing down to
100 billion tokens pertinent to the financial domain
by excluding 55B-token non-financial documents.
Recognizing the importance of data privacy and
relevance, the pipeline incorporates removing sen-
sitive information, which is done using a classi-
fier built using FinBERT (Araci, 2019). Line-wise
corrections enhance accuracy and filter out 5B to-
kens of sensitive information. An extensive Fuzzy
deduplication process reduces the data to 38 bil-
lion tokens. This is followed by an Exact dedu-
plication method, which trims another 13 billion
tokens. Finally, the text cleaning process identifies
and excludes 5B improper tokens, including all sen-
sitive information. Ultimately, the pipeline crafts
a streamlined financial dataset, culminating in a

--- PAGE 18 ---
concise 20B-token financial dataset. The pipeline
is illustrated in figure 3.
D Downstream Dataset details
Notable datasets include FPB and FiQA-SA, both
utilized for sentiment analysis, with the former
comprising 48,450 news texts (Malo et al., 2013)
and the latter encompassing 11,730 news head-
lines and tweets (Maia et al., 2018). The FOMC
dataset, consisting of 496 FOMC transcripts, serves
the hawkish-dovish classification task (Shah et al.,
2023a), whereas the Headline dataset, with 11,412
news headlines, aids in news headline classifica-
tion (Sinha and Khandait, 2020). Named entity
recognition is the focus of the NER and Finer-Ord
datasets (Salinas Alvarado et al., 2015; Shah et al.,
2023b). We brought in ECTSUM and EDTSUM
(Mukherjee et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2021) for text
summarisation. For text classification, we included
two credit scoring datasets from the German and
Australia (Hofmann, 1994; Quinlan). We employed
FinQA introduced by the current paper and Con-
vFinQA (Chen et al., 2021, 2022) for numerical
understanding task. We used three existing datasets
for stock movement prediction, namely BigData22,
ACL18, and CIKM18 (Soun et al., 2022; Xu and
Cohen, 2018; Wu et al., 2018).
Firm Disclosure Datasets This study employed
three datasets that serve as a microcosm of firm
regulatory disclosures. Each consists of labelled
text segments from comprehensive reports annually
filed with the Security and Exchange Commission
(SEC) by public companies to inform investors re-
garding their financial health and business risks.
The â€™Firm Social Relationshipsâ€™ (FSR) dataset pro-
vides insight into the intricate network of corpo-
rate interactions, categorized into several key rela-
tional dimensions: ownership, alliances, competi-
tion, and board interlock relationships (Cao et al.,
2020). They identified 3931 sentences stating an-
other firm in a focal firmâ€™s disclosure. Domain
experts classified the relationship between the fo-
cus firm and the firm into one or none of these
relationships. The â€™Cyber Strategiesâ€™ (CS) dataset
contains disclosure sentences describing the firmâ€™s
cybersecurity strategies (Cao et al., 2023). Experts
labelled 240 cybersecurity-related sentences from
firmsâ€™ disclosures into one of five strategies delin-
eated by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology: Identification, Protection, Detection,
Response, and Recovery (NIST, 2018). The â€™IT

Risk Disclosureâ€™ (ITR) dataset is created for this
study using the Risk Factors section of the firmâ€™s an-
nual disclosure. Domain experts categorized 1,196
sentences related to Information Technology into
one or none of the 11 IT risk categories. These
datasets curated by domain experts are pivotal to
our zero-shot evaluation framework, which tests
the modelsâ€™ utility against genuine instructional
dataâ€”thus bridging the gap between theoretical
model performance and practical utility in real-
world scenarios.
Financial Chart Understanding Dataset
The FinVQA dataset addresses tasks involving
questions about trends and details depicted in plots
and graphs embedded in images. This dataset in-
cludes a variety of financial charts, such as line,
bar, and candle charts , all meticulously annotated
by humans and accompanied by multi-turn conver-
sations associated with each image. We developed
two versions of the FinVQA dataset. The first, illus-
trated in Fig. D.1, focuses on simple questions re-
lated to stock market charts and requires the model
to interpret these charts while identifying trends
and performing analysis. These are randomly cho-
sen 100 images that have been human annotated
with different types of questions.
FinVQAv2, presented in Fig. D.2, is a dataset
that captures more advanced and challenging sit-
uations. We gathered 100 images containing fi-

nancial visualizations from various sources and
collected relevant question-and-answer pairs from
the experts to build our dataset. It encompasses
a diverse array of financial graphics and various
relevant questions posed in relation to each image.
For instance, we present a financial dashboard con-
taining various financial metrics in numerical and
graphical formats, and we ask the model to perform
complex calculations using the data extracted from
the image.
Hallucinations Evaluation In the financial context,
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are
prone to hallucinations, giving incorrect answers or
misinterpreting basic facts, as shown by (Kang and
Liu, 2023). We generated two datasets: FinTerms-
MCQ and FinTerms-Gen.
To build FinTerms-MCQ, we generated a dataset
containing 1129 financial terms and their defini-
tions, using the method described by (Ghosh et al.,
2022). This dataset assesses the foundational finan-
cial knowledge of various LLMs and investigates if
retrieval-based methods can reduce the incidence ofhallucinations. We built this dataset in a multiple-
choice format with the question and four options;
all four are closely related, and only one is correct.
FinTerms-Gen is built as a generation task where
we collected terms from Investopedia (2024), and
then we asked our models to answer the definitions.
Examples from this dataset are presented in Table
D.1.

Retrieval: Muskâ€™s December sale of Tesla stock worth $3.6 billion
amid signs of flagging demand for the EV makerâ€™s cars may prompt
an insider trading probe, legal experts said. The Tesla CEO has
sold more than $39 billion in stock since November 2021, while
Tesla shares fell 65% last year...TSLA shares have recovered from
last yearâ€™s sharp downturn and are 15% away from last yearâ€™s highs.
So far in 2023, Teslaâ€™s short sellers have seen roughly $11.6 bil-
lion in mark-to-market losses. Wall Street analysts are divided on
whether TSLA represents a good buy, with some arguing that the
company should see improved margins in 2024 and others claiming
Teslaâ€™s goals are too optimistic...

"prompt" : "How can you correlate a company stock 's performance
with overall market performance?",
"chosen" :
"To correlate a company 's stock performance with overall market
performance, start by selecting a relevant market index like the
S&P 500, Dow Jones, or NASDAQ, which matches the company 's
industry and geographical location. Collect historical data for
the company 's stock prices and the chosen market index over the
same period. Convert this data into returns using the formula
(Current Price - Previous Price) / Previous Price to standardize
it for comparison. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient
between the stock 's and market index returns to measure how
closely they move together. Also, determine the stock 's beta
coefficient to assess its volatility relative to the market. For
visual insight, plot a scatter plot of the stock 's returns
against the market index. Conduct a linear regression analysis
with the market index as the independent variable and the stock
as the dependent variable to further explore the market 's
influence on the stock. Lastly, consider external factors like
economic conditions and industry-specific news, as they can
significantly impact stock performance.",
"rejected" :
"There are several ways to correlate a company 's stock
performance with overall market performance:\n\n1. Market
capitalization: The market capitalization, or market cap, of a
company is calculated by multiplying the total number of shares
outstanding by the current stock price. The market cap of a
company can be compared to the overall market cap of the stock
market to determine the company 's market exposure.\n2. Industry
average stock performance: Comparing a company 's stock
performance to the average stock performance of its industry can
provide insight into how the company performs relative to its
peers. Sector performance: Comparing a company 's stock
performance to the performance of stocks in the same sector can
provide insight into how the company performs relative to other
companies in the same industry. Economic indicators: Economic
indicators such as GDP, inflation, and interest rates can impact
the stock market 's and individual companies 'overall performance.
By analyzing the correlation between a company 's stock
performance and these economic indicators, investors can gain
insight into how broader economic trends may impact the company 's
performance.",

Wikipedia : A No-Doc or Low-doc loan (abbr: No/Low Documentation Loan) refers to loans
that do not require borrowers to provide income documentation to lenders or require little
documentation.
FinTral-RL-T&R : A low/no documentation loan allows a potential borrower to apply for a
mortgage while providing little or no information regarding their employment, income, or assets.
Regulation of these loans has evolved significantly since 2008, but they remain an option for some
borrowers in nontraditional financial situations.
Annotator Rating: A
ChatGPT : A low/no documentation loan is a type of mortgage or loan where the borrower is
not required to provide extensive financial documentation, such as income and asset verification,
making it easier to qualify but often resulting in higher interest rates.
Annotator Rating: A
GPT-4 : A Low/No Documentation Loan is a type of loan that requires minimal or no verification

Prompt : What is the definition of â€™Open Marketâ€™ in the financial domain?
Wikipedia : An open market is an economic system without trade barriers to free market activities.
In an open market, buyers and sellers can do business freely without common barriers, such
as unfair licensing agreements, arbitrary taxes, unionization, subsidies, and other regulations
affecting regular market operations.
FinTral-RL-T&R : An open market is an economic system with little to no barriers to free-market
activity. An open market is characterized by the absence of tariffs, taxes, licensing requirements,
subsidies, unionization, and any other regulations or practices that interfere with free-market
activity. Open markets may have competitive barriers to entry, but never any regulatory barriers to
entry.
Annotator Rating: A
ChatGPT : In finance, the Open Market refers to a marketplace where securities are traded directly
between buyers and sellers without the intervention of a third party, such as an exchange.
Annotator Rating: C
GPT-4 : An "Open Market" in the financial domain refers to an economic system with few barriers
to free market activity. It typically involves unrestricted buying and selling of goods and services,
with prices determined by supply and demand, and minimal government intervention in terms of
tariffs, quotas, or regulations. This concept is fundamental in the operation of capital markets,
where securities are freely traded.

Calculate the EBIT A Margin here
However , in the provided Profit and Loss Statement, only
EBIT  (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) is given.
Amortization is not listed, so we'll assume EBIT A is equal
to EBIT  in this case.
From the image, the EBIT  (Earnings Before Interest &
Taxes) is given as 162, and the Total Net Revenue is
2520.
Hence the EBIT  = multiply(divide(162,2520),100)Applications of FinT ral
