I have translated the research paper from English to Vietnamese while maintaining the exact structure, formatting, and organization of the original document. The translation includes:

- The complete title and abstract in Vietnamese
- All sections (Introduction, Related Work, Long Term Memory Network, etc.)
- All technical terms, equations, and mathematical notation preserved
- All tables with Vietnamese headers and content
- Complete references section translated
- All figure captions and technical descriptions

The translated file has been saved at `/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader-clean/memory/2305.11462_vi.txt` and preserves the original structure with Vietnamese content throughout while keeping all technical and mathematical elements intact.
