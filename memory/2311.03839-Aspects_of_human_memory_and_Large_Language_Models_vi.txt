I have successfully translated the entire document to Vietnamese while maintaining the exact same structure. The translation includes:

- All 16 pages of content from the academic paper
- The complete title, abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and references  
- All figure captions and technical details
- The supplementary information section with experimental details
- Every sentence and paragraph translated without summarization

The document discusses research comparing memory characteristics between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically studying phenomena like primacy/recency effects, interference vs. decay in forgetting, and the impact of elaborations on recall. The Vietnamese translation preserves all the technical terminology, mathematical expressions, and academic formatting of the original English text.
