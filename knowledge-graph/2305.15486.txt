Abstract
Open-world survival games pose significant challenges for AI algorithms due to
their multi-tasking, deep exploration, and goal prioritization requirements. Despite
reinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample
complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Crafter or
Minecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read Crafter’s original aca-
demic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game through
a large language model (LLM). Prompted with the L ATEX source as game context
and a description of the agent’s current observation, our SPRING framework em-
ploys a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with game-related questions as nodes and
dependencies as edges. We identify the optimal action to take in the environment
by traversing the DAG and calculating LLM responses for each node in topological
order, with the LLM’s answer to final node directly translating to environment
actions. In our experiments, we study the quality of in-context “reasoning” induced
by different forms of prompts under the setting of the Crafter environment. Our
experiments suggest that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought,
have great potential in completing sophisticated high-level trajectories. Quantita-
tively, SPRING with GPT-4 outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained
for 1M steps, without any training. Finally, we show the potential of Crafter as a
test bed for LLMs. Code at github.com/holmeswww/SPRING
1 Introduction
Open-world survival games like Minecraft (Fan et al., 2022) and Crafter (Hafner, 2021) pose
significant challenges for AI algorithms due to a combination of factors: procedural generation
requires strong generalization; diverse action space requires multi-task capabilities; technology tree
requires long-term planning and deep exploration; diverse and conflicting objectives requires goal
prioritization. In particular, Crafter is designed for efficient simulation and fast iteration. Similar to
Minecraft, Crafter features key challenges such as multi-tasking, exploration with a deep and wide
tech-tree, requiring the agent to craft multiple tools and interact with multiple objects to survive in
the game.
Reinforcement learning (RL) has been the go-to approach for game-based problems, with numerous
successes in games like Go (Silver et al., 2017), robotics (Fu et al., 2020; Hafner et al., 2023) and
various video games (Vinyals et al., 2019; Schrittwieser et al., 2020; Badia et al., 2020; Hafner
et al., 2023). While RL demonstrated impressive performance, it still suffers from certain limitations,
such as high sample complexity and difficulty in incorporating prior knowledge. Such drawbacks
make it exceptionally challenging to apply RL to diverse and complex open-world benchmarks like

Figure 1: Overview of SPRING. The context string, shown in the middle column, is obtained by
parsing the L ATEX source code of Hafner (2021). The LLM-based agent then takes input from a
visual game descriptor and the context string. The agent uses questions composed into a DAG for
chain-of-thought reasoning, and the last node of the DAG is parsed into action.
Crafter (Hafner, 2021) or Minecraft (Fan et al., 2022). Addressing the benefits and drawbacks of RL
is therefore crucial for achieving a sample-efficient solution.
On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2022; Chowdhery
et al., 2022) have shown remarkable success when prompted for various tasks, including embodied
planning and acting (Ahn et al., 2022; Du et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023), QA or
dialogue (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023), and general problem-solving (Brown et al., 2020;
Bubeck et al., 2023). Their unique planning (Ahn et al., 2022), reasoning (Shinn et al., 2023), and
problem-solving (Bubeck et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023) ability makes them a promising candidate
for incorporating prior knowledge and in-context reasoning for game-based problems, particularly
when it comes to addressing the aforementioned limitations of RL.
Hence, in this work, we study the possibility and reliability of LLMs for understanding and reasoning
with human knowledge, in the setting of games. We consider a two staged approach SPRING
(Figure 1): (1) studying the paper : the first stage reads the L ATEX of the paper of (Hafner, 2021) and
(2)reasoning : the second stage involves reasoning about that knowledge through a QA framework to
take an environment action. Note that the Crafter environment was released after the data collection
date of GPT-3.5 and GPT 4 (OpenAI, 2023) models2, the environment is unseen to them. We first
use LLM to extract prior knowledge from the L ATEX source code of the original paper by Hafner
(2021). We then use a similar QA summarization framework as Wu et al. (2023) which produces QA
dialogue on game mechanics. SPRING handles significantly more diverse contextual information
than (Wu et al., 2023), making use of all 17 action/interaction types and even information about
desirable behaviors documented in the paper.
We focus on reading the relevant academic paper in the first stage of SPRING, by first deciding
the paragraphs that are relevant for playing the game. Then we extract key information through
a series of questions such as “ Write all information helpful for the game in a numbered list. ". In
the second stage,we promote and regulate in-context chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs to solve
complex games. The reasoning module is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), with questions as nodes
and dependencies as edges. For example, the question “ For each action, are the requirements met? "
depends on the question “ What are the top 5 actions? ", creating an edge from the latter to the former.
For each environment step, we traverse the DAG computing LLM answers for each node in the
topological order of the graph. The final node of the DAG is a question about the best action to take
and the LLM answer for the question is directly translated to environment action.
Qualitatively, our experiments show that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, can
execute sophisticated trajectories independently in Crafter (Hafner, 2021). Quantitatively, SPRING’s
zero-shot performance with GPT-4 surpassing all state-of-the-art RL algorithmstrained for 1M steps
(Table 2).
Our contributions are as follows:

•SPRING is the first to tackle a competitive RL benchmark by explicitly extracting multiple
interactions and tech-tree dependencies directly from an academic paper.
•We are the first to show SOTA performance in a challenging open world game with a
zero-shot LLM-based (GPT-4) policy
•We study the quality of in-context “reasoning” induced by different prompts and propose a
controlled chain-of-thought prompting through a DAG of questions for decision making.
2 Method
This section is structured as follows. We first describe how we generate the context from the L ATEX
source code of Hafner (2021) in Section 2.1. Then we describe our SPRING framework and how we
compute the action in Section 2.2.
Problem Setting Our goal is to show that LLMs can plan and act reasonably well in an environment
where control tasks are less required. In the setting of Crafter, we define the states, s, as samples
from state distribution S. We are interested in creating a goal-conditioned policy πwhich maps state
sto action a∈A,π:S→A. Due to the use of LLM, we further break the policy down into two
parts: a descriptor Dwhich describes key aspects the visual observation in plain text ( d=D(s)).
And an LLM-based actor which takes state description dand outputs action a.
In addition, we define Sj
parato be the jthparagraph in the L ATEX source of the environment paper
(Hafner, 2021), and MLLM to be the LLM which takes a context string and a question string as input
and outputs an answer to the question.
2.1 Studying the paper: Context from L ATEX source
Figure 2: Paper Studying Moudle. The 3-step approach for computing Cqfrom the L ATEXsource
code of Hafner (2021). First, as shown in the left column, for each paragraph we compute LLM
answer for all relevancy questions in Qrel, and keep only the relevant paragraphs. Second, as shown in
the middle column, we compute paragraph-level LLM answer to q. Third, we summarize the answer
intoCqwith a summary prompt; we concatenate Cqacross q∈Qgame and obtain C.
Similar to Wu et al. (2023), we compose gameplay specific questions and then compute LLM answer
to the questions for each subsection in the latex files. Since a considerable amount of the paper is
irrelevant to the gameplay, we use a set of 2 questions Qrel={“Would this paragarph help me succeed in this game?",
“Does this paragraph contain information on the game mechanics, or game strategies?"} to identify relevance, and a set of 4
questions Qgame={“Write all information helpful for the game in a numbered list.", “In plain text. List all objects I need to interact/avoid to
survive in the game. Use "I would like to X object Y" in each step. Replace Y by the actual object, X by the actual interaction.", “Write all game
objectives numbered list. For each objective, list its requirements.", “Write all actions as a numbered list. For each action, list its requirements."}
to summarize gameplay and action space relevant information. We add the prompt “DO NOT answer in
LaTeX.” to all of Qgameto prevent the LLM from outputting the list in L ATEX format.
For a specific gameplay specific question q∈Qgame, our goal is to compute Cq, the answer to q
conditioned on the paper. However, since the length of the paper exceeds input length constraints
for most LLMs, we have to break the paper down into paragraphs individual Sj
para. We provide an
illustration of the process in Figure 2.
First, we filter the paragraphs for relevance and keep only paragraphs identified as relevant by at least
one question from Qrel. We set Prel
qto be the set of relevant paragraphs.

Second, we compute the set, Aq, of answers to qfor each relevant paragraph from Prel
q, from the
LATEX source code.
Aq=
MLLM (Spara, q) :Spara∈Prel

(2)
Third, to obtain the answer string Cqfrom the set Aq, we query an LLM with a summarization
prompt qsummarize =“Remove duplicate items.”
Cq=MLLM (concat (Aq), qsummarize ) (3)
Finally, we concatenate (with the linebreak character) all question-context pairs to form the context
string Cfor SPRING.
C=concat ({“Question: qAnswer: Cq”|∀q∈Qgame}) (4)
2.2 Reasoning: QA-DAG for SPRING
Node Question
q1List objects in the current observation. For each object, briefly answer what resource it provides
and its requirement.
q2 What was the last action taken by the player?
q3 For each object in the list, are the requirements met for the interaction?
q4 Did the last player action succeed? If not, why?
q5 List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
q6 What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
q7List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from
the list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
q8 For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
qa Choose the best executable action from above.
Table 1: List of all 9 questions in Qact. The questions are designed to promote consistent chain-of-
thought. Experimentally, we find the LLM robust to different phrasing of the questions.
Figure 3: Reasoning. (a) The visual descriptor takes the last two gameplay screens as input, and
outputs their descriptions in language ( dt, dt−1).(b)SPRING traverses a DAG of questions from
Table 1 in topological order. Answer to the final question qais mapped to environment action using
sub-string matching. (c)The LLM answer for each question (node) is conditioned on the previous 2
steps of observation, the context C, and answers to the immediate parents of the current node.
For LLMs to be able to understand the gameplay, we first follow Du et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023)
to define an visual descriptor Mdescwhich converts state s∈Sto textual description d(Figure 3 a).
4

--- PAGE 5 ---
To achieve consistent chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2021) throughout hundreds of steps
within one round of gameplay, we compose a fixed set of questions Qact={q1, . . . , q a}to query
the LLM at every step of the game, with question-question dependencies as D={(qu, qv)|qu, qv∈
Qactand answering qvrequires the answer of qu}. Note that the above specification forms a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) with nodes Qactedges D(Figure 3 b).
For any question (node) qv∈Qact, we compute the answer At
qvfor time step t, conditioned on the
gameplay context C, most recent 2 steps of game description dt−1, dt, and answers to its dependencies
(Figure 3 c).

(5)
Experimentally, we find that prompting the LLM with only the direct parents of a question greatly
reduces the context length, and helps LLM to focus on the most relevant contextual information.
We traverse the DAG using a modified topological sort algorithm to compute LLM answer for each
question based on its topological order. Finally, we map the answer to the last question in the node qa
directly to one of the 17 named actions in the environment with sub-string matching ( a=At
a). We
take the default action “Do” on sub-string matching failure.3
3 Experiments and Results
We present our experiments as follows. First, we explain our experimental setup and baselines for our
experiments. Then, we compare SPRING to popular RL methods on the Crafter benchmark. Finally,
we conduct experiments and analysis on different pieces of our architecture to study the influence of
each part over the in-context “reasoning” capabilities of the LLM.
3.1 Experimental Details
The Crafter environment (Hafner, 2021) is a procedurally generated open-world survival game for
benchmarking RL algorithms with 22 achievements in a tech tree of depth 7. The environment is a
grid-world features top-down observation and discrete action space of size 17. The observation also
shows the current inventory state of the player, including its health points, food, water, rest levels,
and inventory. The game is inspired by Minecraft and features a similar get-to-diamond challenge.
In comparison, Crafter captures many key research challenges of Minecraft in a simpler and faster
environment, thus speeding up experiments and result collection.
Environment Descriptor The gameplay screen (top left of Fig 3.) consists of a 9 ×9 grid
({(i, j)|1≤i, j≤9}). The top 7 rows consist of the local view of the world; each cell (i, j)is
associated with a pre-defined background (e.g., “grass”, “water”, “none”) and possibly with an object
“asset” (e.g., “tree”, “health”, “player”). The bottom 2 rows represent agent status (e.g., “health”) and
item inventories, which include images of assets (e.g., “stone sword”), and the number of each assent
in the inventory.
Our environment descriptor accepts as input the gameplay screen and outputs a text description of
the screen. We first create combinations of background and object (appearance) assets. Then we
add number assets to recognize the quantity of inventory/ status. We match these combinations
with the gameplay screen, using cv2.filters with a matching threshold of0.9. We disable the
detector during nights when observations are unreliable. Finally, for each (i, j), we filter the matched
combinations, and select the one with the highest matching score. From this information, we can
measure the distance and direction of each object relative to the player; simultaneously, we can count
the agent status and inventory item.
The environment descriptor then obtains the set of objects in observation O =
{(obj, dist, direction )}, the set of inventory items I={(object, count )}, and the agent status
H={(attribute, value, max )}. Including only the closest object of each kind, we compose the
observation description das: “You see : - <obj> <dist> steps to your <direction>. Your status:
<attribute>: <value>/ <max>. Your inventory: - <object>: <count>”. We describe direction of objects
using “north”,“south”,“east”,“west”.

Table 2: Table comparing SPRING and popular RL algorithms in terms of game score, reward, and
training steps. Results for SPRING is summarized over 5 independent trials. SPRING out-performs
the previous SOTA in terms of all metrics. In addition, since SPRING gathers knowledge from
reading the paper, it requires no training.
Evaluation Metrics Agents in Crafter are evaluated primarily based on two metrics: reward and
score. The game assigns a sparse +1reward each time the agent unlocks a new achievement in an
episode, and assigns reward of −0.1/0.1when the agent loses/gains one health point. The score
metric (Hafner, 2021) is computed by aggregating the success rates for each achievement:
S= exp 
1
NNX
i=1ln (1 + si)!
−1,
where siis the agent’s success rate on achievement iandN= 22 is the number of achievements.
Note that RL agents only train on the reward, and SPRING does not require any training.
RL Baselines We include results from popular actor-critic methods like PPO (Schulman et al.,
2017); DQN variants like Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018); intrinsically motivated methods like
RND (Burda et al., 2018), Plan2Explore (Sekar et al., 2020), EDE (Jiang et al., 2022); LLM assisted
solutions like ELLM Du et al. (2023); model-based methods like DreamerV2 (Hafner et al., 2020);
DreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023), which currently holds the state-of-the-art.
LLMs. For LLM access, we use GPT-3.5-turbo (OpenAI, OpenAI) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)
from OpenAI’s API.
3.2 Overall Results
We compare the performance of RL baselines to SPRING with GPT-4 conditioned on the environment
paper (Hafner, 2021) in Table 2.
SPRING out-performs the previous SOTA, including previous attempts at using LLMs for Crafter
by large margins, achieving an 88% relative improvement on game score and a 5%improvement in
reward on the best performing RL method (Hafner et al., 2023). Since the model obtains knowledge
from reading the paper, SPRING requires 0training steps, while RL methods generally require
millions of training steps4.
We include a plot of unlock rate by task, comparing our method to popular RL baselines in Figure 4.
SPRING assisted by prior knowledge out-performs RL methods by more than 10x on achievements
like “Make Stone Pickaxe”, “Make Stone Sword”, and “Collect Iron”, which are up to depth 5 down
in the tech tree and significantly harder to reach through random exploration. For achievements
“Eat Cow” and “Collect Drink”, SPRING achieves perfect performance, whereas model-based RL
framework like Dreamer-V3 has more than 5x lower unlock rate for “eat cow” since cows are moving
and harder to reach through random exploration. Finally, we note that SPRING did not take the action
“Place Stone”, which can be reached easily by random exploration, since placing a stone was not
discussed as beneficial for the agent in the paper (Hafner, 2021).
4We base our comparison on the hard 1M cap set by Hafner (2021).

Table 3: Analysis on how different parts of SPRING contribute to its performance, comparing the
max achievement depth in the tech tree, the reward, and the number of human-written questions in
the prompt. Results are summarized over 5 independent trials. The first 4 rows study the necessity
of prior knowledge from the context string C. The middle 4 rows study different chain-of-thought
prompting techniques. The last 2 rows study the role of LLMs. All three aspects are important for
SPRING to achieve best reported performance.
3.3 Component Analysis
We study how the different aspects of the framework contribute to the behavior of the agent through a
series of ablations as shown in Table 3.
Studying the L ATEX Paper In the first 4 rows of Table 3, we investigate the contribution of
gameplay context from the L ATEX paper toward performance of the agent. We report the performance
of SPRING with no contextual information (w/o C) (row 4); SPRING conditioned on only the action
descriptions and dependencies from (Hafner, 2021) Table F.1 (only question 4 from Qgame) (row 3);
SPRING conditioned on the context manually modified to exclude the “crafting table” dependency
for wooden_pickaxe by removing two corresponding lines from the context C(row 2); SPRING
conditioned on the full context from the paper (row 1).
As expected, since Crafter environment is unseen for GPT, the agent achieves performance similar
to random agent without any game context. When provided with only action descriptions and
action dependencies, using only question 4 from Qgamein section 2.1, SPRING achieves strong 67%
performance comparable to DreamerV2 (Silver et al., 2017).
For the next piece of the experiment, we manually remove “near crafting table” dependency for
wooden_pickaxe from it’s context, which is required for 11 later achievements. SPRING with GPT-4
incurs a 24% performance drop. Interestingly, we find that the LLM has some ability to recover from
7

--- PAGE 8 ---
the inaccurate context information. We observe that after failing to craft the wooden_pickaxe without
a table, the agent instead tries to craft a wooden_sword first to maintain survival. Eventually, the agent
was able to identify the missing requirement through guessing and trying after some unsuccessful
trials, and craft the wooden_pickaxe. However, the confusion delayed the agent’s progress and
therefore causes the performance gap with the agent conditioned on the full context (row 5).
Reasoning In the middle 4 rows of Table 3, we investigate the contribution of different prompting
methods toward performance of the model. Conditioned on the full context from the L ATEX paper, we
report the performance of GPT-4 directly prompted to output the action using the last question qaonly
(row 8); GPT-4 prompted with all questions from Qactbut in a list without the DAG dependencies D
(row 7); GPT-4 prompted “Let’s think step-by-step” (Kojima et al., 2022) about the next action, and
prompted to choose a permissible action qawith let’s think step-by-step followed by qaagain (row
6); GPT-4 with SPRING (row 5).
Relative to our method, we observe that directly prompting the LLM for the action leads to a 80%
performance drop, and therefore does not result in a meaningful agent. The popular chain-of-thought
reasoning prompt “Let’s think step-by-step” (Kojima et al., 2022) achieves reasonable reward with
a40% drop, but with a high 60.27% standard deviation. Qualitatively, we observe that the LLM
produces inconsistent outputs across time steps, due to the fact that the model’s chain-of-thought
is not directed or controlled through the prompt. Therefore, LLMs prompted with “Let’s think
step-by-step” alone cannot reliably follow a good policy. Controlling the chain-of-thought with 9
questions from Qact(section 2.2) successfully controls the consistency of LLM outputs across time
qualitatively. However, we observe that the LLM often ignores earlier questions at later stages of QA
when all previous questions are presented in a list, leading to random disagreements in answers. For
example, the LLM may correctly identify that it needs “wooden pickaxe” to mine the stone ahead
in the first few questions, but forgets about the requirement later when it’s prompted for actions.
Quantitatively, the model performs 65% worse with 90% variance without the DAG. The introduction
of DAG eliminates this problem by reducing the QA context length to only a question’s immediate
parents.
Overall, SPRING achieves the best performance and a small 6%performance standard deviation, due
to more consistent reasoning over time steps with better focus and fewer distractions.
LLM In the last two rows of Table 3, we show that the same architecture does not work well with
GPT-3.5-turbo. We believe the observed 73% performance gap mainly comes from GPT-3.5-turbo’s
worse performance at following fine-grained instructions in each of the questions, which are required
for chain-of-thought reasoning with SPRING.
3.4 Cost for running SPRING
The number of queries per step is 9 (same as the number of questions). Each game could take around
300 steps, but can go up to 500 steps in the worst case. Therefore, the maximum number of queries
per game can go up to 4500. According to the public price of GPT-4 API, each query costs around
0.065. The total cost should be less than 270 (USD) per game with GPT-4. Given the progress
in chip-set development, we are hopeful that the inference costs will lower, making LLMs more
accessible for the public.
3.5 Potential for Benchmarking LLMs
In Table 4, we compare popular publicly available LLMs including GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), GPT-3.5
(text-davinci-003) (OpenAI, OpenAI), Bard (Manyika, Manyika), Claude (Anthropic, Anthropic),
Alpaca-30b (Taori et al., 2023) under the same setting on Crafter, following the same step-by-step
prompt as Section 3.3 and Table 3. We observe a clear separation in performance under our setting.

improve given enough trials. However, RL algorithms are typically trained with reward functions
deliberately engineered to cover all in-game achievements (Hafner, 2021; Hafner et al., 2023). Such
reward functions often require a lot of expert knowledge and careful formulation.
On the other hand, LLM agents like SPRING does not need the reward (we report reward for
comparison purpose, SPRING does not use the reward during inference), but instead uses external
knowledge from the L ATEX source code. In addition, current LLM agents lack the capabilities of
improving from interactions.
We hope future works would be able to leverage the benefits of both paradigms in order to achieve
efficient planning with fine-grained control.

step instructions have been used to generate auxiliary rewards, when environment rewards are sparse.
Goyal et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2019) use auxiliary reward-learning modules trained offline to
predict whether trajectory segments correspond to natural language annotations of expert trajectories.
There has been many attempts to go beyond instruction following to learning from unstructured
natural language (Branavan et al., 2012; Goldwasser and Roth, 2014; Zhong et al., 2021; Wang
and Narasimhan, 2021). Zhong et al. (2021); Wang and Narasimhan (2021) make use of special
architectures to learn reasoning on grid worlds with template-generated instructions. However, the
model requires 200 million training samples from templates identical to the test environments. Such
a training requirement limiting the generalization of the model and causes performance loss even on
slightly bigger grid worlds with identical mechanics.
Wu et al. (2023) proposes a summary (Read) and reasoning (Reward) through a QA prompting
framework with an open-source QA LLM (Tafjord and Clark, 2021). The framework demonstrates
the possibility of an using real-world human-written manuals to improve RL performance on popular
games, despite limiting the interaction types to only “hit”. Our framework handles all 17 kinds of
interactions available in the game. Moreover, our framework makes use of information on tech-tree
dependencies, and suggestions on desired policies extracted from the academic paper.
LLMs for Planning LLMs have shown promising results at high-level planning in indoor embodied
manipulation environments. Huang et al. (2022); Ahn et al. (2022) primarily explores generating
plans for embodied tasks, with limited actions space and trajectory length. Song et al. (2022); Wu
et al. (2022) enhances Ahn et al. (2022) with greater action diversity and real-time re-planning.
However, a lot of the high-level plans lack executability and has to be post-processed to meet specific
task requirements, thus limiting the generalization to complex open world tasks. In addition, all
prior works along this line operates on few-shot human/expert generated demonstrations containing
up to 17 trajectories to provide context for LLMs, which requires more manual labor, and may
limit the generalization to unseen scenarios. In comparison, our SPRING framework requires no
demonstration.
LLMs for Open World Games Compared to popular indoor manipulation tasks, planning in open-
world game environments poses the following additional challenges. 1) Long horizon. Due to the
nature how in-game achievement/technology progresses, a successful gameplay can easily go beyond
200 steps (Hafner, 2021). 2) Parallel objectives. Open-world environments contain objectives that
can be pursued in parallel and often require prioritization (Wang et al., 2023). Therefore, open world
games are significantly more challenging than current indoor embodied manipulation environments.

Du et al. (2023) applies LLMs as high-level planners to assist RL exploration in Crafter. Wang
et al. (2023); Yuan et al. (2023) use LLMs as high-level planner and goal selector to control a low
level-policy in Minecraft. Tsai et al. (2023) studies the capabilities of ChatGPT on text games.
Notably, all prior works require expert or human generated example trajectories as context for the
LLMs. Since the example trajectories do not cover all scenarios, all prior works may encounter
unseen situation during evaluation, leading to an overall performance inferior to state-of-the-art
RL algorithms (Hessel et al., 2018; Guss et al., 2021; Hafner et al., 2023), trained without the use
of LLMs. To our knowledge, we are the first to show an LLM (GPT-4) achieving performance
surpassing the state-of-the-art RL algorithms in a challenging open world game.
5 Limitations and Future Work
A primary limitation in using an LLM to support interaction with the environment is the need for
object recognition and grounding. However, these limitations do not exist in environments that offer
accurate object information, such as contemporary games (Fan et al., 2022) and virtual reality worlds
(Kolve et al., 2017). While pre-trained visual backbones (He et al., 2017) perform poorly on games,
they have shown reasonable performance for environments closer to the real-world (Shridhar et al.,
2020). In addition, with recent progress on visual-language models (Bubeck et al., 2023; Driess et al.,
2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023), we believe there will be reliable and generalizable solutions
to visual-language understanding in the foreseeable future. Future works could focus on address the
requirement for a separate visual descriptor with large visual-language models.
6 Conclusions
In this work, we explore solving the Crafter (Hafner, 2021) RL benchmark using the latest LLMs by
reading the L ATEX source code of an academic paper about the benchmark. We study the quality of
in-context “reasoning” and “planning” induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of
the Crafter open-world environment. To enforce consistent planning and execution over hundreds of
environment steps, we introduce SPRING, an innovative prompting framework for LLMs designed
to enable in-context chain-of-thought planning and reasoning. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4
outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training.
Our work demonstrates the reliability of LLMs for understanding and reasoning with human knowl-
edge. We hope that our work points to a new way of integrating human prior knowledge into RL
training through intrinsic rewards (Wu et al., 2023), hierarchical RL (Shu et al., 2017), or sub-goal
planning (Wang et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023).
Broader Impacts
Our research on LLM holds potential for both positive and negative impacts. The benefits include
better understanding of the powers of LLM and enhanced integration of prior knowledge, which could
lead to advancement in various AI topics. However, the risks may involve reliance on computationally
demanding models, game cheating or exploitation, and reliance on prior knowledge.

------------ QA ------------
Question: Action
Answer:
Move North
Question: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its
requirement.
Answer:
1. Tree: Provides wood which is used to craft tools and structures like the table. Requirement: An axe or hands to chop down
the tree.
2. Cow: Provides food when killed, restoring your health points. Requirement: A weapon like a sword to kill the cow or hands
to punch it.
3. Grass: Generally provides no resources, but it can occasionally drop seeds for planting. No requirements to interact with
grass.
Question: What was the last action taken by the player?
Answer:
The last action taken by the player was "make_wood_sword."
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
1. Tree: Yes, the requirements are met as you can use your hands to chop down the tree, even though it will be slower than
using an axe.
2. Cow: Yes, the requirements are met as you have crafted a wood sword to kill the cow, which is more efficient than using
your hands.
3. Grass: Yes, there are no specific requirements to interact with grass, and you can simply walk on it or punch it with
your hands if necessary.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Chop down the tree to collect wood (Priority: 5/5) - Wood is essential for crafting more tools and structures, as well as
potentially making a shelter.
2. Kill the cow for food (Priority: 4/5) - Ensuring a sufficient food supply is crucial for maintaining health and being
able to accomplish other tasks.
3. Explore the environment (Priority: 3/5) - It is essential to gain more information about available resources and
potential dangers in the surrounding area so that you can plan effectively.
Priority level is indicated out of 5, where 5 is the highest priority and 1 is the lowest priority.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (Chop down the tree to collect wood):
1. Approach the tree: Navigate to the tree located 5 steps to your north-east.
What the player should do first:
1. Move North-East: Move in the direction of the tree to eventually reach it and then prepare to chop it down.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
Priority 1: Move North - Requirement: Flat ground above the agent.
Priority 2: Move East - Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent.
Priority 3: Move East - Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent.
Priority 4: Do (Chop down the tree) - Requirement: Facing the tree; have necessary tool (wooden sword can be used, but a
wooden pickaxe would be preferred).
Priority 5: Collect Wood - Requirement: Successfully chopped the tree, and wood is available to pick up.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
Priority 1: Move North - Yes, the requirement is met as flat ground is above the agent.
Priority 2: Move East - Yes, the requirement is met as flat ground is available to the right of the agent.
Priority 3: Move East - Yes, the requirement is met as flat ground is available to the right of the agent.
Priority 4: Do (Chop down the tree) - The requirement is partially met; you are facing the tree and have a wooden sword, but
a wooden pickaxe is preferred for chopping down trees.
Priority 5: Collect Wood - No, the requirement is not met yet, as you have not successfully chopped down the tree or
accessed the wood.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
14

--- PAGE 15 ---
I cannot determine if the last player action succeeded or not because there is no information provided about the result of
the action "make_wood_sword." Normally, if the action was successful, the player would have a wood sword in their
inventory or an updated game state would include the new item.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the above list is Priority 1: Move North, as the requirement of having flat ground above the
agent is met.
============Step: 1, Cumulative Reward: 0.0============
You took action move_north.
You see:
- tree 4 steps to your east
- cow 6 steps to your north-west
You face grass at your front (north).
Your status:
- health: 9/9
- food: 9/9
- drink: 9/9
- energy: 9/9
You have nothing in your inventory.
------------ QA ------------
Question: Action
Answer:
Move East
Question: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its
requirement.
Answer:
1. Tree: Provides wood, requires a wood or better pickaxe to collect.
2. Cow: Provides meat (food), requires a sword or other weapon to defeat and collect the resource.
3. Grass: No direct resources, can be used to build a shelter or pathway with no specific tool requirements.
Question: What was the last action taken by the player?
Answer:
The last action taken by the player was move_north.
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
1. Tree: Yes, your recent action was making a wood sword so you can interact with the tree to collect wood.
2. Cow: Yes, you have a wood sword to defeat the cow, so you can interact with it.
3. Grass: Yes, there are no specific tool requirements to interact with the grass.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Collect wood from the tree. Priority: 5/5
2. Defeat the cow and collect meat (food). Priority: 4/5
3. Interact with grass to clear a path or build a shelter. Priority: 3/5
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The requirements for the top sub-task (collect wood from the tree) are to have a wood pickaxe in the inventory and be close
enough to the tree.
The player should first move closer to the tree located 4 steps to the east. Once the player is nearby, they should use
their wood pickaxe to collect wood from the tree.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground to the right of the agent) - to get closer to the tree.
2. Priority 2: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - to be in front of the tree.
3. Priority 3: Make Wood Pickaxe (Requirement: Nearby table; wood in inventory) - to be able to collect wood from the tree.
4. Priority 4: Do (Requirement: Facing tree or material; have a wood pickaxe) - to collect wood from the tree.
5. Priority 5: Make Wood Sword (Requirement: Nearby table; wood in inventory) - to defend yourself against potential threats
(such as monsters).
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move East (Flat ground to the right of the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met as the agent is on flat
ground.
2. Priority 2: Move North (Flat ground above the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met as the agent is on flat ground.
3. Priority 3: Make Wood Pickaxe (Nearby table; wood in inventory) - No, the requirement is not met as the agent does not
have a nearby table and wood in their inventory.
4. Priority 4: Do (Facing tree or material; have a wood pickaxe) - No, the requirement is not met as the agent does not have
a wood pickaxe in their inventory.
5. Priority 5: Make Wood Sword (Nearby table; wood in inventory) - No, the requirement is not met as the agent does not have
a nearby table and wood in their inventory.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_north) succeeded because there was flat ground available to the north of the player’s
position, allowing them to move in that direction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
15

--- PAGE 16 ---
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move East, as the requirement of flat ground to the right of
the agent is met.

3. Grass: Can be used to make plantations or used for aesthetic purposes; requires being dug to collect.
Question: What was the last action taken by the player?
Answer:
The last action taken by the player was move_east.
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
Based on the current observation and inventory:
1. Tree: The requirement is not met because you need a wood pickaxe or better to chop down the tree, and you have nothing in
your inventory.
2. Cow: The requirement is not met because you need a wood sword or better to kill the cow, and you have nothing in your
inventory.
3. Grass: The requirement is met as you can dig the grass without any special tool.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Collect Wood (Priority: 5/5) - Collecting wood is essential to craft tools and build structures. First, you need to craft
a wood pickaxe to chop down trees and obtain wood. However, you currently don’t have the required tools to interact
with the tree.
2. Craft a Wood Pickaxe and Wood Sword (Priority: 4/5) - Once you collect wood, you should craft a wood pickaxe to enable
collecting stone and a wood sword to defend yourself and hunt for food. You need a table to craft these items, so you
might need to find or place one.
3. Collect Food and Water (Priority: 3/5) - Maintaining your food and drink levels is crucial for survival. You have
observed a cow nearby, but you currently don’t have the required tools to kill it. You should prioritize crafting
tools, and then hunt the cow for food. For water, you need to find a water source like a lake or river to drink from.
Note: The priority scale is from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest priority and 5 being the highest priority.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Top Sub-task: Collect Wood
Requirements:
1. Facing the tree
2. Having the necessary tool (wood pickaxe) to chop down the tree and collect wood
What should the player do first:
Before collecting wood, the player needs to craft a wood pickaxe. To craft a wood pickaxe, the player requires a table and
wood in their inventory. Since the player currently doesn’t have any tools or a table, they should first find or place
a table, then collect wood using their hands or any available tool, and use the table to craft a wood pickaxe. After
crafting the wood pickaxe, the player can chop down the tree and collect wood more efficiently, which can be used for
crafting other tools and structures.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent)
The player should move east towards the tree to collect wood, which will help them in crafting a table and the necessary
tools.
2. Priority 2: Do (Chop tree) (Requirement: Facing tree; have necessary tool or bare hands)
Once the player is near the tree, they should chop down the tree using their hands or any available tool to collect wood.
3. Priority 3: Place Table (Requirement: Wood in inventory)
After collecting wood, the player should place a table using the wood in their inventory. This table will help the player
create the required tools.
16

--- PAGE 17 ---
4. Priority 4: Make Wood Pickaxe (Requirement: Nearby table; wood in inventory)
Using the table, the player should craft a wood pickaxe, which will help them collect resources more efficiently.
5. Priority 5: Collect Wood using Wood Pickaxe (Requirement: Facing the tree, having the wood pickaxe)
With the wood pickaxe, the player can chop down trees and collect wood faster, allowing them to craft more tools and
structures for survival.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move East: Yes, the requirement is met. The player’s most recent observation states they’re facing grass towards the east,
indicating there’s a flat ground on the east side.
2. Do (Chop tree): No, the requirement is not met yet. The player needs to move closer to the tree (3 steps to the east) and
face it to meet the requirement for chopping down the tree.
3. Place Table: No, the requirement is not met. The player needs to collect wood by chopping the tree first.
4. Make Wood Pickaxe: No, the requirement is not met. The player needs to collect wood and place a table to craft a wood
pickaxe.
5. Collect Wood using Wood Pickaxe: No, the requirement is not met. The player needs to create a wood pickaxe first and then
face a tree to collect wood with the pickaxe.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_east) succeeded because there was flat ground (grass) to the east, allowing the player to
move in that direction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is "Move East" as its requirement (flat ground right to the agent) is met
according to the player’s most recent observation.

stone. You currently do not have any pickaxe in your inventory.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Collect wood from the nearby tree (Priority: 5/5) - This is the most essential sub-task, as wood is the basic resource
needed to craft tools and weapons, such as a wood pickaxe, which would enable collecting stone.
2. Craft a wood pickaxe after collecting wood (Priority: 4/5) - Crafting a wood pickaxe will be necessary to efficiently
mine stone, another important resource for crafting better tools and building structures.
17

--- PAGE 18 ---
3. Obtain meat from the nearby cow (Priority: 3/5) - While not as immediately essential as collecting wood or crafting tools,
obtaining meat from the cow will help ensure a steady food supply and keep the player’s food level at a safe point.
Having a weapon like a wood sword would be helpful, but not strictly necessary for this sub-task.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The top sub-task is to collect wood from the nearby tree.
Requirements:
- Be close enough to the tree in order to interact with it.
As the tree is 2 steps to the east of the player, the first thing the player should do is move east to get closer to the
tree until they are adjacent to it. Then, they can start interacting with the tree to collect wood.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move East (Action 2) - The requirement is that there is flat ground to the east of the player.
2. Priority 2: Move East (Action 2) - The requirement is that there is flat ground to the east of the player, and the tree
is not yet adjacent.
3. Priority 3: Do (Action 5) - The requirements are facing the tree (which is now adjacent after moving east) and not having
any necessary tool since collecting wood doesn’t require a specific tool.
4. Priority 4: Place Table (Action 8) - The requirement is having wood in the inventory (after collecting wood from the tree
).
5. Priority 5: Make Wood Pickaxe (Action 11) - The requirement is being near the placed table and having wood in the
inventory.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move East (Action 2) - Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (grass) to the player’s east.
2. Priority 2: Move East (Action 2) - Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (grass) to the player’s east and
the tree is still two steps away.
3. Priority 3: Do (Action 5) - Not yet, as the player needs to move east one more step to be adjacent to the tree, then this
requirement will be met.
4. Priority 4: Place Table (Action 8) - Not yet, as the player needs to collect wood from the tree first. Once wood is
collected, this requirement will be met.
5. Priority 5: Make Wood Pickaxe (Action 11) - Not yet, as the player needs to place a table and have wood in the inventory.
Once a table is placed, and wood is in the inventory, this requirement will be met.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action "move_east" succeeded because there was flat ground (grass) in the direction the player wanted
to move (east) and no obstacles were mentioned preventing the movement.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
37

--- PAGE 38 ---
1. Craft a wood pickaxe (Priority: 5/5) - Crafting a wood pickaxe will allow you to collect important resources such as
stone, coal, and iron. Since you have wood in your inventory and are close to a table, you can craft a wood pickaxe.
2. Collect stone (Priority: 4/5) - Once you have crafted a wood pickaxe, your next priority should be to gather stone. Stone
is a valuable resource for crafting higher-tier tools, weapons, and building structures. You can then use collected
stone to craft a stone pickaxe and other items.
3. Collect coal (Priority: 3/5) - After crafting a wood pickaxe and collecting stone, you should focus on collecting coal.
Coal is essential for smelting metals (such as iron) and crafting torches, both of which will be important as you
progress in the game.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The requirements for the top sub-task, crafting a wood pickaxe, are:
1. Having wood in your inventory: You already have 1 wood in your inventory.
2. Being near a table: The table is 2 steps to your south-east.
To complete this sub-task, you should first move to the table. To do that, take these steps:
1. Move east (facing east): The path 1 step to your east.
2. Move south-east (facing south): The table 1 step to your south.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent)
2. Priority 2: Move South-East (Requirement: Flat ground below and to the right of the agent)
3. Priority 3: Place Table (Requirement: Wood in inventory)
4. Priority 4: Make Wood Pickaxe (Requirement: Nearby table and wood in inventory)
5. Priority 5: Move North-East (Requirement: Flat ground above and to the right of the agent, to get closer to stone for
future actions)
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met as there is a path 2
steps to the north-east, so directly to the east should be flat ground.
2. Priority 2: Move South-East (Requirement: Flat ground below and to the right of the agent) - We don’t have enough
information to determine if the requirement is met.
3. Priority 3: Place Table (Requirement: Wood in inventory) - Yes, the requirement is met as the player has 1 piece of wood
in their inventory.
4. Priority 4: Make Wood Pickaxe (Requirement: Nearby table and wood in inventory) - Partially met. The player has wood in
their inventory, but a table is not placed yet.
5. Priority 5: Move North-East (Requirement: Flat ground above and to the right of the agent, to get closer to stone for
future actions) - Yes, the requirement is met as there is a path 2 steps to the north-east, so directly to the north-
east should be flat ground.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action "move_south" succeeded because there was flat ground (grass) in the direction the player moved (
south), allowing the movement to happen without any obstacles.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list is Priority 1: Move East, since its requirement (flat ground right to the agent) is
met, and it aligns with the player’s objectives of getting closer to stone and other resources.

These actions will ensure that the player collects the coal needed for the game progression and allow them to move on to
other tasks, such as smelting iron and crafting more advanced tools and weapons.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move North: (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
Yes, the requirement is met as there is a path 1 step to the player’s north, indicating flat ground.
2. Priority 2 - Move North: (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
Based on the current observation, we don’t have enough information regarding the second step to the north. It will depend
on the new observation after the player follows the first action.
3. Priority 3 - Move North: (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
Similar to the second action, we don’t have enough information based on the current observation for the third step to the
north. It will depend on new observations after following the first two actions.
4. Priority 4 - Do: (Requirement: Facing the coal and have a wood_pickaxe)
Requirements for this action will be checked after the first three actions are completed. The player already has a
wood_pickaxe in their inventory.
5. Priority 5 - Move South: (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent)
This action should be possible once the player has reached the coal and collected it, as they’ll be moving back to where
they already navigated.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?

- Tree: No, the requirement of having a pickaxe to collect wood is not met since you have a wood pickaxe (not suitable for
chopping trees). You need an axe.
- Coal: Yes, the requirement to use a wood pickaxe or better is met, as you have a wood_pickaxe in your inventory.
- Iron: No, the requirement to use a stone pickaxe or better is not met since you have a wood_pickaxe in your inventory. You
need a stone pickaxe or better.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Collect coal (Priority: 5/5) - You meet the requirement of having a wood_pickaxe, so you can collect coal. Coal will be
useful for smelting iron and cooking food later on.
2. Collect stone (Priority: 4/5) - You meet the requirement of having a wood_pickaxe, so you can collect stone. Collecting
stone allows you to craft a stone pickaxe, necessary to mine iron.
3. Make a stone pickaxe (Priority: 3/5) - Once you collect enough stone, you should make a stone pickaxe at the table. This
will allow you to collect iron and progress further in the game.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The top sub-task is to collect coal. Here are the requirements for this task:
- Have a wood_pickaxe or better tool (which you already have in your inventory)
As the player is already facing coal and has a wood_pickaxe, they can proceed directly to the task. The player should
perform the following action first:
- Take the action "do" to use the wood_pickaxe to collect coal.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Action "do" - Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool. (The player is currently facing
iron and has a wood pickaxe, so they can use it to collect coal first.)
2. Priority 2: Action "make_iron_pickaxe" - Requirement: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, and iron in inventory. (After
collecting coal, the player should gather iron to craft an iron pickaxe.)
3. Priority 3: Action "make_iron_sword" - Requirement: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, and iron in inventory. (Once the
player has enough resources, they can craft an iron sword to defend against monsters more efficiently.)
4. Priority 4: Action "collect_diamond" - Requirement: Make Iron Pickaxe. (With an iron pickaxe, the player can look for and
mine diamonds to progress further in the game.)
5. Priority 5: Action "move_south" - Requirement: Flat ground below the agent. (The player might need to explore new areas.
This movement can be alternated with other directions - move_west, move_east, move_north - to find diamonds and other
resources.)
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Action "do" - The requirement is met, as the player is currently facing iron and has a wood_pickaxe in their
inventory. They can use the wood_pickaxe to collect the iron.
2. Priority 2: Action "make_iron_pickaxe" - The requirements are not yet met, as the player still needs to collect coal and
iron. The player should focus on gathering coal and iron before attempting to make an iron pickaxe.
3. Priority 3: Action "make_iron_sword" - The requirements are not yet met, as the player currently has only a wood_pickaxe
and needs to collect coal and iron to craft an iron sword.
4. Priority 4: Action "collect_diamond" - The requirement is not met, as the player needs to first create an iron pickaxe to
mine diamonds.
5. Priority 5: Action "move_south" - The requirement is met, as there is flat ground below the agent. The player can move
south to explore new areas or search for resources.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action, move_north, succeeded because the player had a flat ground space available towards the north.
This allowed the player to move in that direction without any hindrances.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Action "do" - Since the player is facing iron and has a
wood_pickaxe in their inventory, they can use it to collect the iron.

better tools and weapons.
3. Mine and Collect Wood (Priority 3): Interact with the tree to collect wood resources, which are essential for crafting
items, tools, and building structures.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The requirements for the top sub-task (Craft a Stone Pickaxe) are:
1. Mine Stone: Use the wood_pickaxe to mine nearby stone. The player sees stone 2 steps to their south-east.
2. Access a Table: There is a table 2 steps to the player’s south. They need to be close to the table to craft a
stone_pickaxe.
The player should first move towards the stone (south-east) and mine it using their wood_pickaxe to collect enough stone
resources for crafting a stone_pickaxe.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move South-East: This action has a flat ground requirement. The player needs to move south-east to approach
the stone visible 2 steps away in that direction.
47

--- PAGE 48 ---
2. Priority 2 - Do: Facing the creature or material and having the necessary tool are the requirements. In this case, the
player should use their wood_pickaxe to mine the stone they approached in the previous step.
3. Priority 3 - Move South: Flat ground is required. Since the table is 2 steps to the player’s south, moving south will
bring the player closer to the table, which is needed for crafting.
4. Priority 4 - Make Stone Pickaxe: The requirements are that there must be a nearby table and that the player has wood and
stone in their inventory. After collecting the stone in the previous steps, the player can now craft a stone_pickaxe
while being close to the table.
5. Priority 5 - Drink: To restore the drink meter before it drops too low, the player needs to find a drinkable water source.
This action requires a drink source like a lake or river within reach.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move South-East: Yes, the requirement of flat ground is met as there is a path one step to the player’s east
and stone two steps to the player’s south-east.
2. Priority 2 - Do: Not yet, as the player has not moved to the stone yet. Once the player moves to the stone, the
requirements of facing the material (stone) and having the necessary tool (wood_pickaxe) will be met.
3. Priority 3 - Move South: Yes, the requirement of flat ground is met. The table being two steps to the player’s south
indicates that it is reachable.
4. Priority 4 - Make Stone Pickaxe: Not yet, as the player has not collected the stone yet. Once the player moves to the
stone and collects it using the wood_pickaxe, the requirements of a nearby table and having wood and stone in the
inventory will be met.
5. Priority 5 - Drink: No, the current observation does not provide information about a drinkable water source. The player
needs to find a lake or river within reach before this requirement will be met.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action of "move_north" succeeded. In Player Observation Step 50, we can see that the player has moved
to a new position facing the iron to their north. The action succeeded because there was likely flat ground to the
north allowing the player to move in that direction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1 - Move South-East. The requirement of flat ground is met, and
this action will bring the player closer to the stone they need to collect.

Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
Priority 1: Move East - Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent.
Yes, the requirement is met as there is a stone 1 step to the east.
Priority 2: Do - Requirement: Facing creature or material; have a necessary tool.
Since the player is not currently facing the stone (it is 1 step to the east), the requirement is not met yet. The player
needs to complete priority 1 first to face the stone.
Priority 3: Move West - Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent.
Yes, the requirement is met as there is grass 1 step to the west. However, this action should be completed after collecting
the stone (after completing priority 1 and 2).
Priority 4: Make Stone Pickaxe - Requirement: Nearby table; wood, stone in inventory.
Currently, the player has only a wooden pickaxe in their inventory but not the required materials to craft a stone pickaxe (
wood and stone). The requirement is not met yet. The player needs to collect stone in priority 2.
Priority 5: Move North - Requirement: Flat ground above the agent.
Yes, the requirement is met as there is a path 1 step to the north. However, this action should be taken after completing
priorities 1, 2, 3, and 4 to make the best use of resources and available tools.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The requirements for the top sub-task, which is collecting more stone, are:
1. The player must have a wood_pickaxe (already in the player’s inventory).
2. The player should be facing the stone or be able to reach it.
The player should first move to the position of the stone, which is 2 steps to the south-east. Here’s what the player should

Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move South (Move_South) - Requirement: Flat ground below the agent.
2. Priority 2: Do (Do) - Requirement: Facing stone and have the necessary tool (wood_pickaxe) to collect it.
3. Priority 3: Move North (Move_North) - Requirement: Flat ground above the agent.

5. Priority 5: Collect Iron (Do) - Requirement: Facing iron and have the necessary tool (stone_pickaxe) to collect it.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move South (Move_South) - Yes, the requirement is met. There is flat ground below the agent with a table 1 step to the
south.
2. Do (Do) - Yes, the requirement is met. The agent is facing the path at their front (east), but they could face stone by
moving south, and they have a wood_pickaxe in their inventory to collect the stone.
3. Move North (Move_North) - Yes, the requirement is met. There is flat ground above the agent with a path 1 step to the
north.
4. Make Stone Pickaxe (Make_Stone_Pickaxe) - Yes, the requirements are met. The agent is next to a table (1 step to the
south) and has wood and stone in their inventory.
5. Collect Iron (Do) - No, the requirement is not met. The agent must have a stone_pickaxe to collect iron, but they
currently only have a wood_pickaxe in their inventory. They should first make a stone_pickaxe (Priority 4 action)
before they can collect iron.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action succeeded. The player used the "do" action while facing stone with a wood_pickaxe in their
inventory, allowing them to successfully collect the stone (1 stone added to the inventory).

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 5/5: Collect Iron - Collecting iron will allow you to upgrade your tools and weapons, making it easier to defend
yourself and progress further in the game. Since you have crafted a stone_pickaxe, you can now collect iron.
2. Priority 4/5: Collect Coal - Coal is essential for smelting iron and cooking food. Collecting coal with your wood_pickaxe
will help you smelt the iron you collect and improve your resources.
3. Priority 3/5: Collect Wood - Wood is a basic resource needed for crafting new tools, weapons, and building materials.
Collecting more wood from the nearby tree will ensure you have enough to craft any necessary items as you progress.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (Collect Iron):
- Make a Stone Pickaxe: You have already crafted a stone pickaxe in Player Observation Step 58.
What should the player do first:
- Move towards the iron: In the Player Observation Step 58, you see iron 2 steps to your north. You should move north twice
to reach the iron.
- Collect the iron: Once you are adjacent to the iron, use your stone_pickaxe to collect it by taking action ’do’. This will
add the iron resource to your inventory.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
- Move North twice to reach the iron.
2. Priority 2: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool)
- Use the stone_pickaxe to collect the iron once you are adjacent to it.
3. Priority 3: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
- Move North to get close to the coal.
4. Priority 4: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool)
- Use the wood_pickaxe to collect the coal once you are adjacent to it.
5. Priority 5: Make Iron Pickaxe (Requirement: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, iron in inventory)
- Craft an Iron Pickaxe once you have collected enough iron and coal, and are close to a table and furnace.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
- Yes, the requirement is met, as there is flat ground above the agent.
2. Priority 2: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool)
- The requirement is not met yet because the player needs to move north first and face the iron before using the
stone_pickaxe to collect it.
3. Priority 3: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
- Yes, the requirement is met, as there is flat ground above the agent.
4. Priority 4: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool)
- The requirement is not met yet because the player needs to move north first and face the coal before using the
wood_pickaxe to collect it.
5. Priority 5: Make Iron Pickaxe (Requirement: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, iron in inventory)
- The requirement is not met yet because the player has not collected iron and coal. Once the player collects these
resources and is near a table and furnace, this requirement will be met.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Based on the observations provided, we cannot determine if the last action taken by the player to "make_stone_pickaxe" was
successful or not. The observation report in Step 58 is the same as in Step 56, but we would need information about
any changes in the inventory or messages from the game (e.g., "stone_pickaxe" added to inventory or a "failed" message
) to verify if the action was actually successful.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent). The
requirement is met, so the player can move closer to the iron and coal.

Answer:
It is not explicitly stated whether the "do" action succeeded or not. However, since the inventory and status of the player
did not change between Step 60 and Step 62, it is possible that the action did not succeed. This might be because the
player does not have the necessary tool (a stone pickaxe or better) to collect iron, and they attempted to collect
iron with a wood pickaxe which is not sufficient for that task.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move West. The requirement for this action, flat ground to the

To fulfill the requirement, the player should:
1. Craft a stone_pickaxe, which requires the player to be near the table.
So, the player should first move to the table located 4 steps to their south-east and then craft a stone_pickaxe using the
stone they have in their inventory.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent)
2. Priority 2: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent)
3. Priority 3: Make Stone Pickaxe (Requirement: Nearby table; wood, stone in inventory)
4. Priority 4: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
5. Priority 5: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent)
These actions will guide the player towards the table, craft a stone_pickaxe, and then move towards the iron so they can
collect it.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met, as the path is 2 steps
to the south-east.

2. Priority 2: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met, as the path is 2 steps
to the south-east.
3. Priority 3: Make Stone Pickaxe (Requirement: Nearby table; wood, stone in inventory) - No, the requirement is not met, as
the table is 4 steps away to the south-east, and the player needs to move closer to the table first.
4. Priority 4: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met, as there is grass at the
front (north).
5. Priority 5: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met, as the path is 2 steps
to the south-east.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_north) succeeded. This is because there was flat ground (grass) in front of the player,
which was a valid and open space for the player to move into.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from above is Priority 1: Move East since its requirement (flat ground right to the agent) is
currently met.

Answer:
Move North
Question: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its
requirement.
Answer:
1. Grass: Provides no resources. No requirements.
2. Stone: Provides stone resources. Requires a wood_pickaxe or better to collect.
3. Path: Provides no resources. No requirements.
4. Tree: Provides wood resources. Requires a wood_pickaxe or better to collect.
5. Coal: Provides coal resources. Requires a wood_pickaxe or better to collect.
6. Iron: Provides iron resources. Requires a stone_pickaxe or better to collect.
7. Table: Provides crafting functionality. Requires placing with wood in the inventory.
Question: What was the last action taken by the player?
Answer:
The last action taken by the player was move_east.
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
1. Grass: There are no requirements for interaction, so the requirements are met.
2. Stone: Requires a wood_pickaxe or better to collect. You have a wood_pickaxe in your inventory, so the requirements are
met.
3. Path: There are no requirements for interaction, so the requirements are met.
4. Tree: Requires a wood_pickaxe or better to collect. You have a wood_pickaxe in your inventory, so the requirements are
met.
5. Coal: Requires a wood_pickaxe or better to collect. You have a wood_pickaxe in your inventory, so the requirements are
met.
6. Iron: Requires a stone_pickaxe or better to collect. You only have a wood_pickaxe in your inventory, so the requirements
are not met.
7. Table: Requires placing with wood in the inventory. In this observation, placement is not required as the table is
already placed, so the requirements for interaction are met.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Collect Coal: Priority 4/5. Since you have a wood_pickaxe and are near coal, it’s a good opportunity to collect the coal
for later usage, such as smelting iron.
2. Collect more Stone: Priority 3/5. With the wood_pickaxe in your inventory, collecting more stone is possible, allowing
you to craft a stone_pickaxe to collect iron later.
3. Move closer to the Table: Priority 2/5. As a crafting station, the table is important for future crafting activities, so
being close to it can be helpful when you need to craft new items or tools.
Note that the priorities are subjective and might vary according to the player’s preferences and goals. The top sub-tasks
listed here are based on the current observation and resources available.

- No, the requirement is not met as there is an iron block to the east.
3. Priority 3: Do (Action 5)
Requirement: Facing the coal; have a wood_pickaxe in inventory (which you already have).
- No, the requirement is not met as you are currently facing the iron block, not the coal.
4. Priority 4: Move to the table (Follow steps to reach the table)
Requirements: Flat ground in the direction of the table.
- To determine if the requirements are met, you need to assess the current state and surrounding environment. In the current
state, the table is 4 steps to your south-east, which means, you need to move around to get to it. As of now, in the
current state, the path to the table is not obstructed, and you can move south-east.
5. Priority 5: Make Iron Pickaxe (Action 13)
Requirements: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, and iron in inventory.
- No, the requirements are not met as you currently only have a wood_pickaxe and stone in your inventory. You will need coal
and iron, as well as a furnace, to make the iron pickaxe.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action succeeded because the player moved from their previous position to the east, where they are now
facing iron. This indicates that there was flat ground to the east, allowing the player to move in that direction
successfully.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from above is Priority 1: Move North (Action 3) since the requirement of flat ground above the
agent is met.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Craft a Stone Pickaxe (Priority: 5): Since the player already has a wood pickaxe, the next step is to upgrade to a stone
pickaxe for better efficiency in mining and to be able to collect iron. The player can use the stone pickaxe to
further progress in the game, as it unlocks more crafting options.
2. Collect Coal (Priority: 4): Coal is essential for fueling furnaces, and the player has a wood pickaxe, which can be used
to collect coal. By collecting coal, the player can smelt iron and other ores, which are necessary for crafting higher
-tier tools, weapons, and armor.
3. Collect Iron (Priority: 3): The player will need to collect iron to craft advanced tools and weapons, which are essential
for better survival chances and to progress in the game. However, the player must craft a stone pickaxe first to be
able to collect iron.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The top sub-task is to craft a Stone Pickaxe. The requirements for this task are:
1. Collect Stone: The player needs to have enough stone in their inventory to craft a stone pickaxe. They already have 1
stone, but may need more, depending on the crafting recipe in the game.
2. Place Table (Crafting Table): The player needs to have a crafting table placed nearby to perform the crafting action for
making a stone pickaxe.
What the player should do first:
1. If the player does not have a crafting table yet, they should collect enough wood and craft a table (crafting table)
first, and then place it in a convenient location.
2. If more stone is required, the player should use their wood_pickaxe to mine additional stone.
3. Once the player has enough stone and access to a crafting table, they should craft the stone pickaxe.

for creating better tools and weapons. The player has the necessary wood_pickaxe and stone in their inventory to
craft it near a table.
2. Collect iron (Priority: 4/5): Once the player has crafted a stone_pickaxe, they should collect iron to be able to craft
upgraded tools and weapons. Iron is 2 steps to the south in the current observation.
3. Defeat the cow for food (Priority: 3/5): With sufficient food, the player can maintain their health and stay active in
the game. The cow is 6 steps to their north-west, and while a weapon like a sword would be useful, it is not strictly

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The requirements for the top sub-task (Craft a stone_pickaxe) are:
1. A nearby table: The player must be close to a table to craft a stone_pickaxe.
2. Stone in the inventory: The player needs to have stone in their inventory to create the tool.
3. Wood_pickaxe: Since the player already has a wood_pickaxe, they will be able to collect more stone if needed.
The first thing the player should do is find or craft a table. As we don’t have any information about a table being nearby,
the player should craft a table by placing it, as they have enough wood in their inventory to do so (mentioned in
Player Observation Step 88). Once the table is crafted and placed, the player can then craft the stone_pickaxe.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Place Table (Requirement: Wood in inventory)

Player Observation Step 88).
2. Priority 2: Make Stone Pickaxe (Requirements: Nearby table; wood, stone in inventory)
After crafting the table, the player should use it to craft the stone_pickaxe. They have enough wood and stone in their
inventory (based on Player Observation Step 90).
3. Priority 3: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent)
The player should move south to get closer to both coal and iron resources since they will need more coal and iron for
future crafting.
4. Priority 4: Do (Facing coal; wood_pickaxe or stone_pickaxe in hand)
The player should mine the coal once they are adjacent to it. They require a wood_pickaxe or stone_pickaxe to mine the coal.
The player currently has the wood_pickaxe and will have the stone_pickaxe after performing Priority 2.
5. Priority 5: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent)
After collecting coal, the player should continue moving south toward the iron resource to mine it next.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Place Table (Requirement: Wood in inventory)
Yes, the requirement is met. Based on Player Observation Step 88, the player has wood in their inventory.
2. Priority 2: Make Stone Pickaxe (Requirements: Nearby table; wood, stone in inventory)

Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move North-East (Move towards the stone)
Requirement: Flat ground in the north-east direction.
Status: Requirement met (stone is 2 steps to the north-east)
2. Priority 2: Do (Mine the stone using the wooden pickaxe)
Requirement: Facing the stone and having a wooden pickaxe in the inventory.
Status: Requirement NOT met (currently facing iron, not stone)
3. Priority 3: Move to Crafting Table (Move towards a crafting table or find a suitable place to place one)
Requirement: Flat ground in the direction of a crafting table or a suitable location.
Status: Requirement met (path 1 step to the east, suitable location for a crafting table)
4. Priority 4: Place Table (Place a crafting table)
Requirement: Wood in the inventory (if a crafting table isn’t already present at the location).
Status: Requirement NOT met (no wood currently in the inventory)
5. Priority 5: Make Stone Pickaxe (Craft the stone pickaxe)
Requirement: Nearby table and at least 3 pieces of stone and 1 piece of wood in the inventory.
Status: Requirement NOT met (currently have only 2 stones and no wood in inventory, no table mentioned in the observation)
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
It is unclear if the last player action succeeded, as there is no change in the player’s inventory or observations between
Step 94 and Step 96. The player’s wood_pickaxe should be sufficient to mine iron, but without more information, we
cannot determine if the action succeeded or failed.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 5/5: Craft a stone_pickaxe to collect iron - Find or gather more stone to meet the requirements for crafting a
stone_pickaxe. Having a stone_pickaxe will allow you to collect iron.
2. Priority 4/5: Collect wood from the nearby tree - Wood is necessary for crafting various tools and building materials. As
there is a nearby tree, it would be convenient to collect more wood.
3. Priority 3/5: Find a water source to drink - Your drink level is a little low (7/9). To increase this, you should locate
a water source and drink water to replenish your drink level.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The requirements for the top sub-task, crafting a stone_pickaxe, are:
1. Collect at least 3 units of stone - The player has 2 units of stone in their inventory; they need to collect one more
unit.
2. Have a wood_pickaxe - The player already meets this requirement with 1 wood_pickaxe in their inventory.
3. Access to a crafting table - The player can craft a table using wood and place it, or they can find an existing crafting
table.
The player should first find and interact with the nearby stone by using their wood_pickaxe to gather at least one more unit
of stone. This way, they will have enough stone to craft the stone_pickaxe.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move East: The player needs to be on flat ground to their right (east) to complete this action. This will
get the player closer to the stone that they need to collect.
2. Priority 2 - Do: The player must face the stone and have the necessary tool (wood_pickaxe) to collect it. Since the
player already has a wood_pickaxe in their inventory, they can collect the stone by completing this action.
3. Priority 3 - Move West: To return to their initial position, the player needs flat ground to their left (west).
4. Priority 4 - Place Table: The player must have wood in their inventory to complete this action. They should place the
table to create a crafting surface.
5. Priority 5 - Make Stone Pickaxe: The player needs access to a table, and they should have at least 3 units of stone in
their inventory by now. Crafting a stone_pickaxe requires the table and the stone they’ve collected.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move East: Yes, the requirement for flat ground to the player’s right (east) is met, as there is a path 1 step to the
player’s east.
2. Do (Collect Stone): No, the requirement for facing the stone is not met. The player must face east to face the stone
instead of facing grass (north) as they currently are.
3. Move West: Yes, the requirement for flat ground to the player’s left (west) is met, as there is grass 1 step to the
player’s west.
4. Place Table: No, the requirement for having wood in the player’s inventory is not met. The player must collect wood first.
5. Make Stone Pickaxe: No, the requirements for having access to a table and 3 units of stone in the inventory are not met.
The player must first collect more stone and wood, then craft and place a table.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action "move_north" succeeded because there was flat ground (grass) on the north side of the player,
allowing them to move in that direction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is to "Move East" because the requirement of flat ground to the player’s
right (east) is met, as there is a path 1 step to the player’s east.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The top sub-task is crafting a stone_pickaxe. The requirements for this task are:
1. Having wood and stone in your inventory. (You already have 2 stones, but you need wood.)
2. Being near a table to craft the pickaxe.
Before the player can craft a stone_pickaxe, they should first collect wood which is a necessary resource for crafting. The
wood can be collected by approaching a tree (there’s one 2 steps to the west) and using the wood_pickaxe. After
collecting wood, the player should ensure that they are near a table to craft the stone_pickaxe. If there is no table
nearby, the player may need to place one using the wood they collected.

5. Priority 5: Move South-East (Requirement: Flat ground below and right to the agent)
Reason: To get closer to iron (3 steps to your south-east) after crafting the stone_pickaxe, which will be used to collect
iron.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move West: Yes, the requirement of flat ground left to the agent is met since the player faces grass to the west.
2. Do: Not yet, the player needs to be facing the tree and have the required tool (wood_pickaxe is in inventory) to collect
wood.
3. Place Table: No, the requirement of having wood in the inventory is not met. The player needs to collect wood first.
4. Make Stone Pickaxe: Not yet, the player needs a nearby table for crafting, and although stone is in the inventory, the
player needs to collect wood and place the table first.
5. Move South-East: Yes, the requirement for the flat ground below, and right to the agent is met; this direction leads
towards the iron. However, the player should first complete the crafting of a stone_pickaxe before collecting iron.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action "move_west" succeeded because the player was able to move from facing stone to facing grass, as
mentioned in the observations. There was flat ground (grass) to the west of the player, which allowed the player to
move in that direction successfully.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is "Move West" because the requirement of flat ground left to the agent is
met and it brings the player closer to the tree to collect wood, which is essential for crafting and progressing in
the game.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Create a stone_pickaxe:
Priority: 5/5
85

--- PAGE 86 ---
Reason: A stone_pickaxe will allow you to mine iron ore and collect more resources efficiently. Since you have the
necessary stone and a wood_pickaxe, crafting a stone_pickaxe should be your top priority.
2. Collect more wood:
Priority: 4/5
Reason: Wood is essential for crafting numerous items and tools in the game. You’re currently facing a tree, and although
you don’t have an axe, you can still collect wood using your hands or another tool.
3. Pursue and kill a cow for food and leather:
Priority: 3/5
Reason: Your food level is 7/9, and killing a cow will provide meat for sustenance and leather for armor. It’s not a top
priority but still important to ensure your survival in the game. Using a weapon like a sword will make this task
more efficient.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Top Sub-task: Create a stone_pickaxe
Requirements:
1. A crafting table - You need a crafting table to create more advanced tools like the stone_pickaxe.
2. Stone - You already have two pieces of stone in your inventory, which is sufficient to craft a stone_pickaxe.
3. Wood - You need wood or wooden planks to create tool handles. Since you already have a wood_pickaxe, it is likely you
have crafted with wood before, so it is assumed you know the process of turning wood into planks.
What should the player do first?
1. Build a crafting table if you haven’t already. To craft a table, collect wood from a tree, convert the wood into wooden
planks, and then use four wooden planks to craft a table.
2. Once the crafting table is built, place it in front of you (if not already there).
3. Interact with the crafting table, and use the available stone and wood in your inventory to create a stone_pickaxe.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent.)

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Gather more wood by cutting down the tree you are facing (Priority: 5/5) - Wood is essential for crafting more tools,
weapons, and building structures.
2. Mine more stone with your wood pickaxe (Priority: 4/5) - Stone is needed for crafting better tools such as a stone
pickaxe, which is necessary for mining iron.
3. Defeat the cow nearby to collect meat (Priority: 3/5) - The meat will provide food to restore health when needed.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (Gather more wood by cutting down the tree):
1. Face a tree - The player is currently facing a tree, so this requirement is met.
2. Have a tool capable of cutting wood - The player has a wood_pickaxe in their inventory.
Since the player is already facing a tree and has a wood_pickaxe in their inventory, they can proceed with the sub-task.
The player should take the following action first:
- Use the wood_pickaxe on the tree to gather wood.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Do - Use the wood_pickaxe on the tree to gather wood.
Requirement: Facing a tree and have a wood_pickaxe in your inventory (both requirements are currently met).
2. Priority 2: Move East - Move closer to the stone and other resources.
Requirement: Flat ground to the east of the player.
3. Priority 3: Make Stone Pickaxe - Craft a better pickaxe for gathering resources like iron.

Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
It is impossible to determine if the last player action succeeded since both Player Observation Step 104 and Player
Observation Step 106 are identical. The situation remains the same in both steps, which indicates that either the
action was unsuccessful, or the environment and player’s status did not change as a result of the action. It’s
recommended to check the game’s feedback or response after each action to understand if the action succeeded or not.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.

actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move South-East (Action 4 - Move South): Requirement: Flat ground below the agent.
91

--- PAGE 92 ---
Reason: To navigate towards the iron deposit in the south-east direction, the player should first move one step to the
south.
2. Priority 2: Move East (Action 2 - Move East): Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent.
Reason: After moving south, move one step to the east to reach the iron deposit.
3. Priority 3: Do (Action 5 - Do): Requirement: Facing iron ore and equipped with the necessary tool (stone_pickaxe).
Reason: Use the stone_pickaxe to mine the iron ore once adjacent to it.
4. Priority 4: Move West (Action 1 - Move West): Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent.
Reason: After collecting the iron ore, move back to the previously placed table, which will require moving one step to the
west.
5. Priority 5: Make Iron Pickaxe (Action 13 - Make Iron Pickaxe): Requirement: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, and iron
in inventory.
Reason: With iron ore in inventory, the next priority is to craft a more durable and efficient iron pickaxe using the
table and furnace.

1. Priority 1: Move South-East (Action 4 - Move South): The requirement of having a flat ground below the agent is met, as
there is no obstacle mentioned in the observation.
2. Priority 2: Move East (Action 2 - Move East): The requirement for this action is met as well, since the player will be on
flat ground after moving south in the previous step.
3. Priority 3: Do (Action 5 - Do): The requirement is currently not met, as the player first needs to move south and east to
reach the iron ore deposit. Once the player is adjacent to the iron ore deposit and equipped with the stone_pickaxe,
the requirement will be met.
4. Priority 4: Move West (Action 1 - Move West): Once the player has moved south and east, this requirement will be met, as
the player will be on flat ground after moving back to the table.
5. Priority 5: Make Iron Pickaxe (Action 13 - Make Iron Pickaxe): The player has a nearby table placed, but the furnace’s
presence is not mentioned. The coal and wood requirements are met, but the player first needs to mine the iron to meet
the iron requirement. The action is partially viable, and the player should focus on mining the iron and setting up a
furnace to meet all the requirements.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action succeeded. The player placed a table because they had enough wood in their inventory (1 wood)
and met the requirements to place the table.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move South (Action 4 - Move South), as its requirement of
having flat ground below the agent is currently met. This action takes the player towards the iron deposit.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Collect Iron (Priority: 5/5): Collect iron using the stone_pickaxe, as it is a valuable resource for crafting stronger
tools and weapons.
2. Collect more Wood (Priority: 4/5): Collect more wood from the nearby tree, as it is a necessary resource for crafting
various objects and building structures.
3. Defeat Cow (Priority: 3/5): Defeat the cow to obtain food to replenish your food level when needed.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (Collect Iron):
- Have a stone pickaxe.
The player already has a stone_pickaxe in their inventory, so they should do the following first:
- Move towards the iron by taking action move_southeast.
- Once near the iron, use the stone_pickaxe to collect the iron.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move Southeast: Flat ground adjacent to the agent in the southeast direction.
Requirement: Move closer to the iron and coal.
2. Priority 2 - Do (Collect Iron): Face the iron and have a stone_pickaxe in the inventory.
Requirement: Collect iron to eventually make an iron pickaxe and sword.
3. Priority 3 - Move West: Flat ground adjacent to the agent in the west direction.
Requirement: Move closer to the tree after collecting iron.
4. Priority 4 - Do (Collect Wood): Face the tree and have a wood or stone pickaxe in the inventory.
Requirement: Collect more wood for crafting tools, weapons or building a table.
5. Priority 5 - Move Northwest: Flat ground adjacent to the agent in the northwest direction.
Requirement: Move closer to the cow, to eventually chase it or eat it for restoring health.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move Southeast: Yes, the requirement is met because the player only needs flat ground in the southeast
direction, which is available.
2. Priority 2 - Do (Collect Iron): No, the requirement is not yet met because the player first needs to move closer to the
iron and equip the stone_pickaxe to collect iron.
94

--- PAGE 95 ---
3. Priority 3 - Move West: Yes, the requirement is met because the player only needs flat ground in the west direction,
which is available.
4. Priority 4 - Do (Collect Wood): No, the requirement is not yet met because the player first needs to move closer to the
tree, and also equip either a wood or stone pickaxe to collect the wood.
5. Priority 5 - Move Northwest: Yes, the requirement is met because the player only needs flat ground in the northwest
direction, which is available.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
I cannot determine if the last player action succeeded because the observation for Step 115 is missing. The observation
jumps from Step 114 to Step 116, skipping the step where the action "make_stone_pickaxe" would be hinged on its
success or failure.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1 - Move Southeast because the requirement is met and it brings
the player closer to important resources such as iron and coal.

2. Use the stone_pickaxe: The player has a stone_pickaxe in their inventory, which is needed to mine the iron ore
efficiently.
To start this sub-task, the player should first move towards the iron ore. As it is 4 steps to the north-east in the current
step, the player should move north-east to get closer to the iron ore. They may have to do a combination of moving
east and moving north or move diagonally if the game allows it. Once they reach the iron ore, they can use the
stone_pickaxe to collect it.

player to mine the iron ore after they have reached it using the stone_pickaxe they already have in their inventory.
4. Priority 4: Move South (Action 4) - Requirement: Flat ground below the agent. This action moves the player back towards
the table after collecting the iron ore so they can craft additional items if needed or progress further in the game.
5. Priority 5: Move West (Action 1) - Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent. This action continues moving the player
back towards the table or allows them to explore other areas after gathering the iron ore.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move North (Action 3) - Yes, the requirements are met as flat ground is mentioned to be 3 steps to the north-
east (path).
2. Priority 2: Move East (Action 2) - Yes, the requirements are met as flat ground is mentioned to have stone 2 steps to the
east.
3. Priority 3: Do (Action 5) - Not yet, the player needs to reach the iron ore first by moving north and east as per
priority 1 and 2 actions. Once the player is facing the iron ore, they have the necessary tool (stone_pickaxe) in
their inventory to mine it.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 5/5: Collect iron. Since you have a stone_pickaxe, you can collect the iron 1 step to the north to craft more
advanced tools and weapons, such as an iron pickaxe or an iron sword.
2. Priority 4/5: Collect coal. With coal in your inventory, you will be able to smelt the iron ore in a furnace. You already
have one coal in your inventory, but collecting more will come in handy for future smelting tasks. The coal is 2
steps to your north-east.
3. Priority 3/5: Chase and kill the cow 7 steps to your north-west to obtain food. Your food level is currently at 7/9, so
it is not an immediate concern. However, collecting food from the cow will be beneficial to keep your food supply
stable. You can interact with the cow without any tools, but crafting a weapon such as a wooden or stone sword may
make the task more efficient.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The top sub-task is to collect iron. The requirements for this task are:
1. Having a stone pickaxe, which you already possess in your inventory.
2. Locating iron ore, which is 1 step to your north.
Since you have met both requirements, the first thing the player should do is move north. Then, the player can use the
stone_pickaxe to collect the iron ore.

3. Move closer to the table and use it for crafting. Priority: 3/5.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Top sub-task: Craft a weapon (wood, stone, or iron sword) to defeat the cow and obtain food.
Requirements:
1. Wood sword: Nearby table and wood in inventory.
2. Stone sword: Nearby table, wood, and stone in inventory.
3. Iron sword: Nearby table, furnace, wood, coal, and iron in inventory.
Since the player has wood, stone, coal, and iron in their inventory, they can craft an iron sword.
First, the player should move closer to the table (move south-east) and use it for crafting the iron sword (make_iron_sword
action).
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move South-East (move_south_east) - Requirement: Flat ground south-east to the agent.
2. Priority 2: Move South-East (move_south_east) - Requirement: Flat ground south-east to the agent after completing the
first action.
3. Priority 3: Make Iron Sword (make_iron_sword) - Requirement: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, and iron in inventory.
4. Priority 4: Move North-West (move_north_west) - Requirement: Flat ground north-west to the agent after crafting the iron
sword.
5. Priority 5: Do (do) using the iron sword to attack the cow - Requirement: Facing the cow and having the iron sword in the
inventory.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move South-East (move_south_east) - Yes, there is flat ground in the south-east direction of the agent.
2. Priority 2: Move South-East (move_south_east) - Cannot determine at this moment, as this depends on the results of the
previous action. If there is still flat ground south-east after completing the first action, then the requirement will
be met.
3. Priority 3: Make Iron Sword (make_iron_sword) - Yes, the agent has a table nearby to the south-east, the agent has the
required materials (wood, coal, and iron) in the inventory, and presumably there will be a furnace nearby after
completing the first two actions of moving south-east.
4. Priority 4: Move North-West (move_north_west) - Cannot determine at this moment, this depends on the results of the
previous actions. If there is a flat ground in the north-west direction of the agent after crafting the iron sword,
then the requirement will be met.
5. Priority 5: Do (do) using the iron sword to attack the cow - Cannot determine at this moment, as this depends on the
results of the previous actions. If the agent is facing the cow after crafting the iron sword and moving north-west,
the requirement will be met, as the agent will have the iron sword in their inventory.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action, move_west, succeeded because there was a flat ground (grass) to the west of the player’s
position, allowing them to move in that direction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move South-East (move_south_east) because its requirements are

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
For the top sub-task of crafting an axe, the requirements are:
1. Having a table placed to craft on.
2. Having sufficient wood or stone (depending on the type of axe being crafted) in the inventory.
3. Accessing the table to create the axe.
Since the player already has a table in front of them, they should perform the following steps:
1. Approach the table.
2. Use the resources in the inventory (wood and/or stone) to craft an axe.
But first, the player must approach the table by interacting with it, which can be done by standing next to it and facing it.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
From the list of all actions, these are the top 5 actions the player should prioritize:
1. Priority 1: Make Stone Axe (Requirement: Nearby table; wood and stone in inventory)
2. Priority 2: Collect more Wood (Requirement: Make Stone Axe or Wood Axe)
3. Priority 3: Make Wood Sword or Stone Sword (Requirement: Nearby table; wood and/or stone in inventory)
4. Priority 4: Collect more Stone (Requirement: Make Stone Pickaxe)
5. Priority 5: Collect Iron (Requirement: Make Stone Pickaxe)
These priorities ensure that the player crafts the necessary tools, gathers resources, and enhances their defensive
capabilities in the game.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
From the most recent player observation and the provided inventory, let’s evaluate each action’s requirements:
1. Make Stone Axe
Requirement: Nearby table; wood and stone in inventory
Status: Not met (player lacks wood and a stone axe is not listed in the actions)
2. Collect more Wood
Requirement: Make Stone Axe or Wood Axe
Status: Not met (player lacks wood to make an axe, and the list of actions does not contain axe crafting)
3. Make Wood Sword or Stone Sword
Requirement: Nearby table; wood and/or stone in inventory
Status: Met for Stone Sword (player has a table nearby and stone in inventory)
4. Collect more Stone
Requirement: Make Stone Pickaxe
Status: Met (player has a stone pickaxe in inventory)
5. Collect Iron
Requirement: Make Stone Pickaxe
Status: Met (player has a stone pickaxe in inventory)
Among the listed actions, actions 3, 4, and 5 have their requirements met. However, it is important to note that the
original list of actions needs to be updated to include axe crafting and resource collection.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
It is ambiguous whether the last player action succeeded or not, as the observations at step 160 and step 162 are identical.
We cannot confirm if the move_south action had any effect on the player’s position in the game or if they reached
their desired location.

tools, weapons, or structures. This will help the player advance and be better equipped to handle any threats.
2. Priority 5/5: Restore food and drink levels
Sub-task: Find a source of food (such as hunting animals or foraging for plants) and water (such as drinking from a lake)
to keep the player’s food and drink levels sustainable. Maintaining proper food and drink levels is crucial for the
player’s survival.
3. Priority 3/5: Explore the surrounding area
Sub-task: Investigate the environment to find valuable resources, potential shelter locations, and detect any possible
threats. Exploring the area can yield new opportunities for resource gathering, maintaining a steady food supply,
or discovering interesting locations.

Top sub-task: Collect more resources.
Requirements:
1. Utilize appropriate tools (wood_pickaxe, stone_pickaxe) to efficiently collect resources.
2. Identify the location of resources (wood from trees, stone from rocks, and iron from iron ores) in the environment.
What the player should do first:
1. Identify the nearest resource locations by observing the surroundings.
2. Move towards the resource location and use the correct tool for the specific resource (e.g., use the wood_pickaxe for
collecting wood and the stone_pickaxe for collecting stone and iron).
3. Continuously keep an eye on the environment for new resource locations or potential threats while gathering.

smelt iron would allow you to craft better items, such as an iron sword or iron pickaxe.
2. Drink water to restore thirst (Priority: 4/5): Your drink level is at 5/9, which means it’s getting low. Finding water to
drink should be a priority to avoid dehydration.
3. Find food to restore hunger (Priority: 4/5): Your food level is at 6/9, so finding a source of food like a cow or a fruit
would help restore your hunger and maintain good health.

The requirements for the top sub-task (smelt iron in the furnace) are:
1. Have a furnace placed (already accomplished).
2. Have coal in your inventory (already accomplished with 2 coal).
3. Have iron in your inventory (already accomplished with 1 iron).
134

--- PAGE 135 ---
As all the requirements are already met, the player should first approach the placed furnace and then use it to smelt the
iron using the coal they have in their inventory. This will create an iron ingot, which can then be used to craft
better items such as an iron sword or an iron pickaxe.

2. Have access to a table - You will need a table nearby to craft the wood_sword.
What the player should do first:
137

--- PAGE 138 ---
Since you already have a table at 2 steps to your south-east, you should collect wood from the tree that is 4 steps to your
north-west. To do this, you can move towards the tree by moving north-west and then use your wood_pickaxe to collect
wood.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent)
Purpose: To move towards the tree to collect wood.
2. Priority 2: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent)
Purpose: To continue moving towards the tree to collect wood.
3. Priority 3: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
Purpose: To reach the tree to collect wood.
4. Priority 4: Do (Facing creature or material; have necessary tool)
Requirement: Face the tree and have wood_pickaxe in inventory.
Purpose: Use wood_pickaxe to collect wood from the tree.
5. Priority 5: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent)
Purpose: To move back towards the table for crafting after collecting wood.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent)
Yes, the requirement is met. The player faces grass, which is flat ground on the left.
2. Priority 2: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent)
The requirement is likely met due to the presence of grass in the front (west). However, the player needs to complete
Priority 1 action and reevaluate the surroundings for flat ground after moving.
3. Priority 3: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
Since the current observation only shows the immediate surroundings, the requirement might be met after moving west twice.
The player needs to update their observation after moving west to confirm if there’s flat ground above.
4. Priority 4: Do (Facing creature or material; have necessary tool)
Requirement: Face the tree and have wood_pickaxe in inventory.
For this action, the player has the required wood_pickaxe in the inventory. However, they need to reach the tree by
completing Priority 1, 2, and 3 actions before they can face the tree and execute this action.
5. Priority 5: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent)
Like Priority 3 action, this action’s requirement will need to be confirmed after the player updates their observation
after completing Priority 1, 2, 3, and 4 actions. Currently, the player’s surroundings aren’t fully known.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action "move_west" succeeded because there were no obstacles or restrictions preventing the player from
moving in that direction, and their energy level allowed them to perform the action.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) as the
requirement is currently met, and it will take the player closer to the tree to collect wood.

1. Finding a water source such as a lake, river, or other body of water.
To complete this top sub-task, the player should do the following first:
1. Explore the surroundings by moving either north, east, or south (since the stone is located to the south-east, the water
source may be found in that direction) in search of a water source. Keep an eye out for visible water sources, and
once found, approach and drink from it to increase the drink level.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

level and restores health points.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?

direction. The observation does not mention any obstacles in the north-west direction, so the requirement is met.
4. Priority 4 - Interact with the Cow: The requirement for interacting with the cow includes facing the cow and having
necessary tools (wood sword, stone sword, or iron sword). The player is not currently facing the cow and does not
possess any swords in the inventory. Therefore, the requirement is not met.
5. Priority 5 - Eat Food: The requirement for eating food is having food in the inventory. The player does not have any food
in the inventory currently, so the requirement is not met.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?

west.
2. Priority 2: Move East (Flat ground right to the agent) - Requirement unknown, as the player observation does not provide
information about the east direction.
3. Priority 3: Move North (Flat ground above the agent) - Requirement already met in the most recent step when the player
moved north. Based on the current player observation, there might still be flat ground to move further north, but it’s
not directly mentioned.
4. Priority 4: Move South (Flat ground below the agent) - The requirement is met since the player has just moved from the
south position and the ground is flat there.
5. Priority 5: Drink (Facing a water source) - The requirement is not met because the player observation does not yet show a
water source.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_north) succeeded because there was flat ground available for the player to move north, as
mentioned in the observation: "path 2 steps to your north-east" and no obstacles were blocking the player’s way.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move West (Flat ground left to the agent) because there is
flat ground (grass) to the west as mentioned in the player’s observation, and it allows the player to explore the
surroundings in search of resources like a water source.

6. Grass: Yes, there are no specific requirements to interact with the grass, and it can be used for various purposes, such
as landscaping or building.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 5/5: Craft a weapon, such as a wood or stone sword, using the table to improve your ability to defeat the cow
and potentially other threats. This will provide you with food and increase your chances of survival.
2. Priority 4/5: Collect wood from the tree using your wood_pickaxe. Wood is an essential resource for crafting and building,
expanding your options for items to use and shelter.
3. Priority 3/5: Collect stone from the stone block using your stone_pickaxe to gather more resources for crafting advanced
tools, weapons, or building materials. This will allow you to progress further in the game and increase your overall

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
For the top sub-task of crafting a weapon (wood or stone sword), the requirements are:
1. Have a nearby table, which is already 2 steps to the south-east of the player.
2. Have the necessary materials in the inventory:
- For a wood sword: wood.
- For a stone sword: wood and stone (you have 1 stone in your inventory already).
Since you don’t have wood in your inventory currently, the first thing you should do is collect wood from the tree 4 steps
to your north-west using your wood_pickaxe. Once you’ve collected enough wood, move to the table, and craft a weapon
of your choice (either a wood or stone sword).
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Gather more wood (Priority: 4/5): Wood is essential for crafting tools and items in the game. You currently do not have
wood in your inventory, making it a high priority to gather more wood for future use.
2. Drink water (Priority: 5/5): Your thirst level is at 5/9, which means it is important to find a water source and drink
from it to restore your thirst and avoid negative effects due to dehydration. This is the highest priority task.
3. Find food (Priority: 3/5): Your food level is currently 6/9, and it is important to maintain a good food supply to avoid
starvation. Although you can see a cow in your surroundings, prioritize finding and hunting animals or harvesting
plants for food to keep your levels up.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The top sub-task is to gather more wood. The requirements for this task are:
1. Find a tree: Trees are the source of wood in the game. Currently, the player can see a tree 4 steps to their north-west.
What the player should do first:
1. Move towards the tree: The player needs to go 4 steps north-west to reach the tree. They can accomplish this by going
west and north alternately or continuously going in one direction, followed by the other until they are in front of
the tree.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - Move towards the tree that is 4 steps to the north-
west.
2. Priority 2: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - Continue moving towards the tree, which is to the
north-west.
3. Priority 3: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - Keep moving towards the tree if it still is not
directly in front of the player.
4. Priority 4: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - Continue moving towards the tree until it is directly
in front of the player.
5. Priority 5: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool) - Use the wood_pickaxe to gather wood from
the tree once the player is facing it.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met as the player is
currently facing grass to the west, which indicates flat ground.
2. Priority 2: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met as the player was able to
move north in the previous step without any issues, indicating flat ground.
3. Priority 3: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met since the player is
facing grass to the west, indicating flat ground.
146

--- PAGE 147 ---
4. Priority 4: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) -Yes, the requirement is met as the player previously
moved north without any issues, indicating flat ground.
5. Priority 5: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool) - This requirement can only be determined
once the player is in front of the tree. If the tree is directly in front of the player, and they have a wood_pickaxe
in their inventory (which they do), then the requirement is met.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action succeeded. The action "move_north" doesn’t have any specific requirements other than having a
flat ground above the agent, and nothing in the observation suggests any obstacle preventing the player from moving
north. Therefore, the action was successful.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move West. The requirement of flat ground left to the agent is
met since the player is facing grass to the west, which indicates flat ground. This action brings the player closer
to the tree, which is 4 steps to the north-west.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (Drink water to restore thirst):
1. Locate a water source such as a lake or river in the game environment.
2. Have enough energy to move towards the water source.
The player should first explore the surrounding area to locate a water source like a lake or river. When found, the player
should move towards it and interact with it to drink water and restore thirst.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move West: Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent. (This is based on the most recent in-game observation
where the player is facing grass (west). Going west would allow the player to explore more and potentially find a
water source.)
2. Priority 2 - Move North: Requirement: Flat ground above of the agent. (Exploring north could increase the chances of
finding a water source, fulfilling the drink objective.)
3. Priority 3 - Move East: Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent. (By exploring east, the player may come across a
water source or other needed resources.)
4. Priority 4 - Move South: Requirement: Flat ground below the agent. (Going south would further the exploration and could
yield a water source or other valuable assets.)
5. Priority 5 - Do (Drink Water): Requirement: Facing a water source like a lake or river at the agent’s front. (This action
would be taken once the player has found a water source and faced it. Drinking water would restore the player’s
thirst levels.)
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move West: Yes, the requirement is met. The player is currently facing grass (west) which indicates flat ground left to
the agent.
2. Move North: Based on the player observation, there is no information about what’s directly north, so it’s unclear if
there is flat ground above the agent. However, there is a path 2 steps to the north-east and a tree 4 steps to the
north-west, which may indicate that moving north could be possible.
3. Move East: Yes, the requirement is met. There is a path 2 steps to the agent’s north-east and flat ground is right to the
agent.
4. Move South: Based on the player observation, there is no information about what’s directly south, so it’s unclear if
there is flat ground below the agent. However, there is a stone 3 steps to the agent’s south-east and a table 2 steps
to the agent’s south-east, which may indicate that moving south could be possible.
5. Do (Drink Water): No, the requirement is not met as the player is currently facing grass (west) and there is no water
source at the agent’s front that the player can drink from. The player must first locate a water source and face it to
fulfill this requirement.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_west) succeeded because there was flat ground to the west of the player, allowing them to
move in that direction without any obstacles.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from above is Move West because the requirement is met, as the player is currently facing grass (
west) which indicates flat ground left to the agent. This action will allow the player to explore and potentially find
valuable resources such as a water source.

What should the player do first:
The player should begin searching for a water source by observing their surroundings and then move toward it. If the player
already knows the location of a nearby water source, such as a lake or river, they should start moving in that
direction. Exploring the environment will help the player locate a suitable water source to replenish their thirst.

Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - The player currently faces grass to the west, and
moving can help them explore the environment and find a water source.
2. Priority 2: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - If west is not the right direction towards a water
source, moving north can help the player explore the environment and find a water source.
3. Priority 3: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent) - If west and north are not suitable directions,
explore the environment by moving south to find water.
4. Priority 4: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent) - Returning to the starting point and moving east
will further help the player explore the environment to find a water source.
5. Priority 5: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool) - Once the player finds a water source,
they should interact with it to collect a drink to replenish their thirst.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West - Yes, the requirement is met. The player is currently facing grass to the west, which is flat
ground.
2. Priority 2: Move North - Yes, the requirement is met. There is flat ground above the agent as no obstacle is mentioned in
the north direction.
3. Priority 3: Move South - Yes, the requirement is met. There is flat ground below the agent since no obstacle is mentioned
in the south direction.
4. Priority 4: Move East - Yes, the requirement is met. The player has just moved from east to west, so there must be flat
ground to the east.
5. Priority 5: Do - No, the requirement is not met. The player has not discovered a water source to face and interact with
yet.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_east) succeeded because there was flat ground to the east, which allowed the player to
move in that direction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from above is Priority 1: Move West. The requirement is met, as there is flat ground to the agent’
s left (west), and it will help the player explore the environment in search of a water source.

1. Priority 1: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent)
- Move in the east direction to get closer to the path and table.
2. Priority 2: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above of the agent)
- Move in the north direction searching for a water source to restore thirst and also to get closer to the tree for
collecting wood if needed.
3. Priority 3: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent)
- Move in the west direction to explore the environment and potentially find a water source.
4. Priority 4: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent)
- Move in the south direction to explore the environment and potentially find a water source.
5. Priority 5: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have a necessary tool)
- Interact with the water source if found while exploring, using the necessary tool (if any) to drink and restore thirst.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move East: Yes, the requirement for moving east (flat ground right to the agent) is met, as the player can see a path 2
steps to their north-east.
2. Move North: Yes, the requirement for moving north (flat ground above the agent) is met, as the player sees grass at their
front (west), suggesting flat ground is available for movement in all cardinal directions.
3. Move West: Yes, the requirement for moving west (flat ground left to the agent) is met, as seen in Player Observation
Step 194, where the agent took action move_west.
4. Move South: Yes, the requirement for moving south (flat ground below the agent) is met, as the player sees grass at their
front (west), suggesting flat ground is available for movement in all cardinal directions.
5. Do: Currently, the requirement for "Do" action (facing creature or material; have necessary tool) is not met, as the
player is only facing grass, and there is no mention of a nearby water source or the tool needed to interact with it.
The player will need to move and explore to find the water source before this requirement is met.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action "move_west" succeeded. The player was able to move in the west direction since there was flat
ground (grass) in front of them, allowing them to change their position.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is "Move East" as it will bring the player closer to the path and the table,
and it meets the requirement of having flat ground to the right of the agent.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 4/5: Collect more resources. Since your inventory is relatively low on some resources, consider collecting more
stones, wood, and iron. This will be helpful for crafting additional tools or weapons in the future.
2. Priority 5/5: Drink water to replenish your thirst. Your drink level is currently 5/9, so finding water in a nearby lake
or a water source to drink should be a priority to prevent dehydration.
3. Priority 3/5: Craft better tools or weapons. If you collect enough resources, especially iron, you might want to craft an
iron pickaxe and an iron sword for better efficiency and combat. For this, you will need more iron and a furnace to
smelt it.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
For the top sub-task (Collect more resources):
Requirements:
1. Locate nearby resources such as stones, wood, or iron deposits.
2. Ensure you have the correct tools to collect the resources (wood_pickaxe for stone, stone_pickaxe for iron).
3. Inventory space to hold the collected resources.
What should the player do first:
Find and approach nearby resource deposits, such as stones or wood from a tree. If you locate iron deposits, use your
stone_pickaxe to collect it. If it’s stone you’re after, use your wood_pickaxe for efficient collection. Make sure to
keep an eye on your inventory to ensure you have space for the collected resources.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 4/5: Collect more iron with the stone_pickaxe for crafting iron tools and weapons. Look for iron ore and
continue collecting to strengthen your equipment.
2. Priority 5/5: Find a water source to drink, as your current drink level is 5/9. Drinking from a lake, river, or another
water source will help restore your thirst level.
3. Priority 3/5: Chase and defeat/eat the cow 6 steps to your north-west to restore your health and food levels, as your
current food level is 6/9. This will help maintain your character’s overall health status.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (Collect more iron):
1. Find an iron ore vein.
2. Use the stone_pickaxe in the inventory to collect the iron ore.
The player should first move towards the stone that is 3 steps to the south-east, as there is a chance it could be an iron
ore vein. Once the player reaches the stone, they should use the stone_pickaxe to collect the iron ore if it is indeed
an iron vein.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent)
2. Priority 2 - Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent)
3. Priority 3 - Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent)
4. Priority 4 - Do (Requirement: Facing iron or stone; have stone_pickaxe in inventory)
5. Priority 5 - Move North to find a water source for drinking (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move South: Yes, the requirement (flat ground below the agent) is met as the player just moved south and
there is no indication of obstacles below them.
2. Priority 2 - Move East: Yes, the requirement (flat ground right to the agent) is met as there is no mention of obstacles
to the player’s right (east).
3. Priority 3 - Move East: Yes, the requirement (flat ground right to the agent) is met as there is no mention of obstacles
to the east. However, after performing the second priority action (Move East), observe the surroundings to ensure that
the path remains clear.
4. Priority 4 - Do: The requirement (facing iron or stone; have stone_pickaxe in inventory) is partially met. The player has
a stone_pickaxe in their inventory, but they need to face iron or stone. After performing the previous actions (Move
South and Move East), they will likely be facing the stone they saw at step 200.
5. Priority 5 - Move North to find a water source for drinking: The requirement (flat ground above the agent) is met at the
current position, but the visibility of a water source is unknown. The player will need to move north and observe
their surroundings to locate a water source.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action "move_south" succeeded because there was flat ground to the south of the player, allowing them
to move in that direction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list is Priority 1 - Move South, as its requirement (flat ground below the agent) is met,
and it helps the player progress towards the stone they previously saw.

Since the player’s inventory is relatively low on stone and iron, it would be beneficial to collect more resources.
2. Restore food and drink levels (Priority: 5/5):
The player’s food and drink levels are 6/9 and 5/9, respectively. Restoring these levels should be a priority to maintain
health and survival.
3. Craft better tools and weapons (Priority: 3/5):
The player has a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe. Crafting better tools, such as an iron_pickaxe, and better weapons can
improve their ability to collect resources and defend themselves against potential threats. However, this depends
on the availability of required resources.

Top Sub-Task: Collect more resources
Requirements:
1. Locate and approach resource nodes (stone, iron, coal), while being mindful of any potential threats (monsters, falling
hazards).
2. Use the appropriate tool (wood_pickaxe for stone and coal, stone_pickaxe for iron) for efficient and effective resource
collection.
3. Monitor inventory space to avoid overfilling and being unable to carry additional resources.
First action:
The player should navigate to the stone they see 3 steps to their south-east and use their stone_pickaxe to collect it.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move South-East (Action 3) - Requirements: Flat ground diagonal to the agent.
Rationale: The stone resource is 3 steps to the south-east, and moving in that direction will get the player closer.
2. Priority 2: Move South (Action 4) - Requirements: Flat ground below the agent.
Rationale: After moving south-east, the stone should be closer to the south. Moving south will directly bring the player
to the stone resource.
3. Priority 3: Do (Action 5) - Requirements: Facing the stone resource (3 steps south-east); have the stone_pickaxe (already
in the inventory).
Rationale: To collect the stone resource, the player needs to face the stone and use the stone_pickaxe to mine it.
4. Priority 4: Move North-East (Action 2) - Requirements: Flat ground diagonal to the agent.
Rationale: After collecting the stone, the player should navigate back to the table seen 2 steps south-east, and north-
east will be the best way to return.
5. Priority 5: Place Furnace (Action 9) - Requirements: Stone in inventory (will be collected after mining the stone).
Rationale: With the gathered stone, the player will be able to place a furnace near the table, allowing smelting and
crafting of iron tools and weapons.

1. Priority 1: Move South-East (Action 3) - Requirements: Flat ground diagonal to the agent.
Yes, the requirements are met. The player can move south-east to get closer to the stone.
2. Priority 2: Move South (Action 4) - Requirements: Flat ground below the agent.
No, the requirements are currently not met. After moving south-east, the player might have the flat ground below them, and
then they can move south.
3. Priority 3: Do (Action 5) - Requirements: Facing the stone resource (3 steps south-east); have the stone_pickaxe (already
in the inventory).
No, the requirements are currently not met. The player needs to be near and facing the stone resource first, which will be
possible after moving south-east and then south.
4. Priority 4: Move North-East (Action 2) - Requirements: Flat ground diagonal to the agent.
No, the requirements are currently not met. The player first has to move south-east, south, and mine the stone before they
can move northeast towards the table.
5. Priority 5: Place Furnace (Action 9) - Requirements: Stone in inventory (will be collected after mining the stone).
No, the requirements are currently not met. The player needs to successfully mine the stone, and then they can place the
furnace near the table.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_west) succeeded. The player was able to move west because there was flat ground (grass) in
front of the player, allowing them to move in that direction.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (Find a water source to drink from):
1. Locate a water source, such as a lake or river, while exploring the game world.
2. Approach the water source and face the water directly.
The player should first prioritize locating a water source. They can do this by exploring the game world, moving in various
directions (north, east, south, or west) while keeping an eye on any visible lakes, rivers, or other bodies of water
in the environment. Once they find a water source, they should approach it and take a drink to replenish their thirst.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move East: Requirements - Flat ground right to the agent. This action will bring the player closer to the
table and stone observed in their current position.
2. Priority 2 - Move South: Requirements - Flat ground below the agent. Moving south will also bring the player closer to
the stone and the table.
3. Priority 3 - Make Iron Pickaxe: Requirements - Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, iron in inventory. Assuming the player
has access to a furnace, this action will allow them to upgrade their pickaxe.
4. Priority 4 - Move North: Requirements - Flat ground above the agent. Exploring the area might help the player find a
water source or other helpful resources.
5. Priority 5 - Move West: Requirements - Flat ground left to the agent. This action allows the player to explore and
possibly find new resources or water sources. The player should also be prepared to change direction if an obstacle is
encountered.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move East: Yes, the requirements are met. Flat ground is right to the player.
2. Move South: Yes, the requirements are met. Flat ground is below the player.
3. Make Iron Pickaxe: Partially met. The player has wood, coal, and iron in their inventory. However, it’s unclear whether
the player currently has access to a furnace. The player has to be nearby the table and the furnace to craft the iron
pickaxe.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Craft an iron_pickaxe and iron_sword (Priority: 5/5)
To achieve these goals, you would need more iron and to place a furnace. Once the furnace is placed, use the coal in the
inventory for smelting additional iron.
2. Increase food and drink levels (Priority: 4/5)
Find sources of food (e.g., cows, fruits) and water (e.g., lakes, rivers). Interact with them to consume food and drink in
order to restore your food and drink levels.
3. Collect more resources (Priority: 3/5)
Gather more wood, stone, and other essential resources to ensure you have enough materials for future crafting, building,
and surviving potential threats.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
To complete the top sub-task of crafting an iron_pickaxe and iron_sword, the player needs to meet the following requirements:
1. Collect more iron: The player currently has 1 iron in their inventory. Crafting an iron_pickaxe and iron_sword requires a
total of 5 iron (3 for the pickaxe, 2 for the sword). To collect more iron, the player should use their stone_pickaxe
to mine iron ores.
2. Place a furnace: The player needs a furnace to smelt the iron ores. The player has enough stone in their inventory (1) to
craft a furnace. The player should place their furnace in a nearby suitable location.
3. Smelt iron ores into iron ingots: Once the furnace is placed, the player can use the coal (2) in their inventory to smelt
the iron ores into iron ingots.
4. Craft iron_pickaxe and iron_sword: With sufficient iron ingots and a placed furnace, the player can then use the nearby
table to craft the iron_pickaxe and iron_sword.
The first thing the player should do is place the furnace in a suitable location, as they already have enough stone in their
inventory to craft it. Then, they can proceed with collecting more iron using their stone_pickaxe.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Place Furnace (Requirement: Stone in inventory)
The player has enough stone in their inventory to craft a furnace, which is needed for smelting iron ores later.
2. Priority 2: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent)
The player should start exploring their surroundings to locate iron ores which are necessary for crafting an iron_pickaxe
and iron_sword.
3. Priority 3: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent)
Continuing exploration in search of iron ores, the player should move in different directions.
4. Priority 4: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool)
Once the player locates iron ores, they should use their stone_pickaxe to mine them for collecting more iron.
5. Priority 5: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)
As part of exploring the surroundings and possibly finding more resources, the player can move in this direction as well.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Place Furnace: Yes, the requirement is met. The player has 1 stone in their inventory, which is enough to place a furnace.
2. Move East: Yes, the requirement is met. The player faces a path (flat ground) to their east.
3. Move South: No, the requirement is not met at this moment due to the player facing a table. The player needs to face flat
ground to the south to move in that direction.
4. Do: No, the requirement is not met. The player has not found any iron ores and is not facing any creature or material to
interact with.
5. Move North: Yes, the requirement is met. The player has a path (flat ground) 1 step to their north, which makes it
possible to move in that direction.

This will allow you to craft an iron pickaxe and iron sword, which will help you gather resources faster and be better
prepared for combat.
3. Collecting Wood (Priority: 3/5) - You’ll need more wood resources for crafting additional items, fueling the furnace, and
building other structures. Find a nearby tree and gather wood. Although it’s not necessary, crafting an axe will make
wood collection faster.
While not in the top 3, consider increasing your food and drink levels in the near future to avoid negative effects on your
health and energy.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
For the top sub-task (Crafting and placing a Furnace):
Requirements:
- Have enough stone in the inventory (at least 8)
- Be near a placed table
Since you already have 1 stone in your inventory, the first thing the player should do is:
1. Collect 7 more stones using the stone_pickaxe. Find and move towards stone blocks in your surroundings to mine them with
your pickaxe.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
Priority 1: Move East - Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent.
Reason: Move back towards the stone block to mine more stone.
Priority 2: Do (Mine Stone) - Requirement: Facing stone and have a necessary tool (stone_pickaxe).
Reason: Mine the stone block to collect more stone and reach the required amount for crafting a furnace.
Priority 3: Move North (Optional) - Requirement: Flat ground above the agent.
Reason: This action helps explore new locations in case the current surroundings do not have enough stone blocks.
Priority 4: Move West (Optional) - Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent.
Reason: This action is also helpful for exploring new locations if not enough stone blocks are found nearby.
Priority 5: Make Furnace - Requirement: Nearby table; having at least 8 stone in the inventory.
Reason: Once you have collected enough stone, craft a furnace by standing near the table and utilizing the acquired
resources.
Please note that the priority 3 and 4 actions are optional, as they depend on whether there are enough stone blocks in the
immediate surroundings to collect the required materials for the furnace.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
Priority 1: Move East - Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent.
- Yes, the requirement is met as the player had just moved west from a flat ground.
Priority 2: Do (Mine Stone) - Requirement: Facing stone and have a necessary tool (stone_pickaxe).
- In the Player Observation Step 220, the player faces grass. So, the player must first move east (Priority 1) to face the
stone block. The player has a stone_pickaxe in their inventory, so they have the necessary tool.
Priority 3: Move North (Optional) - Requirement: Flat ground above the agent.
- Yes, the requirement is met as there is a path 1 step to the north.
Priority 4: Move West (Optional) - Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent.
- Yes, the requirement is met since grass is mentioned in Player Observation Step 220 when the player moved west.
171

--- PAGE 172 ---
Priority 5: Make Furnace - Requirement: Nearby table; having at least 8 stone in the inventory.
- The player is currently near a table, but they only have 1 stone in their inventory. The requirement is not met yet. The
player needs to perform Priority 2 action (Do - Mine Stone) until they have enough stone.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_west) succeeded. It succeeded because the player was able to move to a location with flat
ground (grass) to their west without any obstacles or restrictions.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:

the inventory. So, yes the requirements are met.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Mine Stone (Priority: 5/5): The player is facing a stone, and since they have a stone_pickaxe in their inventory, they
should mine the stone to collect more stone resources.
2. Collect Wood (Priority: 4/5): The player needs wood to be able to craft items at the table. They should move towards the
tree and chop it down using their wood_pickaxe or stone_pickaxe to collect wood.
3. Restore Food and Drink (Priority: 3/5): The player’s food is at 6/9, and drink is at 5/9. They should hunt for food
sources, such as cows or fruit, and find a water source, like a lake or river, to increase their food and drink levels.

2. Have a pickaxe in inventory: The player has both wood_pickaxe and stone_pickaxe in their inventory.
What should the player do first:
The player should use their stone_pickaxe to mine the stone they are facing. Thus, the first step is to take action ’do’
with their stone_pickaxe to mine and collect the stone.

stone.
2. Priority 2: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool)

be met since the agent has a stone_pickaxe in the inventory.
3. Priority 3: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent)
- Yes, the requirement is met. There is a flat ground to the west of the agent, and moving west will bring the agent closer
to the table.
4. Priority 4: Move toward a water source (Requirement: Flat ground in the direction of the water source)
- We cannot determine if the requirement is met, as the current observation does not mention a nearby water source. Further
exploration is needed to find a water source and check if there is flat ground leading towards it.
5. Priority 5: Collect Drink (Requirement: At a water source)
- No, the requirement is not met. The agent needs to find a water source and move to its location before being able to
collect a drink.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?

The last action taken by the player was move_south.
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
- Grass: No requirements for interaction, so the requirements are met.
- Stone: Requires a wood or stone pickaxe to mine. You have both a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in your inventory; thus,
the requirements are met.
- Path: No requirements for interaction, so the requirements are met.
- Tree: Requires a wood or stone axe (not mentioned in previous instructions) to chop. Currently, you don’t have an axe in
your inventory; thus, the requirements are not met.
- Table: No requirements for interaction, so the requirements are met.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 4/5: Collect more resources - Mine the stone to increase your stone resources. You already have a wood_pickaxe
and a stone_pickaxe, which meet the requirement for mining stone.
2. Priority 5/5: Replenish food and drink - Your food and drink levels are 5/9 and 4/9, respectively. Find a source of food
and drink, like a cow or a lake, to maintain a healthy state.
3. Priority 3/5: Craft additional tools and weapons - Use the table in proximity to craft more tools or weapons (e.g., an
iron pickaxe or iron sword), which can help you acquire more valuable resources and defend against threats. You might
need to collect more iron and wood for crafting.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
For the top sub-task, "Collect more resources," the requirements are:
1. Having an appropriate tool to mine the stone: Since the player already has a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in their
inventory, this requirement is met.
The player should first use either their wood_pickaxe or stone_pickaxe to mine the stone by facing the stone and taking the
action "Do." This action will help increase the player’s stone resources, which can later be used for crafting items
or building structures.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Do (Mine the stone) - Requirement: Facing the stone and having the necessary tool (wood_pickaxe or
stone_pickaxe) in the inventory.
2. Priority 2: Move West (Towards the table) - Requirement: Flat ground to the west of the agent.

4. Priority 4: Move North (Explore the area) - Requirement: Flat ground above the agent.
5. Priority 5: Move South (Explore the area) - Requirement: Flat ground below the agent.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Do (Mine the stone) - Yes, requirements are met as the player is facing the stone and has a stone_pickaxe in their
inventory.
2. Move West (Towards the table) - Yes, requirements are met as there is a flat ground (path) to the west of the agent.
3. Make Iron Pickaxe - No, requirements are not met since the player is not near a table or a furnace.
4. Move North (Explore the area) - No, requirements are not met as the player is facing the stone at their front (south).
5. Move South (Explore the area) - Yes, requirements are met as there is a flat ground (stone) below the agent.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action to move_south succeeded because there was flat ground in the south direction, allowing the
player to move there.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (Increase food and drink levels):
181

--- PAGE 182 ---
1. Locate a source of food: Look for cows, plants, or fruit that can be collected and consumed to restore your food levels.
2. Locate a source of water: Find a lake or river where you can drink water to restore your drink levels.
What should the player do first:
Since both food and drink levels are essential for maintaining good health and energy, the player should start by locating a
nearby source of food or water. If the player sees a cow, plant, or fruit in their vicinity, they should prioritize
moving towards it to collect food. If there’s a lake or river nearby, the player should move towards it to drink water.
If multiple sources are available, the player can choose based on proximity and the ease of reaching them.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - Moving west will bring the player closer to the
grass, which may provide food (plants or fruit) to restore their food levels.
2. Priority 2: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have the necessary tool) - If the player encounters a cow or
another source of food, they can perform ’Do’ to collect food.
3. Priority 3: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent) - Moving south will bring the player closer to the tree,
which may also provide food (fruit) or wood for crafting purposes.
4. Priority 4: Drink (Requirement: Facing a water source, such as a lake or river) - If the player comes across a water
source, they should drink from it to restore their drink levels.
5. Priority 5: Sleep (Requirement: Energy level is below maximum) - While the current energy level is at maximum, it’s
essential to remember to sleep when the energy level decreases, ensuring good health and productivity.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move West: Yes, the requirement for flat ground to the left of the agent is met since there’s a path 1 step to the west.
2. Do: Currently, the player is not facing any creature or material like a cow or plant required for this action, so the
requirement is not met.
3. Move South: Yes, the requirement for flat ground below the agent is met since there’s a path to the south of the player.
4. Drink: The player’s observation does not mention any water sources in sight, so the requirement for the ’Drink’ action is
not met.
5. Sleep: No, the requirement is not met since the player’s energy level is currently at the maximum (9/9).
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action succeeded. The player was facing a stone at their front (south) and used the "do" action, which
resulted in successfully collecting the stone. This can be confirmed by the increase in the stone count in the
inventory from 3 to 4.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.

3. Priority 3/5: Collect more resources such as wood, stone, and iron to expand your inventory, improve your tools, and gain
the ability to craft more advanced items. Be cautious of your energy levels and prioritize rest if needed.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Top sub-task requirements: Replenish your drink and food levels.
1. Find a water source: Explore the surrounding area to locate a lake, river or another source of water. When you’re near a
water source, interact with it (use the action "Collect Drink") to restore your drink level.
2. Find food resources: Look for fruit-bearing plants, or hunt animals like cows which can be eaten when defeated. When you
have food items in your inventory, use the actions "Place Plant" and "Eat Plant," or "Eat Cow" to restore your food
level.
First steps: Start by looking for a water source in your vicinity (move in any of the four directions). As you explore, keep
an eye out for food resources. Once you locate a water source, interact with it to collect drink and restore your
thirst level. Many of the actions that involve movement and exploration can be carried out simultaneously, so
exploring the surroundings should be the first priority.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

will help you explore the surrounding area and locate a water source and food resources.
2. Priority 2: Collect Drink - Requirement: A water source like a lake or river nearby. Quench your thirst by interacting
with the water source to increase your drink level.
3. Priority 3: Collect Sampling or Defeat Cow - Requirement: Finding fruit-bearing plants or encountering cows. Collect
saplings from plants or defeat cows to obtain food resources.
4. Priority 4: Place Plant or Eat Cow - Requirement: Sapling or cow meat in the inventory. Use the obtained food resources
from the previous action to replenish your food level.
5. Priority 5: Eat Plant - Requirement: Placed plant in your vicinity. Consume the growing fruits to further satisfy your
food needs and ensure your survival in the game.

The player can move West to grass, North to a path, or East from their current position.
2. Collect Drink: No, the current observation does not mention any water sources like lakes or rivers nearby. The player may
need to explore more to find a water source.
3. Collect Sampling or Defeat Cow: No, the current observation does not mention fruit-bearing plants or cows nearby. The
player may need to explore more to find food resources.
4. Place Plant or Eat Cow: No. The player does not have any saplings or cow meat in their inventory.
5. Eat Plant: No, the current observation does not mention any placed plants in the vicinity for the player to consume
fruits.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 5/5: Increase your food and drink levels - You have low food (5/9) and drink (4/9) levels. You can kill the cow
(7 steps to your north-west) for food and find a source of water to restore your drink levels.
195

--- PAGE 196 ---
2. Priority 4/5: Craft an iron sword and iron pickaxe - You have iron in your inventory, but it needs to be smelted using a
furnace and coal. If you don’t already have a furnace, craft one using stone in your inventory. After smelting the
iron, craft an iron sword and iron pickaxe using the smelted iron, as they will be more effective for combat and
mining.
3. Priority 3/5: Collect more resources - Mine the facing stone for additional building materials and find more coal and
iron to create more advanced tools, weapons, and armor. Keep exploring your surroundings for valuable resources such
as diamonds using your stone_pickaxe.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The requirements for the top sub-task (Increasing your food and drink levels) are:
1. Killing the cow for food: You need to have a weapon, such as a wood, stone, or iron sword, to kill the cow effectively.
In your inventory, you already have a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe, which can be used as makeshift weapons to kill
the cow.
2. Finding a source of water to drink: You need to find a drinkable water source, such as a lake or river, and drink from it
to restore your drink level.
What the player should do first:
1. Approach the cow: Move towards the cow (7 steps to your north-west) to get in a closer range for attacking.
2. Kill the cow: Use your wood_pickaxe, stone_pickaxe, or (if available) a sword to kill the cow and collect the meat.
3. Find a water source: Explore the environment to locate a lake or river.
4. Drink water: Approach the water source and drink from it to restore your drink level.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Move towards the cow and water source)
Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent.
2. Priority 2: Move North (Continue moving towards the cow and possibly the water source)
Requirement: Flat ground above the agent.
3. Priority 3: Do (Kill the cow and collect meat)
Requirement: Facing the cow and having a necessary tool in inventory (wood_pickaxe or stone_pickaxe).
4. Priority 4: Move West/North/East/South (Find a water source by exploring the environment)
Requirement: Flat ground in the direction the agent wants to move.
5. Priority 5: Collect Drink (Drink water to restore the drink level)
Requirement: Facing a drinkable water source like a lake or river.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West
Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent.
Yes, the requirements are met. There is a path 1 step to the west.
2. Priority 2: Move North
Requirement: Flat ground above the agent.
Yes, the requirements are met. The agent moved north in the previous step, and the ground seems to be flat.
3. Priority 3: Do (Kill the cow and collect meat)
Requirement: Facing the cow and having a necessary tool in inventory (wood_pickaxe or stone_pickaxe).
Not yet. The agent is currently facing stone and 7 steps away from the cow. The wood_pickaxe or stone_pickaxe can be used
for this action when the agent is closer and facing the cow.
4. Priority 4: Move West/North/East/South (Find a water source by exploring the environment)
Requirement: Flat ground in the direction the agent wants to move.
Yes, the requirements are met for moving west and north. Flat ground is located in both directions. Moving east and south
are not ideal as they move the agent away from the cow and potential water source.
5. Priority 5: Collect Drink (Drink water to restore the drink level)
Requirement: Facing a drinkable water source like a lake or river.
No, the agent hasn’t found a drinkable water source yet. The agent needs to explore the world to discover a water source
first.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_north) succeeded because there was flat ground available to the north, allowing the player
to move in that direction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 4/5: Craft a weapon (wood_sword or stone_sword)
Since you have the necessary materials (wood and stone) in your inventory, crafting a weapon will help you efficiently
interact with the cow to collect meat for restoring food points.
2. Priority 3/5: Collect more wood from the tree
You have only 1 unit of wood in your inventory, and considering the importance of wood as a basic crafting material,
collecting more wood from the nearby tree should be a priority.
3. Priority 5/5: Find and drink water to restore drink points
Your drink points are at 4/9, indicating that you need to find a water source (like a lake or river) and drink from it to
maintain your hydration levels. Prioritize this task to avoid negative effects from dehydration.

Answer:
For the top sub-task (crafting a weapon - wood_sword or stone_sword), the requirements are:
1. A nearby crafting table
2. Adequate resources in the inventory (wood and stone)
Since you currently have wood and stone in your inventory, you need to place a crafting table first. To do this, complete
the following steps:
1. Craft a table using your wood: make sure you have at least 2 units of wood in your inventory (currently, you have only 1
unit).
2. Place a table: After crafting the table, find a suitable location and place the table.
Once you have placed the table, interact with it to craft a wooden sword or a stone sword to complete the top sub-task.
Remember that you need more wood for crafting the table, so focus on collecting wood from the nearby tree before
placing the table.

5. Priority 5 - Move North or North-West: Requirement - Flat ground above or above-left of the agent. (To approach the cow
for a possible food source)
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move West: Yes, the requirement of flat ground is met, as you are facing grass in front of you (west).
2. Do: Yes, the requirement is met because you have a necessary tool (wood_pickaxe) in your inventory and are facing a tree
(material).
3. Place Table: Yes, the requirement is met because you have wood in your inventory.
4. Make Wood Sword or Make Stone Sword: Partially met, as you have wood and stone in your inventory. The requirement for the
nearby table is not met yet since you still need to place the crafting table (action 3).
5. Move North or North-West: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground above you (north), and the cow is 5 steps
to your north-west, which also implies flat ground.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?

Answer:
The requirements for the top sub-task (Craft a weapon to kill the cow for food) are:
1. Have enough wood or stone in the inventory.
2. Place a table (if not already placed) to use for crafting.
The player currently has 1 wood and 4 stone in their inventory, which is enough to craft either a wood or stone sword. Since
the player has enough materials, they should first ensure that a crafting table is placed. If there is no existing
table in the vicinity, the player should place one using the wood in their inventory. After that, the player can
proceed to craft either a wood or stone sword using the placed table.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

2) Make a wood sword to kill the cow using available wood in inventory
3) Alternatively, make a stone sword since a stone sword is stronger and the player has enough stone
4) Move north towards the cow to get closer for interaction
5) Move west towards the cow to reach it before the player’s food depletes
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Place Table - Yes, the requirement of having wood in the inventory is met (Player has 1 wood).
2. Make Wood Sword - No, the requirement of having a nearby table is not met since the player has not placed a table yet.
The wood requirement is met (Player has 1 wood).

Answer:
1. Collect more wood (Priority: 5/5) - Wood is essential for crafting more tools, and you only have one piece of wood in
your inventory. Collecting more wood would allow you to build more advanced tools like a sword for defense or an axe
for faster wood collection.

drink from it to restore your thirst level.
3. Defeat the cow for food (Priority: 3/5) - Your food level is at 5/9, which is not critical yet, but defeating the cow
would provide you with a food resource to restore your health later when needed. Use one of your pickaxes as a weapon
until you can craft a sword for more efficient combat.

Question: Action
Answer:
Make Stone Sword
Question: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its
requirement.
Answer:
1. Stone: The stone provides material for crafting tools, weapons, and furnaces. The requirement to collect stone is to have
a wood pickaxe.
2. Path: The path is not a resource provider, but it serves as a safe passage to navigate the game world without facing
resistance from the terrain.
3. Tree: The tree provides wood, which is needed for crafting tools, weapons, and furniture. No specific requirements are
needed to collect wood, but having an axe can speed up the process.
4. Cow: The cow provides food (meat) to restore the player’s food level. The requirement to collect food from the cow is to
have a weapon, like a wood or stone sword, to defeat it.
5. Grass: Grass does not provide any resources directly but can be a flat surface to move on or place items. No requirements
are needed to interact with grass.
Question: What was the last action taken by the player?
Answer:
The last action taken by the player was move_west.
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
207

--- PAGE 208 ---
1. Stone: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction, as the player has a wood_pickaxe in their inventory.
2. Path: As there are no requirements for interacting with the path, this can be considered as met.
3. Tree: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction. While there’s no specific requirement for collecting wood, having an
axe can speed up the process. However, even without an axe, the player can still collect wood.
4. Cow: The player does not have a sword (wood or stone) in their inventory, so the requirements for interaction with the
cow (to collect food) are not met.
5. Grass: As there are no requirements for interacting with grass, this can be considered as met.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Craft a weapon (Priority: 5/5): Crafting either a wood sword or a stone sword should be the player’s top priority as they
need a weapon to defend themselves and defeat cows to collect food.
2. Collect food (Priority: 4/5): The player has a low food level (5/9), so defeating a cow is crucial for obtaining food and
replenishing their food meter. This task will become possible once the player has crafted a weapon.
3. Collect drink (Priority: 3/5): The player’s drink level is at 4/9, so finding a water source, like a lake or river, will
help replenish their thirst. This task can be performed while focusing on crafting a weapon and collecting food.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
For the top sub-task (Crafting a weapon), the requirements are:
1. Crafting a Wood Sword:
- Requires a nearby placed table
- Wood in inventory (which the player already has: 1 wood)
2. Crafting a Stone Sword:
- Requires a nearby placed table
- Wood and stone in inventory (which the player already has: 1 wood and 4 stone)
The player already placed a table in Step 266, and they have the necessary materials in their inventory. Therefore, the
player should craft a weapon (either a wood or stone sword) first using the placed table. Crafting a stone sword would
be more effective, as it is a stronger weapon compared to the wood sword.

Question: Action
Answer:
Move West
Question: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its
requirement.
Answer:
1. Path: Provides a way to navigate the terrain with ease. No requirement.
2. Tree: Provides wood when chopped. Requires a wood or better pickaxe to chop.
3. Cow: Provides food when killed. Requires a weapon (e.g., wood/stone/iron sword) to kill.
4. Grass: Provides no resources. No requirement. This is what the player currently faces.
Note: The player’s inventory and status are not objects in the observation, but provide information about the player’s
resources and health.
Question: What was the last action taken by the player?
Answer:
The last action taken by the player was "make_stone_sword."
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
1. Path: No requirement to interact. The path is 5 steps to your south-east, so the player can move towards it.
2. Tree: Requires a wood or better pickaxe to chop. The player has both a wood_pickaxe and stone_pickaxe in their inventory,
so the requirements are met.
3. Cow: Requires a weapon to kill. Although the player just made a stone sword in the previous step, the current observation
does not show the stone sword in the player’s inventory. This observation might be outdated or there might be an
error in the game state. Based on this observation, the requirements are not met.
4. Grass: No resource provided and no requirement for interaction. The player can move forward (west) without any issue.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 4/5: Find a source of water to drink. The player’s thirst level is only 4/9, so finding water would be crucial
to replenish their thirst.
2. Priority 3/5: Chopping the tree to collect more wood. The player only has 1 wood in their inventory, and having more wood
would be helpful for future crafting and building activities.
3. Priority 5/5: Check the player’s inventory for the recently crafted stone sword. If the sword is missing, try crafting
another stone sword to be equipped for any combat situations that might arise, such as defending against monsters or
killing the cow for food. The player’s food level is 5/9, so hunting the cow could help to replenish this resource.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
For the top sub-task of finding a source of water to drink:
Requirements:
1. Locate a body of water such as a lake, river, or pond.
2. Have an empty container to collect the water or be close enough to drink directly from the source.
The player should first explore their surroundings to locate a body of water nearby. They can move in any direction (north,
south, east, or west) to find a water source. Once they find a water source, they should interact with it to drink and
replenish their thirst level. If they have an empty container, they can use it to collect and store water for later
consumption.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move North, East, South, or West (depending on the direction of the water source) - Requirement: Flat ground
in the chosen direction.
2. Priority 2: Drink water (Do) - Requirement: Facing a water source (lake, river, or pond); close enough to interact.
3. Priority 3: Move North, East, South, or West (to approach a tree for collecting wood) - Requirement: Flat ground in the
chosen direction.

4. Priority 4: Collect Wood (Do) - Requirement: Facing a tree; have the necessary tool (wood_pickaxe) in the inventory.
5. Priority 5: Craft a Wood Sword (make_wood_sword) - Requirement: Nearby table; wood in the inventory.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move North, East, South, or West (to find a water source) - Yes, the requirement of flat ground in the chosen
direction is met. However, the player needs to discover a water source first.
2. Priority 2: Drink water (Do) - No, the requirement of facing a water source is not met. The player needs to find a water
source before they can drink.
3. Priority 3: Move North, East, South, or West (to approach a tree for collecting wood) - Yes, the requirement of flat
ground in the chosen direction is met. The tree is 2 steps to the west.
4. Priority 4: Collect Wood (Do) - No, the player is not currently facing a tree. They must move closer to the tree and face
it to meet the requirement.
5. Priority 5: Craft a Wood Sword (make_wood_sword) - No, the requirement of having a nearby table is not met. The player
needs to place a table first to craft a wood sword.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
It is unclear whether the last player action "make_stone_sword" succeeded, as there is no indication of success or failure
in the provided observations. However, the player’s inventory does not show a stone sword, which suggests that the
action might not have succeeded.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 3: Move West (to approach a tree for collecting wood), as it
satisfies the requirement of flat ground in the chosen direction and helps the player get closer to a valuable
resource.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Increase food level (Priority: 5/5): Since the food level is 5/9, it is important to find and kill a cow or develop
another food source to restore the food level.
2. Increase drink level (Priority: 4/5): The drink level is 3/9, which is low, and the player should look for a water source
like a lake or river to drink from and restore the drink level.
3. Craft a sword (Priority: 3/5): Crafting a wood, stone, or iron sword is necessary to defend against monsters and kill the
cow for food. The player has enough resources in their inventory to craft a sword at a table.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The top sub-task is to increase the food level. The requirements for this task are:
1. Locate a food source, such as a cow or a fruit, to kill or harvest.
2. Have a weapon (wood, stone, or iron sword) to kill the cow.
The player should first craft a sword since they already have the necessary resources in their inventory. They will need to
find and place a table, and then craft the sword using the materials available. Once they have a sword, they can kill
the cow, which is 4 steps to their north-east, to obtain food and increase their food level.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Make Wood Sword (Priority 5): This action requires the player to be near a table and have wood in their inventory. The
player currently has 1 wood in their inventory, which is enough to make a wood sword. This action will provide the
player with a weapon to defend themselves and kill the cow for food.
2. Move North (Priority 4): This action requires a flat ground above of the agent. The player wants to get closer to the cow,
which is 4 steps to their north-east. Moving north will bring the player one step closer to the cow.
3. Move East (Priority 3): This action requires a flat ground to the right of the agent. After moving north, moving east
will bring the player even closer to the cow, which is their primary target for obtaining food.
4. Do (Priority 2): This action requires the player to face a creature (in this case, the cow) and have the necessary tool (
the wood sword they crafted). Once the player is close enough to the cow and facing it, they can perform the "Do"
action to kill the cow and collect food.
5. Sleep (Priority 1): This action requires the player’s energy level to be below maximum. After obtaining food from the cow,
the player may choose to sleep (when necessary) to restore energy and allow time for other resources (like trees,
fruits, etc.) to spawn. However, this should only be done when it is safe to do so (e.g., near a shelter or a
protected area).
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Make Wood Sword: Yes, the requirements are met. The player has 1 wood in their inventory, and they have previously built
a table (from previous observations).
2. Move North: Yes, the requirements are met. The flat ground above the agent (grass) is available for the player to move
north.
3. Move East: Yes, the requirements are met. After moving north, the flat ground would be available to the agent’s right for
them to move east.
4. Do: No, the requirements are not met yet. The player first needs to get closer to the cow (by performing the "Move North"
and "Move East" actions) and face the cow before they can perform the "Do" action using the wood sword.
5. Sleep: Yes, the requirements are met. The player’s energy level is currently 9/9, which is below the maximum. They can
sleep when it is deemed necessary and safe to do so. However, it is not currently an urgent action.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action "move_west" succeeded. The player was able to move west because there were no obstacles in the
way and the ground was flat.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.

Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Action: Move East
Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent
Yes, the requirement is met as there is no information indicating that the ground to the agent’s right is not flat.
2. Action: Move North
Requirement: Flat ground above the agent
Yes, the requirement is met as the agent can see grass one step to the north, indicating that the ground is flat.
3. Action: Move West
Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent
Yes, the requirement is met since the agent successfully took this action in the previous step (Step 272).
4. Action: Move South
Requirement: Flat ground below the agent
There is no information about the ground to the agent’s south in the player observations. Thus, it is not possible to
determine if the requirement is met.
5. Action: Do
Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool
The agent is currently facing a tree (material), but there is no information about whether the agent has the necessary
tool (wood_axe) in the inventory. Thus, it is not possible to determine if the requirement is met.

Answer:
It’s not clear if the last player action succeeded, as there is no mention of a wood sword in the inventory in the Player
Observation Step 274. Additionally, the observation numbers seem to skip from 272 to 274, so there might be missing
information.

5. Sapling (in inventory): There are no requirements to interact with the sapling in your inventory, so the requirements are
met.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Craft a wood or stone sword to defeat the cow for food. Priority: 5/5, as the player’s food level is low.
2. Find a source of water or a lake to collect drink and restore the player’s thirst. Priority: 4/5, as the player’s drink
level is also low.
3. Place the sapling to grow more trees to collect wood later. Priority: 3/5, as this would provide a steady supply of wood
but is not as urgent as food and drink.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (Craft a wood or stone sword to defeat the cow for food):
- Wood or stone in inventory (the player has both)
- A nearby table, which has not been placed yet
The player should first place the table. To do this, the player should perform the action "Place Table" since there is wood
in the inventory.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Place Table (Requirement: Wood in inventory)
2. Priority 2: Make Wood Sword (Requirement: Nearby table, wood in inventory) or Make Stone Sword (Requirement: Nearby table,
wood and stone in inventory)
3. Priority 3: Move South-East until the player is near the cow. (Requirement: Flat ground in the south-east direction)
4. Priority 4: Do (Use the crafted sword to defeat the cow for food) (Requirement: Facing the cow, have the sword equipped)
5. Priority 5: Collect Drink by drinking from a lake (Requirement: Near a water source)
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Place Table: Yes, the requirement is met. The player has 1 wood in their inventory.
2. Make Wood Sword or Make Stone Sword: Yes, the requirements are met for both. The player has 1 wood and 4 stones in their
inventory. However, after placing the table in action 1, the player will need to choose between making a Wood Sword or
a Stone Sword.
3. Move South-East until the player is near the cow: Yes, the requirement is met. The player can move on flat ground in the
south-east direction towards the cow.
4. Do (Use the crafted sword to defeat the cow for food): The requirement could be met if the player had a crafted sword.
Currently, the player will need to craft a sword in action 2 before taking this action.
5. Collect Drink by drinking from a lake: The requirement is partially unclear. The player needs to be near a water source,
which is not mentioned in the player’s observation. However, if the player finds a water source, they can meet this
requirement.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
The last player action "do" did succeed, as it resulted in the player obtaining a sapling, as indicated by the inventory
update in Player Observation Step 280. The player likely interacted with the grass in front of them to collect the
sapling.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Place Table, as the requirement (wood in inventory) is met,
and it is the first action to perform in the prescribed sequence.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Craft a weapon to defeat the cow and replenish food (Priority: 5/5): Having a weapon, such as a wood or stone sword,
increases your ability to protect yourself and gather food resources. Crafting a weapon should be a high priority.
2. Increase drink levels to avoid dehydration (Priority: 4/5): Your current drink level is 3/9, and seeking a water source
or collecting a drink item will help avoid negative effects from dehydration. This is an important task, but not as
urgent as having a weapon for defense and hunting.
3. Plant the sapling to grow a tree and ensure a steady supply of wood (Priority: 3/5): Planting the sapling will eventually
provide more wood resources for crafting and building. While it is beneficial in the long run, it is not an immediate
necessity like having a weapon and increasing your drink levels.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Top Sub-Task: Craft a weapon to defeat the cow and replenish food.
Requirements:

2. Have wood or stone in your inventory (you have 1 wood and 4 stones)
As the player already has a placed table and the necessary resources in their inventory, they can proceed to craft a weapon.
Since they have both wood and stone available, it’s recommended to craft a stone sword for better efficiency and
durability.

4. Cow: Yes, the requirements for interacting with a cow are met, as the player can use their wood_pickaxe or stone_pickaxe
as a makeshift weapon to kill the cow and collect meat.
5. Grass: Yes, there are no requirements for interacting with grass, as it does not provide any resources. The player can
simply move onto or over the grass.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 5: Collect food - Kill the cow and collect meat to increase the food level. This is a top priority as the player’
s food level is currently 4/9.
2. Priority 4: Collect wood - Chop down the tree using the wood_pickaxe to gather wood. Additional wood will allow the
player to craft more tools or build structures.
3. Priority 3: Collect drink - Find a water source (e.g., lake, river) to drink for restoring the drink level. Currently,
the drink level is 3/9, which will need to be replenished soon.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Top sub-task: Collect food - Kill the cow and collect meat to increase the food level.
Requirements: The player should have a weapon, preferably a sword (wood, stone, or iron) to kill the cow more efficiently.
However, a weapon is not strictly necessary, as the player can still attempt to kill the cow with tools like the
pickaxe or even without any equipment by using their hands.
What should the player do first: Since the cow is currently 3 steps to the east, the player should move eastward to approach
the cow. Once close enough, the player can try to attack and kill the cow using a sword, a tool, or their hands to
collect the meat.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 4/5: Drink water to restore thirst - With a thirst level of 3/9, the player should prioritize finding a water
source and drinking from it to stay hydrated.
2. Priority 4/5: Collect food and eat - The player’s food level is 4/9, which indicates that they should focus on finding a
stable food source. The cow nearby can be killed to provide meat for immediate consumption, and the sapling can be
planted to grow more trees, which could eventually provide fruits.
3. Priority 3/5: Collect more resources - As the player has only 1 wood, 2 coal, and 1 iron in their inventory, they should
continue collecting resources such as iron, stone, and wood for crafting items and expanding the shelter. Chopping
down trees and mining iron are potential sub-tasks to achieve this goal.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Top sub-task: Drink water to restore thirst.
Requirements:
1. Find a water source, such as a lake, river, or well.
2. Approach the water source (move towards it using move_north, move_south, move_east, or move_west based on its relative
location).
3. Drink water when standing next to the water source.
What should the player do first:
The player should first scout for a water source nearby. If no water source is immediately visible, they should explore the
surrounding areas by moving in different directions until they locate one. Once a water source is found, the player
should approach and drink from it to restore their thirst level.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
225

--- PAGE 226 ---
1. Priority 1: Move (move_north, move_south, move_east, or move_west) - Requirement: Flat ground in the respective direction.
This action is a priority as it would help the player explore the environment and locate resources, such as water
sources or trees.
2. Priority 2: Drink - Requirement: Standing next to a water source. Drinking is a priority as it will restore the player’s
thirst level, which is currently low (3/9).
3. Priority 3: Do (chop down a tree) - Requirement: Facing a tree; have the necessary tool (wood_pickaxe, which the player
has in their inventory). This action will help the player gather wood, an essential resource for crafting and building
shelter.
4. Priority 4: Sleep - Requirement: Energy level is below maximum. Sleeping will restore the player’s energy, although the
energy level is still high (8/9) so it could be done later.
5. Priority 5: Make Wood Sword - Requirement: Nearby table; wood in inventory. Crafting a wood sword is important for self-
defense against potential threats like zombies and skeletons, but it’s a slightly lower priority than finding water
and collecting wood as the player’s health level is currently full (9/9).
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move (move_north, move_south, move_east, or move_west): Yes, the requirements are met. The player can choose a direction
with flat ground (such as move_north towards the grass) to explore the environment.
2. Drink: No, the requirements are not met. The player needs to be standing next to a water source to drink, which is not
the case in the current observation.
3. Do (chop down a tree): Yes, the requirements are met. The player is facing a tree in the west direction and has a
wood_pickaxe in their inventory.
4. Sleep: No, the requirement is not met. Although the player’s energy level is below maximum, it is still quite high (8/9),
so sleeping would not provide much benefit at this time.
5. Make Wood Sword: Yes, the requirements are met. The player has wood in their inventory, but they will need to place a
table first (using wood from the inventory) before making the wood sword.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_east) succeeded. It succeeded because there was flat ground (grass) to the east of the
player, allowing them to move in that direction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is chopping down a tree. To do this, the player should take the "Do" action,
which has met requirements: The player is facing a tree and has a wood_pickaxe in their inventory. This action will
help gather more wood, an essential resource for crafting and building shelter.

--- PAGE 227 ---
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
1. Grass: No specific requirements for interaction, so it’s met.
2. Path: No specific requirements for accessing, so it’s met.
3. Tree: Requires a wood_pickaxe or better to collect wood; the player has a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in their
inventory, so the requirement is met.
4. Furnace: Already placed on the map, so no requirements needed for interaction; it’s met. To smelt resources with the
furnace, the player needs coal, which they already have, so that requirement is also met.
5. Cow: Requires any type of weapon (e.g., wood_sword, stone_sword) to effectively hunt; the player doesn’t have a sword in
their inventory, so the requirement is not met.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Craft a sword for hunting and self-defense (Priority: 5/5)
- Use the existing wood or stone to craft a wood_sword or a stone_sword at a nearby table to effectively hunt the cow and
protect yourself from monsters.
2. Hunt the cow and increase food supply (Priority: 4/5)
- Once a sword is crafted, hunt the cow to replenish your food and maintain your health.
3. Find a water source to drink and replenish thirst (Priority: 3/5)
- Your drink level is currently low, so finding a water source to drink from should be a priority to avoid dehydration.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The top sub-task is to craft a sword for hunting and self-defense. The requirements for it are:
1. Locate a nearby crafting table or place a table using your wood inventory.
2. If you have enough wood, create a wood_sword at the table.
3. If you have enough stone, create a stone_sword at the table, which is preferred due to its better durability and damage.
The player should first locate a nearby crafting table or place one using the available wood in their inventory. Then,
depending on the available resources (wood or stone) in the inventory, the player should craft either a wood_sword or
a stone_sword at the table.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move South (5 steps): Flat ground below the agent. This action will help the player reach the path for better
navigation.
2. Priority 2: Drink: Find a water source to drink from as the player’s current drink level is low (3/9).
3. Priority 3: Do: Facing cow at front (east); no tool required for hunting. This action will provide food to the player.
4. Priority 4: Place Furnace: Stone in inventory. The player will need a furnace to smelt iron later.
5. Priority 5: Make Iron Sword: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, iron in inventory. Crafting an iron sword will improve
the player’s defense and hunting capabilities.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move South (5 steps): Yes, the requirement of flat ground below the agent is met.
2. Priority 2: Drink: The requirement of finding a water source is not met in the current observations.
3. Priority 3: Do: Yes, the requirement of facing cow at front (east) is met, and no tool is required for hunting.
4. Priority 4: Place Furnace: Yes, the requirement of having stone in the inventory is met.
5. Priority 5: Make Iron Sword: No, the requirement of having a nearby table is not met in the current observations. Also,
the player has only 1 iron in their inventory which may not be enough to craft an iron sword.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
The last player action appears to have succeeded, as the player is now facing a cow at the front (east). This indicates that
the "do" action made the player interact with the cow, as intended.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from above is Priority 1: Move South (5 steps) since the requirement of flat ground below the
agent is met.

Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
246

--- PAGE 247 ---
It is unclear if the last player action "do" succeeded because there is no specified interaction or context provided. The
player is facing grass, and there are no indications of any changes to their surroundings or inventory after taking
the "do" action. It is possible that the "do" action did not perform anything relevant due to the lack of context or
interaction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is:
Priority 1: Move North/East/South/West (choose the direction that leads to a potential water source)
Requirement: Flat ground in the chosen direction
Since the player is currently facing flat ground (grass) to the west, this action can be executed. The player should choose
a direction that leads them towards a potential water source.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 4/5: Find and drink water - Your drink level is at 2/9, so finding a water source and drinking from it should be
a priority to avoid thirst.
2. Priority 3/5: Hunt the cow for food - Your food level is at 4/9, and hunting the nearby cow provides meat, which can be
used as food. This task is not as urgent as finding water, but it’s still essential to maintain your food level.
3. Priority 2/5: Collect more wood from the tree - You have only 1 wood in your inventory, and collecting more wood could be
helpful for crafting more tools, weapons, or building shelters. This task has a lower priority than finding water and
hunting the cow since it doesn’t directly affect your survival.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The top sub-task is finding and drinking water.
Requirements:
1. Locate a water source, such as a lake or river.
What should the player do first:
1. Explore the area and search for a water source. The player can move in different directions (west, east, north, and south
) to discover new terrains and find a water source. Once the water source is found, the player should approach it and
drink from it to restore their thirst level.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Requirement: If moving east doesn’t reveal a water source, change the direction to north and continue the search.
3. Priority 3 - Move West: Flat ground left to the agent.
Requirement: If moving north doesn’t reveal a water source, change the direction to west and continue the search.
4. Priority 4 - Move South: Flat ground below the agent.
Requirement: If moving west doesn’t reveal a water source, change the direction to south and continue the search.
5. Priority 5 - Drink: At the water source (lake or river).
Requirement: Successfully find a water source, approach it, and drink from it to restore the player’s thirst level.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move East: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (path) 2 steps to the east of the player.
2. Move North: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (grass) right in front of the player (north).
3. Move West: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (grass) 1 step to the west of the player.
4. Move South: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (grass) and a cow 2 steps to the south of the player.

2. Priority 2: Drink - No, the requirements are not met, as the player hasn’t found a water source yet.
3. Priority 3: Move (Direction: West, East, North, or South) - Yes, the requirements are met. The player can continue
exploring the environment and locate more resources such as wood or food, or find a shelter to recover energy.
4. Priority 4: Do (Collect wood, chase cow, or other action) - Partially met, the player has a wood_pickaxe and
stone_pickaxe in the inventory, which can help collect wood or stone. However, the player is not yet close to a tree
to collect more wood, and although they see a cow, it is 5 steps away.
5. Priority 5: Sleep - Yes, the requirements are met. The player’s energy level is below maximum, so they can sleep. However,
the player must find a safe place to sleep first, like a shelter or cave.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_east) succeeded because there was a flat path in the east direction, allowing the player
to move there without any obstacles.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move (Direction: West, East, North, or South). The player can
move to explore the environment and locate a water source or other resources. This action can be executed since there
is flat ground for movement in various directions.

1. Grass: No requirements, so they are met. You can interact with it.
2. Stone: Requires a pickaxe (wood, stone, or iron) to mine. You have both wood and stone pickaxes in your inventory, so
requirements are met.
3. Tree: Requires an axe or hands to chop it down. You don’t have an axe in your inventory, but you can use your hands, so
you can still interact with it.
4. Table: Requires wood to make and place. You have 1 wood in your inventory, so requirements are met if you want to make
another table.
5. Furnace: Requires stone to make and place. You don’t have stone in your inventory, so if you want to make another furnace,
you need to collect stone first.
6. Cow: No specific requirement for interaction. You can interact with it.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Top Sub-task: Collect Drink
Requirements: Find a water source like a lake or river to collect drink.
The player should first look for a water source in their surroundings. If not visible, the player can try moving in
different directions (north, south, east, or west) to explore the environment and locate a water source. Once found,
the player should move towards the water source and collect drink to replenish their thirst level.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move East (Move closer to the water source)

2. Priority 2: Move West (Move closer to the water source)
Requirements met: Yes, flat ground is present to the left of the agent.
3. Priority 3: Move North (Move closer to the water source)
Requirements met: Unknown, as the player’s observation does not provide information about northward conditions.
4. Priority 4: Move South (Move closer to the water source)
Requirements met: Unknown, as the player’s observation does not provide information about southward conditions.
5. Priority 5: Collect Drink (Replenish thirst level)
Requirements met: No, the player is not currently facing a water source (lake or river). They need to move closer to a water
source first.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
260

--- PAGE 261 ---
It is not clear if the last player action "do" succeeded because there is no information about the intended outcome or what
the player was trying to do. The surrounding environment and the player’s status and inventory remain unchanged
between steps 338 and 340, which indicates that nothing significant occurred as a result of the action. It’s possible
that the "do" action was not valid for the current context or lacked a specific target.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move East (Move closer to the water source), since its
requirement is met with flat ground present to the right of the agent.

the player’s thirst, which is currently low (2/9).
3. Priority 3: Move towards a Cow - Requirement: Flat ground in the direction of movement. The player should get closer to
the cow to be able to eat and restore their food.
4. Priority 4: Do (eat cow) - Requirement: Facing the cow; having the necessary tool (preferably a crafted sword). Eating
the cow will restore the player’s food.
5. Priority 5: Sleep - Requirement: Energy level is below maximum. Sleeping will help restore the player’s energy, which is

not mention any water nearby.
3. Priority 3: Move towards a Cow - Yes, the requirement is met. The player can move towards the cow by navigating the flat
ground in the cow’s direction (south-west).
4. Priority 4: Do (eat cow) - Not yet, as the player needs to get closer to the cow and face it before meeting the
requirement.
5. Priority 5: Sleep - Partially, the energy requirement (7/9) is met. However, finding a safe place to sleep is not
mentioned in the observation, so this requirement remains uncertain.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
We cannot determine if the last player action ("do") succeeded because there is no information provided about what the
player was trying to do in that step. The game observation remains the same between steps 342 and 344, so it is
unclear what the intended outcome or interaction was.

2. Have an empty container (such as a bottle or bucket) to collect the water. If you don’t have a container, you’ll need to
craft one.
What the player should do first:
Since the player’s current drink level is low, finding a water source should be the immediate priority. It is important to
explore the environment, moving either east or west to locate a water source such as a lake, river, or small pond.
Once the water source is found, the player can drink directly from it until they find or craft a suitable container
for portability.

dangerous creatures.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move East or Move West: Yes, the requirements are met. The player faces a path in both directions (east and
west), and needs to explore their surroundings to find a water source.
2. Priority 2 - Drink: Currently, the requirements are not met. The player needs to find a water source (lake or river)
first by exploring the environment.
3. Priority 3 - Move North or Move South: Yes, the requirements are met. There is a stone to the north, and moving south has
no obstacles mentioned in the recent observation, indicating the player can choose either direction to explore

- After finding a water source and securing their thirst level, the player should focus on placing a table to begin
crafting better tools and weapons.
4. Priority 4 - Make Wood Sword: Requirement: Nearby table; wood in inventory.
- Once the table is placed, the player should craft a wood sword to be prepared to defend themselves against any monsters
they may encounter.
5. Priority 5 - Sleep: Requirement: Energy level is below maximum.

--- PAGE 275 ---
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move East: Requirements: Flat ground right to the agent.
- This requirement is met, as there appears to be no indication of an obstacle or uneven terrain to the agent’s right.
2. Move North/South: Requirements: Flat ground above/below the agent.
- This requirement is met, as the agent’s observation mentions a path 1 step to the south, implying flat ground. The agent
’s surroundings also don’t mention any obstacles to the north, so we can assume flat ground in that direction as
well.
3. Place Table: Requirements: Wood in inventory.
- This requirement is met, as the agent’s inventory shows 1 wood.
4. Make Wood Sword: Requirements: Nearby table; wood in inventory.
- This requirement is partly met since the agent has wood in their inventory. However, they must place a table first
before crafting the wood sword.
5. Sleep: Requirements: Energy level is below maximum.
- This requirement is met since the agent’s energy level is currently 7/9, which is below maximum.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
It’s not clear if the last player action "do" succeeded or not, as there is no observable change or result provided in the
observations for step 358. The "do" action typically requires the player to face a creature or material and have the
necessary tool, but it’s unclear if these requirements were met.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (finding and consuming water):
1. Locate a water source such as a lake, river, or pond in the game environment.
2. Ensure there are no immediate hazards around the water source to avoid any trouble.
3. Move towards the water source safely, navigating through any obstacles or terrain.
The first thing the player should do is look around the environment for any signs of a water source. This can be achieved by
exploring their surroundings and keeping an eye on the landscape for any bodies of water nearby. Once located, make
sure the area is safe and then approach the water source to consume water and increase the drink level.

traversable terrain. This allowed the player to move west without any obstacles blocking their path.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is:
1. Move to find a water source (Move West, Move East, Move North, Move South)
Requirement: Flat ground in the direction of movement.
Since the other action requirements are not met, the player should focus on finding a water source to restore their thirst
level. They can move in any direction where there is flat ground.

Question: What was the last action taken by the player?
Answer:
The last action taken by the player was "move_east."
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
1. Grass: No requirements for interaction, so yes, the requirements are met.
290

--- PAGE 291 ---
2. Stone: You have a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in your inventory, so yes, the requirements for collecting stone are
met.
3. Path: No requirements for interaction, so yes, the requirements are met.
4. Tree: You have a wood_pickaxe in your inventory, so yes, the requirements for collecting wood are met.
5. Table: You already have a table in your vicinity, so yes, the requirements for crafting with the table are met.
6. Zombie: You don’t have a sword in your inventory, so no, the requirements for defeating the zombie are not met. You need
to craft either a wood, stone, or iron sword to interact with the zombie effectively.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Craft a sword to defend against the zombie (Priority: 5/5). Since there’s a zombie nearby, crafting a sword should be the
highest priority for self-defense.
2. Collect wood from the tree to have enough resources for crafting and building (Priority: 4/5). Wood is essential for
various crafting recipes and building structures, so it’s important to gather more.
3. Increase drink level by finding a water source (Priority: 4/5). Your drink level is 1/9, which is quite low. Finding a
water source to restore your thirst level is crucial for survival.
4. Find food and increase your food level (Priority: 3/5). Your food level is also quite low (3/9), although not as critical
as your drink level. Finding and consuming food should be done after addressing the more pressing priorities.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
The top sub-task is to craft a sword to defend against the zombie. The requirements for crafting a sword (either wood, stone,
or iron) are as follows:
1. Be near the crafting table (there’s a table 3 steps to your south-east).
2. Have the necessary resources in your inventory.
The wood sword requires wood in your inventory. The stone sword requires wood and stone in your inventory. The iron sword
requires wood, coal, and iron in your inventory.
Since you already have wood (1), coal (2), and iron (1) in your inventory, you can make an iron sword for better defense.
First, move 3 steps south-east to reach the crafting table. Then, craft the iron sword using the wood, coal, and iron that
you already have in your inventory.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move South-East (3 steps) - Requirement: Flat ground in the desired direction (south-east).
Reason: Moving towards the crafting table to create a sword.
2. Priority 2: Make Iron Sword - Requirements: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, and iron in inventory.
Reason: To be able to defend against the zombie.
3. Priority 3: Move North (2 steps) - Requirement: Flat ground in the desired direction (north).
Reason: Engage with the zombie once the iron sword is crafted.
4. Priority 4: Defeat Zombie - Requirements: No specific requirement.
Reason: To eliminate the zombie threat and survive the encounter.
5. Priority 5: Drink water - Requirement: Access to a water source (lake, river, or any other water source).
Reason: To replenish the player’s thirst, which is currently at 1/9.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move South-East (3 steps): Yes, the requirements are met. The ground in the southeast direction is not explicitly
mentioned, but considering the path and the table, it should be flat ground.
2. Make Iron Sword: No, the requirements are not met. Although the player has iron and a nearby table, they also need to be
near a furnace. The furnace’s location is not given in the recent observations.
3. Move North (2 steps): Yes, the requirements are met. Moving north twice brings the player closer to the zombie and will
be a valid action.
4. Defeat Zombie: No, the requirements are not met yet. While there are no specific inventory requirements for this action,
it is recommended to have a sword first (ideally the iron sword) to successfully defeat the zombie. Since the player
hasn’t crafted an iron sword yet, it would be better to wait until they do.
5. Drink water: No, the requirements are not met. Currently, there is no mention of a water source in the recent
observations. The player needs to find a water source (lake, river, etc.) to drink from it.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action "move_east" succeeded. The player was able to move to the east because there was a path (flat
ground) in that direction, allowing the player to move without any obstacles.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from above is to "Move South-East (3 steps)" considering that it meets the requirements of flat
ground in the desired direction, and it brings the player closer to the crafting table.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:

locate a water source, such as a lake, and interact with it to replenish their drink level.
2. Increase Food level: Priority 4. The player’s food level is at 3/9, which is low. They should focus on finding a source
of food, like animals to hunt or plants to gather, to increase their food level.
3. Defend against the Zombie: Priority 3. There is a zombie 3 steps to the north, posing a potential threat. The player
should prepare to defend themselves by crafting a weapon or using their current tools, like the wood_pickaxe or
stone_pickaxe, to attack the zombie if necessary.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for the top sub-task (Increase Drink level):
1. Find a water source such as a lake, river, or well.
2. Interact with the water source to drink and replenish the drink level.
What should the player do first:
The player should first try to locate a water source nearby, like a lake or river, by exploring the area around them. They
should move in a direction where they might find a water source or remember seeing one in previous steps of the game.
Once they have found a water source, they should interact with it to drink and increase their drink level.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - As the player faces grass at their front, moving
west brings them closer to the grass, which can help them find a nearby water source.
2. Priority 2: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - Moving north will help the player avoid the zombie
and possibly come across water or other resources.
3. Priority 3: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent) - If moving west or north doesn’t provide any water
source or if the player wants to explore further in search of water, moving east is the next option.
4. Priority 4: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent) - Moving south might provide the player with more
exploration options; however, it will bring them closer to the zombie, which increases the risk.
292

--- PAGE 293 ---
5. Priority 5: Do (Facing creature or material; have necessary tool) - While searching for a water source, the player can
interact with materials or creatures they come across, such as mining stone, cutting wood, or fighting monsters. But
only if they have the necessary tool and health/energy to perform the action.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
Based on the player’s current observations and status:
1. Priority 1: Move West: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (path) to the player’s left (west).
2. Priority 2: Move North: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (path) above the player (north).
3. Priority 3: Move East: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (path) to the player’s right (east).
4. Priority 4: Move South: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (grass) below the player (south).
5. Priority 5: Do: This action requires more context, as it depends on the material or creature the player is facing and the
necessary tool they possess. Currently, the player has a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in their inventory. If the
action involves mining stone or cutting wood, the player meets the requirements. However, if the action involves
combat with the zombie, the player does not have a sword and may need to craft one first.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action "move_south" succeeded because the player was able to face grass at their front (south) without
any obstacles or restrictions in their way.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list, considering the player’s current situation, would be Priority 1: Move West. This
action meets the requirement of flat ground left to the agent, and it brings the player closer to the grass, which can
potentially help them find a nearby water source.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Increase Food and Drink levels (Priority: 5/5) - To ensure survival, prioritize finding a source of food (e.g., hunting
the nearby cow) and drink (e.g., locating a lake or river to drink from).
2. Craft a suitable weapon (Priority: 4/5) - Crafting a wood sword or a stone sword will help you defend yourself more
effectively against the zombie and other potential threats.
3. Collect more resources (Priority: 3/5) - Continue collecting wood, stone, and iron to craft better tools and weapons, and
progress further in the game.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Requirements for increasing Food and Drink levels:
1. Find sources of food and drink - Locate a lake, river, or other water source to drink from and locate animals, plants, or
other food sources.
2. Craft required tools or weapons (if necessary) - For hunting animals, such as the nearby cow, you might need to craft a
weapon like a wood or stone sword. For gathering fruits or plants, you might need to craft tools like a sickle or a
hoe.
The player should first focus on finding a water source to increase their drink level, as it is at 1/9. They should also be
prepared to hunt the nearby cow to increase their food level, which is at 2/9.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move to a water source - Requirement: Locate a lake, river, or other water source nearby to increase the
drink level. (Move North, South, East, or West based on observations)
2. Priority 2: Drink from the water source - Requirement: Be adjacent to a water source (Collect Drink)
3. Priority 3: Craft a weapon to hunt animals for food - Requirement: Have sufficient materials (wood or stone) and be near
a crafting table. (Make Wood Sword, Make Stone Sword according to existing inventory)
4. Priority 4: Move closer to the cow - Requirement: Locate the cow and move in the appropriate direction to get closer to
it. (Move North, South, East, or West)
5. Priority 5: Hunt the cow - Requirement: Be adjacent to the cow and have a weapon ready for use. (Do or Eat Cow, depending
on the context provided by the game)
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Move to a water source: The player has not currently observed a water source nearby, so this requirement is not met.
2. Drink from the water source: As there is no water source observed, this requirement is not met.
3. Craft a weapon to hunt animals for food: The player has already crafted a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe. Although not
ideal weapons, they can potentially be used as weapons. The player can also use nearby wood from their inventory to
craft a wood sword if they go to a crafting table. So, this requirement is partially met.
4. Move closer to the cow: The player observed a cow 5 steps to the south-west. The player can move west or south to get
closer to the cow. This requirement is met.
5. Hunt the cow: Since the player is not adjacent to the cow and needs to move closer to it, the requirement for this action
is not currently met.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:

Action: Collect Drink
Requirements: Find a lake or water source to restore thirst.
Priority 5:
Action: Sleep
Requirements: Energy level is below maximum (Player’s energy is currently 7/9, so they will need to rest at some point)
Note: The priorities above should be addressed based on the player’s current needs, focusing on health, food, drink, and
energy management.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
For each action in the list, let’s check if the requirements are met based on the latest player observation:
Priority 1 (Highest):
Action: Do (Attack the Zombie)
Requirements: Face the zombie directly, have wood_pickaxe or other weapon equipped.
Requirements Met: Yes (Player faces the zombie directly and has a wood_pickaxe)
Priority 2:
Action: Move South
Requirements: Flat ground below the agent.
Requirements Met: Cannot confirm based on the observations provided. The southern terrain is not mentioned, so it is unclear
if there is flat ground below the agent.
Priority 3:
Action: Do (Chase the cow)
Requirements: Facing the cow directly, once closer to the cow, chase it to increase food.
Requirements Met: Not yet. The player should move closer to the cow by moving south first (if flat ground is available),
then face the cow directly and chase it.
Priority 4:
Action: Collect Drink
Requirements: Find a lake or water source to restore thirst.
Requirements Met: No. There is no mention of a water source in the player’s observations. The player needs to find a lake or
water source to drink from.
Priority 5:
Action: Sleep
Requirements: Energy level is below maximum.
Requirements Met: Yes, the player’s energy is 7/9, so they would be able to sleep when necessary.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
301

--- PAGE 302 ---
It is unclear whether the last player action "do" succeeded or not, as there is no noticeable change in the player’s status
or environment between the two observations. It could have been an unsuccessful attempt or an action that had no
significant impact.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list above is:
Priority 1 (Highest):
Action: Do (Attack the Zombie)
Requirements: Face the zombie directly, have wood_pickaxe or other weapon equipped.
Requirements Met: Yes (Player faces the zombie directly and has a wood_pickaxe)

Question: Action
Answer:
Move West
Question: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its
requirement.
Answer:
- Stone: Provides stone as a resource, required for crafting stone tools and weapons, as well as a furnace. Requires a wood
pickaxe to collect.
- Path: This is a navigational feature and does not directly provide a resource.
- Tree: Provides wood as a resource, required for crafting wooden items and building structures. Requires no specific tool
to collect but using an axe would make the process faster.
- Table: Provides a crafting station for creating tools and weapons. Requires wood to create and place.
- Cow: Provides food when defeated. Requires no specific tool to defeat, but using a weapon, like a sword, will make the
process faster.
- Zombie: This enemy could potentially drop items and resources when defeated, such as rotten flesh which can be used as a
low-quality food source. Can be defeated with any weapon but using a sword would be more effective.
- Grass: Generally doesn’t provide a resource directly but sometimes can drop seeds for planting crops when broken. Requires
no specific tool to collect.
Question: What was the last action taken by the player?
Answer:
The last action taken by the player was "do."
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
- Stone: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction, as the player has a wood_pickaxe in their inventory.
- Path: There are no requirements for interacting with the path since it’s a navigational feature.
- Tree: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction. Although the player doesn’t have an axe, they can still gather wood
without a specific tool.
- Table: The player can interact with the table to craft items since the table is already placed.
- Cow: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction. The player can attempt to defeat the cow even without a weapon,
although a weapon would make the process quicker.
- Zombie: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction. The player can attempt to defeat the zombie even without a weapon,
although a weapon like a sword would be more effective.
- Grass: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction, as there is no specific tool needed to collect grass.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Quench thirst (Priority: 5): The player has a drink level of 1/9, so finding water to drink is essential. Look for a
water source, like a lake, and drink from it.
2. Increase food level (Priority: 4.5): The player has a food level of 2/9. There are cows nearby which can be defeated to
obtain food, or they can look for other sources like plants.
3. Avoid or Defeat Zombie (Priority: 4): A zombie is two steps to the south-east, posing a potential threat. The player can
either avoid the zombie by moving away or engage and try to defeat it using the available tools.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
Top sub-task: Quench thirst (Priority: 5)
302

--- PAGE 303 ---
Requirements:
1. Locate a water source (e.g. lake, river) within the game.
2. Move towards the water source.
3. Interact with the water source to drink water.
First, the player should look around the environment to spot a water source. Once found, move towards it and then interact
with it to drink water and increase the drink level.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Action: Move West (Priority: 4)
Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent.
Reason: There is grass 1 step to the west, which might lead the player to find water.
2. Action: Move East (Priority: 1)
Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent.
Reason: The player is currently facing grass to the east, but it didn’t mention any water sources nearby.
3. Action: Move South (Priority: 3)
Requirement: Flat ground below the agent.
Reason: Moving south puts the player closer to both the cow and more visible game elements, potentially increasing chances
of finding water.
4. Action: Do (Priority: 2)
Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool.
Reason: This action is useful for interacting with the environment, either to collect resources, craft items or fight
creatures. However, as the player is currently facing grass without any tool, its priority is lower at the moment.
5. Action: Sleep (Priority: 5)
Requirement: Energy level is below maximum.
Reason: The player’s energy level is not full, but still at 7/9. Though not urgent, sleeping would restore energy and make
it easier to perform other actions in the future.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Action: Move West
Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent.
Are requirements met? Yes, there is flat grass 1 step to the west.
2. Action: Move East
Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent.
Are requirements met? Yes, there is flat grass to the east.
3. Action: Move South
Requirement: Flat ground below the agent.
Are requirements met? Not specified, as there is no information about the terrain to the south in the provided player
observations.
4. Action: Do
Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool.
Are requirements met? No, the player is currently facing grass and doesn’t have a tool specifically for grass in their
inventory.
5. Action: Sleep
Requirement: Energy level is below maximum.
Are requirements met? Yes, the player’s energy level is at 7/9, which is below the maximum.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
I cannot determine if the last player action succeeded or not, because there is no information about the outcome of the
action "do." Additionally, the observations at steps 394 and 396 do not provide enough context to judge the success of
the action.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from the list is to Move West, as it fulfills the requirement of having flat ground to the west,
and it might lead the player to find water sources.

Question: What was the last action taken by the player?
Answer:
The last action taken by the player was move_west.
Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?
Answer:
1. Stone: Yes, the requirements are met. You have a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in your inventory, which allows you to
collect stone.
2. Path: Yes, there are no specific requirements to interact with the path, and it is simply used for easier movement and
navigation.
3. Tree: Yes, there are no specific tool requirements to collect wood from the tree, but having an axe would make the
process faster.
4. Table: Yes, the requirements are met. You have already placed a table, and you can interact with it to craft tools and
weapons as needed.
5. Cow: Yes, you can interact with the cow without any specific requirements. However, having a weapon such as a sword would
make it easier to kill the cow for food.
6. Zombie: Yes, you can interact with the zombie without any specific requirements. However, having a weapon such as a sword
would make it easier to defend yourself and defeat the zombie.
Since your food and drink levels are low, it is crucial to interact with the cow for food and find a water source to drink
soon. Also, keep an eye on your energy level and find a safe place to rest when needed.
Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Find a water source and drink to replenish thirst level (Priority: 5/5) - Your thirst level is at 0/9, making it an
urgent task to find a water source for drinking and prevent negative effects or death from dehydration.
2. Kill the cow for food and eat to replenish hunger level (Priority: 4/5) - Your food level is at 2/9, which is quite low.
Killing the cow and eating the meat would help in restoring your hunger level and maintaining good health.
3. Find a safe place to rest and sleep to replenish energy level (Priority: 3/5) - Your energy level is at 6/9, which is
still reasonable but will need replenishing eventually. Finding a safe place to rest will help ensure that you regain
your energy without interruptions from potential dangers like monsters.
Remember to monitor your health, food, drink, and energy levels throughout the game and to adjust your priorities as needed.
Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?
Answer:
For the top sub-task of finding a water source and drinking to replenish thirst level, the requirements are:
1. Locate a water source such as a lake, river, or pond in the game world.
2. Approach the water source safely, ensuring the path is clear of any monsters or hazards.
3. Interact with the water source to drink and replenish your thirst level.
The player should first focus on locating a water source in their vicinity. Since the player’s current observations do not
show any nearby water, they should explore the surrounding area by moving in different directions (north, south, east,
or west) and observing their environment for any signs of water sources.
Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all
actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move (Move East/West/North/South): Flat ground in the chosen direction. The player should explore the
surroundings to find a water source, as their drink level is very low.
2. Priority 2: Do: Facing water source. The player must drink water to replenish thirst once the water source is located.
3. Priority 3: Do: Facing cow with wood/stone/iron sword (as the player doesn’t possess a weapon currently). The player
needs to defeat the cow for food to replenish their food level.
304

--- PAGE 305 ---
4. Priority 4: Make Wood Sword: Nearby table and wood in inventory. Crafting a wood sword with the wood in the inventory and
the table 5 steps south-east will help the player defeat the cow for food.
5. Priority 5: Move closer to the table (Move East/South). Flat ground in the chosen direction. The player needs to approach
the table to craft the wood sword.
Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?
Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move (Move East/West/North/South): Yes, the requirements are met. There is flat ground in each direction for
the player to move.
2. Priority 2: Do: Facing water source: No, the requirements are not met. The player has not found a water source yet.
3. Priority 3: Do: Facing cow with wood/stone/iron sword: No, the requirements are not met. The player does not have a sword
to defeat the cow.
4. Priority 4: Make Wood Sword: Yes, the requirements are met. The player has wood in their inventory, and there is a table
nearby (5 steps to the southeast).
5. Priority 5: Move closer to the table (Move East/South): Yes, the requirements are met. There is flat ground in each
direction for the player to approach the table.
Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?
Answer:
Yes, the last player action (move_west) succeeded because there was flat ground (grass) to the west, allowing the player to
move in that direction.
Question: Choose the best executable action from above.
Answer:
The best executable action from above is Priority 1: Move (Move East/West/North/South). The player should explore the
surroundings to find a water source, as their drink level is very low, and the requirements for this action are met.
