ABSTRACT
Advances in Visually Rich Document Understanding (VrDU) have
enabled information extraction and question answering over doc-
uments with complex layouts. Two tropes of architectures have
emerged—transformer-based models inspired by LLMs, and Graph
Neural Networks. In this paper, we introduce DocGraphLM, a novel
framework that combines pre-trained language models with graph
semantics. To achieve this, we propose 1) a joint encoder architec-
ture to represent documents, and 2) a novel link prediction approach
to reconstruct document graphs. DocGraphLM predicts both direc-
tions and distances between nodes using a convergent joint loss
function that prioritizes neighborhood restoration and downweighs
distant node detection. Our experiments on three SotA datasets
show consistent improvement on IE and QA tasks with the adop-
tion of graph features. Moreover, we report that adopting the graph
features accelerates convergence in the learning process druing
training, despite being solely constructed through link prediction.

Information extraction from visually-rich documents (VrDs), such
as business forms, receipts, and invoices in the format of PDF or
image has gained recent traction. Tasks such as field identification
and extraction and entity linkage are crucial to digitizing VrDs
and building information retrieval systems on the data. Tasks that
require complex reasoning such as Visual Question Answering
over documents require modeling the spatial, visual, and semantic
signals in VrDs. Therefore, VrD Understanding is concerned with
modeling the multi-modal content in image documents. Previous
research has explored the use of encoding text, layout, and image
features in a layout language model or multi-modal setting to im-
prove downstream tasks. For example, LayoutLM and its variants
[7,23,24] use image and layout information to enhance the repre-
sentation of text, thereby improving performance on various tasks.
However, models using Transformer mechanisms pose a challenge
to representing spatially distant semantics, such as table cells far
from their headers or contents across line breaks. In light of these
limitations, a few studies [ 25,27] have proposed using graph neural
networks (GNNs) to model relationships and structures between
text tokens or segments in documents. Although these models
alone still underperform layout language models, they demonstrate
the potential of incorporating additional structured information to
improve document representation.
Motivated by this, we introduce a novel framework called Doc-
GraphLM that integrates document graph semantics and the seman-
tics derived from pre-trained language models to improve document
representation. As depicted in Figure 1, the input to our model is
embeddings of tokens, positions, and bounding boxes, which form
the foundation of the document representation. To reconstruct the
document graph, we propose a novel link prediction approach that
predicts directions and distances between nodes by using a joint
loss function, which balances the classification and regression loss.
Additionally, the loss encourages close neighborhood restoration
while downgrading detections on farther nodes. This is achieved
by normalizing the distance through logarithmic transformation,
treating nodes separated by a specific order-of-magnitude distance
as semantically equidistant.
Our experiments on multiple datasets including FUNSD, CORD,
and DocVQA, show the superiority of the model in a consistent
manner. Furthermore, the incorporation of graph features is foundarXiv:2401.02823v1  [cs.CL]  5 Jan 2024

tions of our work as follows:
•we propose a novel architecture that integrates a graph neu-
ral network with pre-trained language model to enhance
document representation;

reconstruction, and a joint loss function that emphasizes
restoration on nearby neighbor nodes;

2 RELATED WORK
Transformer-based architectures have been successfully applied to
layout understanding tasks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art
(SotA) results [ 3,13,14,16,21,22]. Studies such as LayoutLM [ 23]
and LayoutLMv2 [ 24] fuse text embeddings with visual features
using a region proposal network, allowing the models to be trained
on objectives such as Masked Visual Language Model (MVLM) and
spatial aware attention, resulting in improved performance on com-
plex tasks such as VQA and form understanding. TILT [ 9] augments
the attention by adding bias to capture relative 2-D positions, which
has shown excellent performance on DocVQA leaderboard. Struc-
turalLM [ 12] makes the most of the interactions of cells where each
cell shares the same bounding boxes.
The use of GNNs [ 20] to represent documents allows information
to propagate more flexibly. In GNN-based VrDU models, documents
are often represented as graphs of tokens and/or sentences, and
edges represent spatial relationships among them, e.g. capturing
K-Nearest Neighbours. GNN-based models can be used for various
document-grounded tasks such as text classification [ 25,27] or key
information extraction [ 2,26]. However, their performance still
lags behind that of layout language models. This is because graph
representation alone is insufficient to capture the rich semantics of
a document. In cases where GNN-based models substantially out-
perform layout language models, they are often larger and focused
on specific tasks [ 10]. In this paper, we propose a framework that
combines the rich semantics of layout language models with therobust structural signal captured by GNN models. We demonstrate
how the addition of graph semantics can enhance the performance
of layout language models on IE and QA tasks, and improve model
convergence.
3 DOCGRAPHLM: DOCUMENT GRAPH
LANGUAGE MODEL
3.1 Representing document as graph
In GNN, a graph consists of nodes and edges. In the context of
representing document as graph, the nodes represent text segments
(i.e. groups of adjacent words) and the relationships between them
are represented as edges. Text segments from image documents can
be obtained through Optical Character Recognition tools, which
often capture the tokens as bounding boxes of various sizes.
To generate the edges between nodes, we adopt a novel heuristic
named Direction Line-of-sight (D-LoS), instead of the commonly
used K-nearest-neighbours (KNN) [ 19] or𝛽-skeleton approach [ 11].
The KNN approach may result in dense, irrelevant rows or columns
being treated as neighbours, ignoring the fact that some key-value
pairs in a form can be farther apart nodes. To address this, we
adopt the D-LoS approach, where we divide the 360-degree horizon
surrounding a source node into eight discrete 45-degree sectors,
and we determine the nearest node with respect to the source
node within each sector. These eight sectors define eight directions
with respect to the source node. This definition is inspired by the
pre-training task reported in StrucTexT [ 14] which applies this
approach to construct its graph representation.
Node representation. A node has two features — text seman-
tics and node size. The text semantics can be obtained through
token embeddings (e.g. from language models), while the node
size is expressed by its dimensions on 𝑥and𝑦coordinates, math-
ematically𝑀=emb([𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ,ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡])were𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ =𝑥2−𝑥1and
ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 =𝑦2−𝑦1, given that(𝑥1,𝑦1)and(𝑥2,𝑦2)are the coordinates
of top left corner and bottom right corner of the segment bounding
box. Intuitively, the node size is a significant indicator because it
helps differentiate font size and potentially the semantic role of the
segment, e.g., title, caption, and body. Thus, we denote a node input

as𝐸𝑢=emb(𝑇𝑢)⊕𝑀𝑢, where𝑢={1,2,...,𝑁}indicates the 𝑢th
node in a document and 𝑇𝑢stands for the texts inside the node 𝑢.
We learn the node representation by reconstructing the docu-
ment graph using GNN, expressed as ℎ𝐺𝑢=GNN(𝐸𝑢). Details on
learningℎ𝐺𝑢are described in Section 3.2.
Edge representation. To express the relationships between two
nodes, we use their polar features, including relative distance and
direction (one of eight possibilities). We compute the shortest Eu-
clidean distance, 𝑑, between the two bounding boxes. To reduce the
impact of distant nodes that may be less semantically relevant to
the source node, we apply a distance smoothing technique with log
transformation denoted as 𝑒dis=log(𝑑+1). The relative direction
𝑒dir∈{0,..., 7}for a pair of nodes is obtained from D-LoS. We
define a linkage, denoted as 𝑒𝑝=[𝑒dis,𝑒dir], to reconstruct the
document graph in section 3.2.
3.2 Reconstructing graph by link prediction
We predict two key attributes of the linkages 𝑒𝑝to reconstruct the
graph and frame the process as a multi-task learning problem.
The input to the GNN is the encoded node representations, and
the representation is passed through the message passing mecha-
nism on GNN, specifically:
ℎ𝐺,𝑙+1
𝑢 :=aggregate(ℎ𝐺,𝑙
𝑣,∀𝑣∈N(𝑢)), (1)
where𝑙is the layer of neighbors, N(𝑢)denotes the set of neighbors
of node𝑢, and aggregate(·)is an aggregation function that updates
the node representation.
We jointly train the GNN on two tasks — predicting the distance
and direction between nodes — to learn the node representation.
For distance prediction, we define a regression head ˆ𝑦𝑒𝑢,𝑣, which gen-
erates a scalar value through the dot-product of two node vectors,
and uses a linear activation, as presented in Equation 2.
ˆ𝑦𝑒
𝑢,𝑣=𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑟((ℎ𝐺
𝑢)⊤×ℎ𝐺
𝑣) (2)
For direction prediction, we define a classification head ˆ𝑦𝑑𝑢,𝑣that
assigns one of eight directions to each edge based on the element-
wise product between two nodes, expressed as follows:
ˆ𝑦𝑑
𝑢,𝑣=𝜎((ℎ𝐺
𝑢⊙ℎ𝐺
𝑣)×𝑊) (3)
whereℎ𝐺𝑢⊙ℎ𝐺𝑣is an element-wise product between two nodes and
𝑊is the learnable weight for the product vector. 𝜎is a non-linear
activation function.
We use MSE loss for distance regression and cross-entropy for
the direction classification, respectively. Then, the joint loss is:
𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠=∑︁
(𝑢,𝑣)∈batch[(𝜆·lossMSE(ˆ𝑦𝑒
𝑢,𝑣,𝑦𝑒
𝑢,𝑣)
+(1−𝜆)·lossCE(ˆ𝑦𝑑
𝑢,𝑣,𝑦𝑑
𝑢,𝑣)]·( 1−𝑟𝑢,𝑣)(4)
where𝜆is a tunable hyper-parameter that balances the weights
of the two losses, and 𝑟𝑢,𝑣is the normalization of the distance
𝑒dis, constrained to the interval [0,1], so that the value of 1−𝑟𝑢,𝑣
downweights distant segments and favors nearby segments.
3.3 Joint representation
The joint node representation, ℎ𝐶𝑢, is a combination of the language
model representation ℎ𝐿𝑢and the GNN representation ℎ𝐺𝑢throughTable 1: Statistics of visual document datasets. The differ-
ences between DocVQA and DocVQA†is introduced in Sec-
tion 4.1.

an aggregation function 𝑓(e.g., concatenation, mean, or sum) rep-
resented as ℎ𝐶𝑢=𝑓(ℎ𝐿𝑢,ℎ𝐺𝑢). In this work, we operationalize the
aggregation function 𝑓with concatenation at the token level. The
introduced node representations can be utilized as input for other
models to facilitate downstream tasks, e.g., IE_Head(ℎ𝐶𝑢)for entity
extraction and QA_Head (ℎ𝐶𝑢)for visual question answering task.
4 EXPERIMENTS
4.1 Datasets and baselines
We evaluate our models on two information extraction tasks across
three commonly used datasets: FUNSD [ 8], CORD [ 18], and DocVQA
[17]. FUNSD and CORD focus on entity-level extraction, while
DocVQA concentrates on identifying answer spans in image docu-
ments in a question-answering task. Dataset statistics are shown in
Table 1. Please refer to the citations for more details.
It is noted that the OCR files provided in DocVQA1contain a
small number of imperfect OCR outputs, e.g., text misalignment
and missing texts, which leads to failures in identifying the answers.
We can only use 32,553 samples for training and 4,400 samples for
validation. We denote the modified dataset as 𝐷𝑜𝑐𝑉𝑄𝐴†. In the
interest of ensuring fair comparison in our experiments, we have
maintained the use of the OCR outputs from the dataset.
As our baselines, we employ the SotA models that make use of
different features, including RoBERTa [15], BROS [6], DocFormer-
base [ 1], StructuralLM [ 12], LayoutLM [ 23], LayoutLMv3 [ 7] and
Doc2Graph [ 4]. RoBERTa is transformer model without any layout
or image features, BROS and StructuralLM adopt layout information
solely, DocFormer and LayoutLMv3 utilizes both layout and image
features, and Doc2Graph soly relies on document graph features.
4.2 Experimental setup
For FUNSD and CORD, we adopt the following training hyper-
parameters: epoch = 20, learning rate = 5e-5, and batch size = 6,
and trained our model on a single NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU.
For DocVQA, we apply the following training hyper-parameters:
epoch = 5, learning rate = 5e-5, and batch size = 4.
We adopt GraphSage [ 5] as our GNN model, as it has been proven
effective in document graph features[ 4]. For graph reconstruction,
we set a constant value 𝜆=0.5 throughout the experiment.
4.3 Results
The performance of DocGraphLM and other models on the FUNSD
dataset are presented in Table 2. Our model reaches the best F1

score at 88.77, achieved when it is paired with the LayoutLMv3-base
model. On the other hand, RoBERTa-base (which does not leverage
layout features) has the lowest F1 score of 65.37, but combining it
with DocGraphLM results in a 1.66 point improvement. Please note
scores with⋄are reported in the corresponding citations. The same
notation applies to other tables.
For the CORD dataset, the performance comparisons are shown
in Table 3, and the best performance is achieved by DocGraphLM
(LayoutLMv3-base) with an F1 score of 96.93, followed closely by
BROS. Similarly, even though RoBERTa-base alone achieves a much
lower score, DocGraphLM (RoBERTa-base) increases the F1 score
by 2.26 points.
Table 4 shows the model performance on the DocVQA test
dataset. The performance scores are obtained by submitting our
model output to the DocVQA leaderboard2, as ground-truth an-
swers are not provided to the public. Besides the overall score,
the model’s performances on sub-category tasks are also reported.
DocGraphLM (with LayoutLMv3-base) outperforms others in al-
most every aspect except pure text semantics, which shows the
model’s ability to model multi-modal semnatics effectively. The ta-
ble presents strong evidence towards the efficiency of DocGraphLM
in improving document representations, when layout language
models are augmented with our approach.
The superior performance across various datasets indicates that
using the graph representation proposed in DocGraphLM leads to
consistent improvements. A p-value less than 0.05 was received
when comparing the models’ performance across these datasets,
indicating a statistically significant improvement from our model.

4.4 Impact on convergence
We also observed that the training convergence speed is often faster
when supplementing the graph features than vanilla LayoutLM (V1
and V3 base models). For example, Figure 2 illustrates that the F1
score improves in a faster convergence rate within the first four
epochs, when testing on the CORD dataset. This could be due to
the graph features allowing the transformer to focus more on the
nearby neighbours, which eventually results in a more effective
information propagation process.

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presents a novel DocGraphLM framework incorporating
graph semantics with pre-trained language models to improve doc-
ument representation for VrDs. The proposed linkage prediction
method reconstructs the distance and direction between nodes, in-
creasingly down-weighting more distant linkages. Our experiments
on multiple downstream tasks on various datasets show enhanced
performance over LM-only baseline. Additionally, introducing the
graph features accelerates the learning process. As a future direc-
tion, we plan to incorporate different pre-training techniques for
different document segments. We will also examine the effect of
different linkage representations for graph reconstruction.
