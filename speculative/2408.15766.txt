ABSTRACT
Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage tar-
get LLM’s contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have
shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from
inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another
discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing specula-
tive sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmo-
nized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to
address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding infer-
ence overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context
alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves
2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, sur-
passing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%. The code is available at https://github.

1 I NTRODUCTION
Generative Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Tou-
vron et al., 2023), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. Never-
theless, efficiently decoding from these models poses a significant challenge due to the inherent
auto-regressive decoding mechanism, which restricts their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.
Speculative sampling (Chen et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023) offers a solution by leveraging addi-
tional resources to increase concurrency. Specifically, it employs an efficient draft model to generate
draft tokens auto-regressively, which are then concurrently verified by the target LLM. Based on the
verification results, a subset of draft tokens that preserves the same distribution as the target LLM is
accepted as the final output.
Leviathan et al. (2023) show that the practical performance of speculative sampling is highly re-
lated to two factors: the decoding cost of the draft model and its alignment with the target LLM.
To develop efficient draft models that are well-aligned with the target LLM, previous works pro-
pose to leverage the target LLM’s contextual information (Xiao et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b;c; Du
et al., 2024). For instance, EAGLE (Li et al., 2024b;c) employs previous hidden states of the target
LLM as the draft model’s input features. However, these approaches introduce inconsistent context
between training and decoding, as illustrated in Figure 2. During training, the draft model always
has access to the target LLM’s hidden states in previous timesteps. However, during decoding, the
draft model cannot access the target LLM’s hidden states for unverified timesteps, resulting in a con-
text misalignment between training and decoding. This issue can be viewed as a form of exposure
bias (Bengio et al., 2015; Wang & Sennrich, 2020) at the feature level in speculative sampling.
Another discrepancy is also observed between the objectives of the training and decoding stages.
During the decoding stage, the objective of the draft model is to propose tokens that the target LLM
is likely to assign high probabilities to (Li et al., 2024c; Miao et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024). In
this scenario, the draft model should focus more on recalling the desired tokens, while the specific

order of these tokens can be somewhat de-emphasized. Moreover, most LLM applications perform
nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) or top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018). For these decoding
objectives, tokens with high probabilities play a more significant role in determining the output.
Therefore, to develop efficient draft models, their training objectives should consider these properties
encountered in the decoding stage. To the best of our knowledge, previous works on training draft
models for speculative sampling have largely overlooked these decoding considerations.

an example to illustrate the context misalign-
ment, where the speculation starts from timestep
t.f(l)andf(s)represent hidden states from the
target LLM and the draft model. When decod-
ing draft token xt+2, the input context is incon-
sistent between training and decoding.In this paper, we introduce HArmonized Spec-
ulative Sampling (HASS), a novel approach
designed to address the aforementioned is-
sues by learning harmonized representations.
Specifically, to make draft models aware of the
decoding strategy, HASS extends the idea of
ranking distillation (Tang & Wang, 2018) from
the recommender system to speculative sam-
pling, resulting in a distillation loss focused
on the most probable tokens within the tar-
get distribution. To mitigate the previously
discussed context misalignment between train-
ing and decoding, HASS employs a context-
aligned training strategy. Together, these two
strategies of HASS improve the acceleration
performance without any inference overhead
and maintain training efficiency.
We conduct experiments across dialogue,
code generation, and mathematical reasoning
tasks using the MT-bench, HumanEval, and
GSM8K datasets, respectively. Building with
EAGLE-2 (Li et al., 2024c), HASS achieves
8%-16% acceptance length improvement over
it on LLaMA2-Chat 7/13B and LLaMA3-
Instruct 8/70B, resulting in 2.81x-4.05x wall-
clock time acceleration compared with the
vanilla inference on NVIDIA H800 GPU.
2 P RELIMINARY
Speculative sampling leverages the concept of speculative execution (Kung & Robinson, 1981;
Hennessy & Patterson, 2011) to reduce wall-clock time from more concurrency. Specifically, given
the target LLM M(l)that is the focus of acceleration, speculative sampling employs a draft model
2

--- PAGE 3 ---
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025
M(s)to speculatively and efficiently generate draft tokens. The conventional approach (Leviathan
et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023) decomposes the next step generation into three steps:
•M(s)proposes an unverified draft sequence with length Lby auto-regressive decoding.
•M(l)evaluates posterior probabilities of Ldraft tokens in parallel.
•τtokens that retain the target distribution are accepted by a modified rejection sampling
schema based on the draft sequence and the distribution gap.
Leviathan et al. (2023) demonstrate that the wall-clock time improvement ratio is directly propor-
tional to τ, while the arithmetic operation increment ratio is inversely proportional to τ. Conse-
quently, τ, also known as the acceptance length, plays a crucial role in determining the performance
of acceleration. This analysis also applies when using multiple draft sequences (Miao et al., 2024;
Li et al., 2024c;b; Sun et al., 2024). Note that τis closely related to the distribution gap between the
target LLM and the draft model. With efficient decoding requirements, the draft model typically has
limited capacity, resulting in a significant distribution gap compared to the target LLM. Fortunately,
during inference, the acceptance rate is primarily influenced by the alignment of distributions on
the desired tokens, i.e., the tokens to which the target LLM assigns high probabilities. However,
previous speculative sampling works mainly focus on the entire vocabulary set w.r.t. knowledge dis-
tillation from the target LLM (Li et al., 2024b; Zhou et al., 2024), thereby disconnecting the training
process from the practical decoding requirements.
EAGLE (Li et al., 2024b) is a lightweight draft model design, as shown in Figure 2. During decod-
ing, it utilizes the LM Head of the target LLM to generate draft tokens. Specifically, we assume that
the speculation starts from timestep t, meaning the first draft token is at timestep t+ 1. To generate
the draft token xt+1, the target LLM’s hidden state f(l)
t−1in the second-to-top layer is concatenated
with the embedding etto perform the input of the draft model. During training, EAGLE constructs a
regression task between f(l)s and the predicted hidden states f(s)s of the draft model. However, due
to the auto-regressive decoding, the draft model only accesses the target LLM’s features at the be-
ginning of the speculation. It uses the features produced by itself as input for subsequent steps. This
context misalignment, stemming from feature inaccuracies, leads to error accumulation and hinders
the performance of generating later draft tokens (Li et al., 2024b; Du et al., 2024). EAGLE-2 (Li
et al., 2024c) employs the same model design but works on dynamic drafting structures instead of a
static tree structure during the decoding stage, yet the aforementioned issue remains unresolved.
3 M ETHODOLOGY
As outlined before, previous speculative sampling methods suffer from disharmonies between train-
ing and decoding. This section introduces HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) to tackle
objective misalignment and context inconsistency through harmonized objective distillation and har-
monized context alignment, respectively, as described below.
3.1 H ARMONIZED OBJECTIVE DISTILLATION
HASS prioritizes the most decoding-desired tokens by leveraging the ranking distillation (Tang &
Wang, 2018) idea from the recommender system. Specifically, ranking distillation aims to train a
student model to assign higher ranks to the items that are top-ranked by the teacher model. In the
context of speculative sampling, the draft model and the target LLM serve as the student and the
teacher, respectively. Draft models with similar properties will perform at a higher acceptance rate
in the decoding stage. Consider the set of K tokens with the highest probabilities from the target
LLM’s probability distribution as ˆΩ⊂Ω, where Ωrepresents the entire vocabulary. HASS considers
the following Top-K distillation loss:
LTop-K =−X
x∈ˆΩq(x) logp(x), (1)
where qandpare the next token probability distributions of the target LLM and the draft model,
respectively. Note that, when integrated with EAGLE, the training stage can obtain ˆΩfrom hidden
states of the target LLM. This implies that the proposed loss function benefits from the same efficient

training cost as EAGLE. We evaluate the proposed Top-K distillation loss against six alternative
losses, such as BiLD (Li et al., 2024a) and Recall@k Surrogate loss (Patel et al., 2022), through
ablation studies.

and superscript (sj)denotes tensors from the j-th draft model forward. Note that during training
(sj)refers to calling jtimes draft model in a batch, while during inference (sj)refers to j-th auto-
regressive decoding.
HASS follows a context alignment schema that aligns training and decoding on their contexts. The
training procedure of HASS is divided into nsteps, enabling the draft model to utilize contex-
tual features consistent with those in the decoding stage and addressing the context inconsistency
by adapting the inaccurate features generated in previous HASS training steps. Specifically, it is
achieved by first taking the inaccurate feature from the last draft model as query, and then consider-
ing the inaccuracy accumulation in key-value part of the transformer block.
Formally, in the HASS training step j, given input token sequence x1, x2, .., x T, we optimize the
draft model M(s)with the following objective function:

P(l)is the auto-regressive probability distribution provided by the target LLM, the Aux-loss consists
of the proposed Top-K loss and the feature regression loss (following EAGLE), Head and ⊕stand
for the language modeling head and the concatenation operation respectively. When training tokens
in the entire sequence in parallel, the above formulation adapts the inaccurate features from previous
j−1steps for all positions except the first j−1positions. Note that compared to EAGLE, HASS
takes additional training overhead due to the extra n−1training steps for adapting inaccurate
features, while maintaining the same decoding overhead. To accelerate the training procedure, we
propose a modification to the attention mask mechanism, as outlined below:
• The first step mirrors the training stage of EAGLE. At timestep t+ 1, the draft model takes
the target model’s feature f(l)
tas input and produces the draft feature f(s1)
t+1. In this step, the
attention mask remains the same as the original causal mask without any modification.
• In the second step, features from the first step are incorporated. For instance, in the self-
attention mechanism at timestep t+ 1,f(s1)
tis used to calculate the current query. Keys
and values are derived from f(l)
:t⊕f(s1)
t, where f(l)
:tincludes features from timesteps earlier
thant. The attention mask is adjusted to ensure that the previous feature seen by f(s1)
iis
always f(l)
i−1, as shown in the ‘HASS Training Step 2’ part of Figure 3.
• For step j≥3, the feature from the previous step f(sj−1)
t is utilized to calculate the query
at timestep t+ 1, while keys and values are generated by f(l)
:t−j+2⊕f(s1)
t−j+2⊕. . .⊕f(sj−1)
t .
We empirically demonstrate that the acceleration effect converges with a small nso that the train-
ing of HASS is cost-efficient. The actual training overhead of HASS in terms of training speed,
computational cost, and GPU memory is investigated in Appendix A.8.

4 E XPERIMENT
4.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP
Target LLMs. LLaMA2-Chat 7/13B and LLaMA3-Instruct 8/70B.
Tasks. We conduct evaluations on three generation tasks. For multi-turn conversation, code genera-
tion, and mathematical reasoning tasks, we choose the MT-bench (Zheng et al., 2024), HumanEval
(Chen et al., 2021), and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) datasets, respectively. The batch size is set as
1 under all the experiments following Leviathan et al. (2023) and Zhou et al. (2024).
Metrics. HASS neither fine-tunes the target LLMs’ weights during training nor relaxes the accep-
tance conditions during decoding, making it a lossless acceleration method. Thus, the generation
quality is promised with no need for evaluation. We use the following two metrics to measure the
acceleration performance:
•Speedup Ratio : The actual test speedup ratio relative to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.
•Acceptance Length τ: The average number of tokens generated per drafting-verification
cycle, indicating the number of tokens accepted by the target LLM from the draft model.
Note that the speedup ratio is sensitive to the hardware due to variations in computing power, and
the acceptance length may be slightly affected by hardware due to numerical errors. Therefore, all
inference processes are conducted on NVIDIA H800 GPU.
Comparisons. The vanilla auto-regressive decoding is taken as the baseline, which serves as the
benchmark for speedup ratios (1.00x). We compare HASS with recent lossless speculative sampling
methods, including PLD (Saxena, 2023), Lookahead (Fu et al., 2023), Vanilla Speculative Sampling
(Chen et al., 2023), Medusa (Cai et al., 2024), EAGLE (Li et al., 2024b), and EAGLE-2 (Li et al.,
2024c). PLD and Lookahead are free of traning, which respectively use string matched from the
prompt and cached n-grams as draft tokens instead of generating draft tokens from a draft model’s
predicted probability distribution. Therefore, the results of PLD and Lookahead under temperature
= 1 are not reported in Table 1.

Implementation. Our code is built based on EAGLE-2’s open-source repository1. Experiments
on EAGLE and EAGLE-2 reuse draft model weights trained by Li et al. (2024b). For harmonized
objective distillation, K is set as 10, and the loss of harmonized objective distillation is added to
EAGLE’s original loss with a coefficient of w= 1.0. For harmonized context alignment, the draft
model is aligned for 3 steps during training. For dynamic tree structure, we set the total number
of draft tokens to 60 for all experiments with a draft tree depth of 6. We keep other settings, such
as the fixed training dataset, i.e., the ShareGPT2dataset with 68,000 dialogues, and the optimizer,
consistent with EAGLE-2.
4.2 E FFECTIVENESS & A BLATION STUDY
In this section, we first evaluate the effectiveness of HASS by comparing it with existing speculative
sampling methods on acceptance length and speedup ratio. Then, we conduct ablation studies on
harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Inspired by Yi et al. (2024),
we further conduct experiments by training on different proportions of the ShareGPT dataset to
investigate HASS’s scalability in the face of data sparsity (see Appendix A.6), and by evaluating
on the translation tasks to investigate HASS’s robustness across different task types (see Appendix
A.7). As shown from the results, HASS is more scalable than EAGLE-2 with fewer training data
and achieves promising improvements over EAGLE-2 on translation tasks consistent with results on
MT-bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K.
4.2.1 E FFECTIVENESS
We present different methods’ acceptance lengths and speedup ratios across three datasets in Tables
1 and 2, respectively. HASS performs the largest acceptance length and highest speedup ratio across
all datasets and LLMs we tested. Most methods achieve their best performance on the HumanEval
dataset, as the fixed templates in the code generation task are easier to draft and accelerate. Though
PLD and Lookahead are free of training, they consistently show poorer performance than Medusa,
EAGLE, EAGLE-2, and HASS.

Figure 4: Acceptance lengths τof HASS with
varied Ks and weights of the Top-K loss. The
results are conducted on LLaMA2-Chat 7B
and averaged over MT-bench, HumanEval, and
GSM8K datasets with temperature T ∈ {0,1}.We first study the effects of different K and
the weight wof the Top-K loss by varying
these hyper-parameters and summarize the re-
sults in Figure 4. Training with the Top-K loss
(w > 0) always improves performance com-
pared to training without the Top-K loss ( w=
0). HASS achieves the largest acceptance length
when w= 0.5. A small value of K may result
in performance degeneration, as the draft model
only focuses on the token with the highest prob-
ability and consequently neglects other potential
tokens. With a larger K, the Top-K loss gener-
ally brings better results, while the acceptance
length is the largest when K = 5.
Since the harmonized objective distillation can be implemented with any loss function that focuses
on the most probable tokens w.r.t. the target distribution, we further consider the following loss
functions and compare them with the Top-K Loss:
• Top-P Loss, where the ˆΩis formed by the most probable tokens whose cumulative proba-
bility is just larger than P.
• Normed Top-K Loss, where the target and draft distributions are both normalized over ˆΩ.
The normalization operation can be either linear or softmax.

• Bi-directional Top-K Loss, where the distillation is conducted over the most probable to-
kens w.r.t. the target distribution as well as the draft distribution.
• Recall@k Surrogate Loss (Patel et al., 2022), where a smooth approximation of the recall
metric is obtained and is differentiable for direct optimization.
• BiLD Loss (Li et al., 2024a), where the internal logits ranking information is captured by
constructing logits differences with long-tail noise filtered out.
After searching the optimal hyper-parameters for each of the compared loss functions, we summa-
rize their best results in Table 3. BiLD loss outperforms other loss functions under temperature T
= 0, while Top-K loss outperforms others under temperature T = 1. Generally, Top-K loss shows
the best performance. A better loss function may exist than Top-K loss to exploit the target LLM
further. We leave this topic in future works.
We also conduct an experiment with LLaMA2-Chat 7B, where the fixed training dataset is replaced
by the dataset generated by the target LLM (see Appendix A.4). We observe that when using non-
greedy decoding, the acceptance length increases from 4.92 to 5.19 averaging over three datasets.
Therefore, information obtained from harmonized objective distillation is not equivalent to direct
distillation from target-model-generated data.

Table 4: Acceptance lengths τof HASS with varied aligning steps in the harmonized context align-

We propose the harmonized context alignment, which eliminates the feature inconsistency of draft
models between the training and decoding stages. To study the effect of increasing the aligning
steps in the harmonized context alignment, we conduct experiments by varying the step number and
summarize the results in Table 4.
As the first training step of HASS is the same as EAGLE-2, we continually train EAGLE-2’s draft
model weights with the Top-K loss and consider it the baseline. Without harmonized context align-
ment (EAGLE-2 + Top-K), the draft model performs the worst across all datasets. Training with 3/4
8

steps of harmonized context alignment generally obtains the most considerable acceptance length.
When training with 5 steps of context alignment, the acceptance length decreases. We believe this
is caused by the draft model’s limited capacity, as it predicts less accurately on former steps’ tokens
when paying too much attention to the latter ones. Figure 5 shows the acceptance rate αacross
speculation steps on the MT-bench dataset following Li et al. (2024c). In later speculation steps,
HASS performs better acceptance rates than EAGLE-2, demonstrating the effectiveness of harmo-
nized context alignment.

Figure 5: Acceptance rates α(%) of HASS and EAGLE-2 across different speculation steps on the
MT-bench dataset with temperature T ∈ {0,1}.
As shown in Figure 5, the acceptance rates of HASS decrease compared to EAGLE-2 on LLaMA2-
Chat 13B and LLaMA3-Instruct 70B at the first step (0- α). The draft models degrade on the first
speculation step with much attention paid to the latter speculation steps, while the first step’s ac-
ceptance rates are crucial to larger acceptance lengths. We conduct experiments to emphasize the
significance of former speculation steps by reweighting the training loss from each step with a factor
β. In specific, the step j’s training loss will be multiplied by βj−1. Table 5 and Figure 6 show the ac-
ceptance lengths and acceptance rates of HASS with different reweight factors on LLaMA3-Instruct
70B over the MT-bench dataset, respectively. With the factor βdecreasing from 1.0 to 0.5, HASS
achieves better acceptance lengths with different temperatures. Correspondingly, we perceive that
the acceptance rate at the first speculation step is consistently higher with a smaller β, while the
acceptance rates at the latter speculation steps generally decline. When the factor βdecreases to 0.3,
too much emphasis is assigned to the first speculation step, leading to deterioration in acceptance
length. Since the further exploration of an appropriate trade-off between different speculation steps
is out of this paper’s scope, we leave it for future work.

5 R ELATED WORK
There have been a number of works on improving the acceptance rate of speculative sampling while
maintaining the target distribution. Most of them fall into two categories. (1) The former category
9

--- PAGE 10 ---
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025
is aligned training that tries to obtain draft models aligned with the target LLM before the decoding
stage. Zhou et al. (2024) propose a knowledge distillation approach and study several strategies
to improve the alignment. Li et al. (2024b) demonstrate that hidden states of the target LLM as
input of the draft model provide extra feature uncertainty information. Xiao et al. (2024) also utilize
hidden states of the target LLM and introduce an RNN-based draft model design that achieves a
comparable acceptance rate. GLIDE (Du et al., 2024) instead reuses the KV cache of the target
LLM. It also notices the context misalignment when using information from the target LLM, but
the proposed blockwise attention mask method can not solve the misalignment completely. (2)
The latter category is efficient decoding, which designs sophisticated decoding strategies to utilize
concurrency efficiently. Miao et al. (2024) propose to utilize multiple draft models and design a tree-
based attention mechanism to verify multiple draft sequences efficiently. Li et al. (2024c) introduce
a dynamic structure to save computation by pruning inefficient paths in the draft tree. Sun et al.
(2024) study improving the verification stage through optimal transportation. However, these works
tend to only consider training or decoding, ignoring the linkage of these two stages. This work
instead aims to link training and decoding, leading to harmonized speculative sampling.
6 C ONCLUSION
This paper introduces HASS, a harmonized speculative sampling solution that addresses dishar-
monies between training and decoding on their objectives and contexts. Compared to its closest
baseline, EAGLE-2, HASS improves the acceptance rate without any inference overhead. Experi-
ments conducted on LLaMA2-Chat 7/13B and LLaMA3-Instruct 8/70B demonstrate the effective-
ness and efficiency of HASS. Averaging on MT-bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K, HASS is 2.81x-
4.05x faster than vanilla auto-regressive decoding, 8%-20% faster than EAGLE-2.

A.2 H ARMONIZED CONTEXT ALIGNMENT ON TOKENS
In this section, we attempt to verify whether applying token alignment as well as feature alignment
brings better performance. In specific, we use the tokens generated by the draft model for training
in harmonized context alignment instead of using the tokens from training data. We apply feature
and token alignment to EAGLE-2’s draft model weights and summarize the results in Table 6 and
Figure 7.
Temperature = 0 Temperature = 1 Mean
EAGLE-2 4.44 4.23 4.34
Feature Only 4.83 4.60 4.72
Feature + Token (0.1) 4.81 4.57 4.69
Feature + Token (0.2) 4.78 4.51 4.65
Feature + Token (1.0) 4.28 4.11 4.20

the MT-bench dataset with temperature T ∈ {0,1}.

MT-bench dataset with temperature T ∈ {0,1}.
Feature only alignment brings the best performance, while adding token alignment leads to degen-
eration. With the probability of applying token alignment increasing from 0.1 to 1.0, the acceptance
length decreases consistently. As shown in Figure 7, more token alignment generally causes lower
acceptance rates. As a result, training with tokens generated by the draft model in harmonized
context alignment hurts the acceleration performance.

A.4 S ELF-DISTILLATION
In the main text, we use the fixed ShareGPT dataset to train draft models for a fair comparison
with EAGLE and EAGLE-2. Following existing speculative sampling methods (Zhou et al., 2024;
Cai et al., 2024), we further use target-model-generated outputs to distill the draft model from the
target model’s real output distribution, dubbed as self-distillation. In specific, we feed the prompts
from the ShareGPT dataset into the target models recursively with temperature set to 0 and collect
the responses as multi-turn conversations for self-distillation following Li et al. (2024b). To study
the effect of self-distillation, we conduct experiments on HASS and EAGLE-2 by training the draft
model with fixed data or model-generated data and summarize the results in Table 8.

Table 8: Speedup ratios and acceptance lengths τof HASS and EAGLE-2 with fixed or target-
model-generated training data. F and MG stand for ‘Fixed’ and ‘Model-Generated’, respectively.
L2 represents LLaMA2-Chat.
On LLaMA2-Chat 7B, self-distillation consistently brings improvements for HASS and EAGLE-
2. On LLaMA2-Chat 13B, self-distillation only achieves marginally better or comparable results,
which is consistent with the observation from Li et al. (2024b) (‘data from the target LLM marginally
improves performance’ in its section 4.3.3). Especially, the acceptance lengths of the self-distilled
HASS are lower than that of the vanilla HASS on the HumanEval dataset, while both the speedup ra-
tios and acceptance lengths of the self-distilled EAGLE-2 are lower than that of the vanilla EAGLE-2
on HumanEval and GSM8K datasets. It may be due to the code generation dataset HumanEval and
the mathematical reasoning dataset GSM8K being less similar to the training dataset ShareGPT
compared with MT-bench.
HASS outperforms EAGLE-2 on either fixed training data or model-generated training data. It
is noted that HASS trained on the fixed dataset even achieves better performance than EAGLE-2
trained on the model-generated data consistently. With self-distillation, HASS consistently achieves
more improvement or less degeneration in terms of the acceptance length compared with EAGLE-2.

A.5 D RAFTING HYPER -PARAMETERS
Li et al. (2024c) find that the draft token’s confidence score is strongly positively correlated with
the acceptance rate, and accordingly propose the context-aligned dynamic draft tree, which can be
dynamically adjusted with two hyper-parameters: ‘depth’ and ‘number of tokens’. ‘Depth’ decides
the draft tree’s depth during the expansion phase, while ‘number of tokens’ decides how many
draft tokens will be kept during the reranking phase. Increasing both these hyper-parameters surely
leads to a larger acceptance length. Nevertheless, sending more draft tokens into the target model for
verification causes a higher overhead in real applications. Therefore, we vary these hyper-parameters
and report the speedup ratios in Table 9 to find a better trade-off.

the MT-bench dataset with temperature T ∈ {0,1}, where HASS-MG denotes HASS trained with
self-distillation. L2 represents LLaMA2-Chat.
When ‘depth’ = 5, the acceptance length is relatively small. When ‘depth’ = 9, the verification
overhead is extremely high. Thus, neither of these settings achieves a promising speedup ratio. For
both HASS-MG and EAGLE-2, the best performances are achieved when ‘depth’ ∈ {6,7,8}and
‘# tokens’ ∈ {60,80,100}. HASS-MG consistently obtains a superior performance compared with
EAGLE-2 through hyper-parameter tuning across different LLMs and temperatures.

A.6 N UMBER OF TRAINING TOKENS
Inspired by Yi et al. (2024), we randomly sample different proportions of the training dataset, i.e.,
the ShareGPT dataset with 68,000 dialogues, to investigate the influences of training token numbers.
In specific, we train the draft models of HASS and EAGLE-2 with 1/8,1/4,1/2and the entire
ShareGPT dataset and summarize the results in Figure 8 and Table 10.

Figure 8: Acceptance lengths τand speedup ratios of HASS and EAGLE-2 averaging across MT-
bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K with different proportions of training dataset, i.e., the ShareGPT
dataset with 68,000 dialogues.
As shown from Figure 8, HASS consistently outperforms EAGLE-2 under different proportions
of training dataset with temperature T ∈ {0,1}.HASS with merely 1/4training dataset achieves
better or comparable performance compared to EAGLE-2 with the entire training dataset, which
demonstrates HASS’s superior data exploitation and scalability obtained through further aligning on
objectives and contexts between training and decoding. The speedup ratio and acceptance length of
HASS and EAGLE-2 are approximately logarithmically proportional to the scale of training data,
which is consistent with the finding in Yi et al. (2024). As shown from Table 10, the decrease in
training data contributes to more severe degradation on EAGLE-2 than that on HASS, reflecting
HASS’s robustness to data sparsity.

A.7 E VALUATION ON TRANSLATION TASKS
To investigate the robustness of HASS across different task types, we further evaluate HASS and
EAGLE-2 on five translation tasks3by following Yi et al. (2024). It is noted that both HASS and
EAGLE-2 are trained on the fixed ShareGPT dataset without adaptation for translation tasks. We
conduct experiments on LLaMA2-Chat 7/13B and LLaMA3-Instruct 8/70B and summarize the re-
sults in Table 11.

Table 11: Speedup ratios and acceptance lengths τof HASS and EAGLE-2 on five translation tasks,
where draft models are trained with the fixed ShareGPT dataset. De, Fr, Ja, Ru, Zh, and En stand for
German, French, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, and English, respectively. L2 represents LLaMA2-
Chat, while L3 represents LLaMA3-Instruct.
As shown from Table 11, HASS consistently outperforms EAGLE-2 under all settings. HASS
achieves 2.44x-3.28x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across five translation tasks, surpass-
ing EAGLE-2 by 17%-24%. In terms of acceptance length, HASS achieves 8%-14% improvement
over EAGLE-2. In consistent with results on dialogue (MT-bench), code generation (HumanEval),
and mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) tasks, HASS shows promising improvements over EAGLE-2
on translation tasks, reflecting its robustness across different task types.

A.8 T RAINING OVERHEAD
As shown from Table 4, training with 3/4 steps of harmonized context alignment generally obtains
the most considerable acceptance length, and so the aligning step of HASS is fixed to 3 (Standard)
in this paper unless stated otherwise. To investigate the actual training overhead of HASS, we train
draft models for LLaMA2-Chat 7/13B and LLaMA3-Instruct 8/70B on a single NVIDIA H800
GPU with batch size set to 2 and varied aligning steps, and summarize the results of training speed,
computational cost, and GPU memory in Figures 9, 10, and 11, respectively. It is worth mentioning
that the training overhead of HASS with 1 aligning step is the same as that of EAGLE-2.

Figure 9: Training speed (batch/s) of HASS with varied aligning steps, where the speed of Align-1
is the same as that of EAGLE/EAGLE-2.
The training speed is evaluated by how many batches can be processed in one second, i.e., batch/s,
and the ratio between Align-1 and Align- jrepresents how much training time needed for executing
the same amount of training data compared to EAGLE-2. As shown from Figure 9, the training speed
decreases with more aligning steps. However, the actual training time of standard HASS (Align-3) is
only 66.34% more than EAGLE-2 averaging over four target models, and the highest extra time cost
compared to EAGLE-2 is just 91.47% (on LLaMA3-Instruct 8B). The training overhead of HASS
is totally affordable, while HASS achieves superior performance and requires unchanged inference
overhead.

Figure 10: Training FLOPs of HASS with varied aligning steps, where the computational cost of
Align-1 is the same as that of EAGLE/EAGLE-2. The upper figures show the FLOPs of the forward
pass, while the lower figures show the FLOPs in total (forward and backward passes).
The computational cost is evaluated by TFLOPs and can be divided into forward pass and backward
pass, we depict the cost of forward and backward passes in upper and lower figures in Figure 10,
respectively. The cost of forward pass is consisted of three parts:
• Constant part is invariant to the number of aligning steps. Mapping target LLM’s hidden
state into q(x)(refer to section 3.1) with the LM head for distilling the draft model is
included in constant part.

• Attention part is linearly proportional to the hidden state number fed into the draft model,
which is accumulated across HASS training steps, i.e.,Pj
i=1ifor Align- j. Fusing token
embeddings with hidden states, projecting hidden states into keys and values, and conduct-
ing attention operations between query and several kv-pairs sourced from different hidden
states are included in attention part.
• Others is linearly proportional to the number of aligning steps, i.e., jfor Align- j. Compu-
tational costs except for constant and attention parts are included in others.
The cost of backward pass can be considered as (A+O)×2, where AandOrepresent attention
part and others respectively, as the computation of constant part requires no gradient. Generally, the
standard HASS (Align-3) requires approximately 3x computational cost of EAGLE-2.

Figure 11: Training GPU memory of HASS with varied aligning steps, where the GPU memory of
Align-1 is the same as that of EAGLE/EAGLE-2. Avg and Peak stand for the average and peak GPU
memory across the training process, respectively.
The GPU memory is evaluated by GB and we report the average and peak GPU memory across
the training process. Both the average and peak GPU memory increase with more aligning steps.
The GPU memory requirement can be covered by a single NVIDIA H800 GPU even at Align-5 and
batch size set to 2.
