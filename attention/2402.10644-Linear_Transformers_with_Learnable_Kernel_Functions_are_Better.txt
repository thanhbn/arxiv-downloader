1 Introduction
LargeLanguageModels(LLMs)arerevolutioniz-

(Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). Neverthe-
less,despitetheirtriumphs,mostofthesemodels
arebuiltonTransformerframeworksthatemploy
attention mechanisms. These mechanisms scale
poorly with long text sequences, leading to im-
practicalcomputationalcomplexityforextending
contextual processing (Vaswani et al., 2017; Tay
et al., 2021).
To address this constraint, several alternatives
to Transformers were proposed. Katharopoulos
et al. (2020) suggested replacing the exponential

vanilla Transformers, this approach leads to a drop
inperformance. Furthermore,thekernelfunction
selection is a topic still in need of consideration.
An alternative way to define a linear model is to
utilizeStateSpaceModels(SSMs)(Guetal.,2022;
Smithetal.,2023;GuandDao,2023),whichare
capable ofproducing quality that iscomparable to
Transformers when measured with perplexity on
language modeling.
Notably,bothLinearTransformersKatharopou-
los et al. (2020) and SSMs can be described as
RecurrentNeural Networks(RNNs)(Chunget al.,
2014;HochreiterandSchmidhuber,1997),which
havetheirlimitationswhenitcomestomanaging
lengthy dependencies within texts since memory
capacitycanbeoverrunasthevolumeofinforma-
tion increases. Additionally, while the hidden state
of RNNs is larger for Linear Transformers than for
SSMs, the latter showed higher text modeling qual-
ity. The introduction of the Based model (Arora
et al., 2024) attempted to address the abovemen-
tioned challenges by utilizing a hybrid architecture
(Fu et al., 2023a) based on a Linear Transformer
with a novel kernel function derived from a Taylor
expansionofanexponentialfunction. Aroraetal.
(2024)demonstratedthattheBasedmodelwasless

Nonetheless, even the Based model experiences

2 Recent Work
The Vanilla Transformer architecture (Vaswani
etal.,2017),althoughwidelyusedinNLP(Radford
etal.,2019;Touvronetal.,2023;Devlinetal.,2019;
Jiangetal.,2023),suffersfromgrowingcomputa-
tionalandmemorydemands( O(𝑑∗𝑁2)assequence
lengths (𝑁) and head size ( 𝑑) increase). While this
is not much of a problem when it comes to shorter
sequences,itbecomesasignificantbottleneckwhen
working with longer ones.
Severalalternativearchitectureswereproposed
to address this issue. Katharopoulos et al. (2020)
suggested substituting the attention mechanism’s
exponentialfunction,whichismeanttomeasurethe
similaritybetweenqueriesandkeys,withaproductofkernelfunctionsthatcanbeseparatelyevaluated
forqueriesandkeys. Thiskernel-basedapproach
reshapesthecomputationwithintheattentionmech-
anism, cutting the time and memory complexity to
O(𝑑2∗𝑁). Additionally,duringinference,itsup-
ports sampling sequences with linear complexity
regarding length, similar to RNNs (Hochreiter and
Schmidhuber, 1997; Chung et al., 2014).
In a different approach, State Space Models
(SSMs)borrowfromcontroltheorytoofferasimpli-
fied structure akin to RNNs, but without activation
functions across time (Gu et al., 2022; Smith et al.,
2023; Gu et al., 2023). The Mamba model, also
knownasS6(GuandDao,2023),standsoutinthis
category, displaying enhanced learning of short-
term dependencies in texts compared to existing
pre-trainedLLMs(Jiangetal.,2023;Touvronetal.,
2023).
Despitetheseadvancements,thereisnostandard
way to fully evaluate these innovative architectures
to assess their performance limits. One standard
evaluation method is to pre-train a language model
and assess its perplexity with a given dataset, but
this may not truly reflect the model’s ability to
managelongcontextdependencies. Anotheroption
is to use the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark,
whichinvolvesclassification taskswithlong input
sequences. Though some new models have outper-
formedTransformersintheLRA,itisbelievedthat
thebenchmarkiscapableofintroducingbiasinthe
comparison (Amos et al., 2023).
One promising evaluation approach is to test an
architecture’sIn-ContextLearningabilities. Olsson
et al. (2022) introduced the concept of Associative
Recall (AR), a task where the model learns to copy
atokenfromasequenceafteracertainpoint. How-
ever,whileinFuetal.(2023a)theassociativerecall
taskwasimplementedwithagoaltoretrieveonly
one token, Arora et al. (2023) noted that this task

--- PAGE 3 ---
couldbeconsideredoverlysimplistic. Thisledto
the creation of the Multi-Query Associative Recall
(MQAR) task, which requires retrieving multiple
tokens from the context. Findings on MQAR in-
dicate thatwhile newer modelsmaycompete with
Transformer in terms of perplexity, they can still
struggle with long contexts at small model sizes
because oftheirlimited In-ContextLearning capa-
bilities. Meanwhile, Transformers remain robust
against such factors. Lastly, Arora et al. (2024)
introducedLinearTransformerwithanewkernel
function(namelyBased),showcasingenhancedper-
formance on the MQAR task when compared to
Mamba.
Despite this improvement, compared to tradi-
tional Transformers, the problem of decline in
performance when handling long sequences with
smaller models still remains. Addressing this chal-
lenge is the primary goal of our paper.
3 Background
3.1 Linear Transformers
To fully grasp the Based architecture, it is vital
to first discuss the original Transformer model.
The attention mechanism, which is central to the
Transformer’s functionality, evaluates the output 𝑦𝑖
for each position 𝑖as follows
𝑦𝑖=Í𝑖
𝑗=0sim(𝑄𝑖,𝐾𝑗)𝑉𝑗
Í𝑖
𝑛=0sim(𝑄𝑖,𝐾𝑛),
where the term sim(𝑄𝑖,𝐾𝑗)=exp𝑄𝑇

resentsthe similarity betweenthe query 𝑄𝑖andthe
key𝐾𝑗usinganexponentialfunction. Despiteits
effectiveness, the original Transformer’s reliance
onthisattentionmechanismincursaquadraticin-
crease in both computational time and memory
useasthesequencelengthgrows,whichbecomes
impractical for processing long sequences.
To address this scalability problem, Katharopou-
los et al. (2020) suggested replacing the direct
computation of similarity between 𝑄and𝐾with a
transformationthroughanon-linearkernelfunction
𝜙(·). Thisallowsforthefollowingapproximation:
sim(𝑄𝑖,𝐾𝑗)≈𝜙𝑇(𝑄𝑖)𝜙(𝐾𝑗). By implementing
this kernel, the Linear Transformer computes 𝑦𝑖as
𝑦𝑖=Í𝑖
𝑗=0𝜙𝑇(𝑄𝑖)𝜙(𝐾𝑗)𝑉𝑗
Í𝑖
𝑛=0𝜙(𝑄𝑖)𝜙𝑇(𝐾𝑛).
By rearranging the operations, we can express
the computation as𝑦𝑖=𝜙𝑇(𝑄𝑖)Í𝑖
𝑗=0𝜙(𝐾𝑗)𝑉𝑇

𝑛=0𝜙(𝐾𝑛).
By calculating 𝜙(𝐾𝑗)𝑉𝑇

inefficiencies of the original model.
3.2 Based
Selecting an appropriate kernel function 𝜙(·)is
criticaltoaLinearTransformer’sperformance. Var-
ious kernel functions have been proposed (Peng
et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022),
but on language modeling tasks, none have sur-
passed the original attention mechanism. However,
abreakthroughwasachievedbyAroraetal.(2024),
who introduced a novel kernel function inspired
by the Taylor series expansion of the exponential
function, defined as
sim(𝑞,𝑘)=1+𝑞𝑇𝑘+(𝑞𝑇𝑘)2
2.
The choice of this kernel is motivated by its
ability to approximate the exponential function
over a specific range of 𝑞𝑇𝑘values. In addition,
Arora et al. (2024) utilized a hybrid architecture
by combining linear attention with convolutional
layers since doing so was shown to help models
handle short non-associative dependencies in the
sequences (Fu et al., 2023a; Poli et al., 2023; Fu
et al., 2023b)
In doing so, when evaluated on the MQAR task,
the Based model demonstrated that it was capa-
ble of outperforming the Mamba model (Gu and
Dao, 2023) under circumstances of substantial con-
text length and constrained model capacity due
to smaller sizes. Nevertheless, compared to the
original Transformer, a discernible drop-off in per-
formanceremains,indicatingroomforfurtherim-
provement.
4 Revisiting Based
In our study, we explore the fundamental require-
mentsforkernelfunctions. Weexaminetheexpo-
nentialfunctionanditsapproximaterepresentation,
as depicted in Figure 2. We observe a limitation
in the approximation since its minimal value is
fixedat 0.5. Thisisproblematicforhandlinglong
sequences, as it is difficult to assign a near-zero
attentionscoretospecifictokenpairs. Ideally,we
want to be able to diminish the attention scores

values elsewhere in the normalization process with
the Based model.
To rectify this issue, a straightforward approach
would be to adjust the lowest point of the kernel
functiontozero. However,thissolutionpromptsus
toaskwhytheminimumvalueofthekernelfunc-
tionshouldoccurpreciselyat 𝑞𝑇𝑘=−1. Asusedin
theoriginalTransformer,thetraditionalexponential
similarityfunctionincreasesmonotonically,butthe
quadratic kernel has an optimal value to which it
decreases and then ascends from. Therefore, to de-
crease attention in the Transformer, one would aim
to minimize𝑞𝑇𝑘. In contrast, the ideal 𝑞𝑇𝑘should
be exactly−1for the Based method. Otherwise,
the attentionscore would increase. This condition
mayinduceless-than-idealtrainingoutcomesand
degrade the model’s accuracy.
These challengeslead usto conjecture thatif the
quadratickernelisusedtocalculatethesimilarity
between𝑞and𝑘,wemustconsidertherangeofpo-
tential𝑞𝑇𝑘valuesandcreateadjustableparameters
fortheparabolicfunctiontoalignwiththesevalues
during training. Simplifying for clarity, let us look
at a one-dimensional scenario. We can express
the trainable parameters of the kernel function in
relation to the affine transformation of 𝑞and𝑘as
such
𝑞′=𝛾𝑄·𝑞+𝛽𝑄, 𝑘′=𝛾𝐾·𝑘+𝛽𝐾;
sim(𝑞′,𝑘′)=𝜙𝑇(𝑞′)𝜙(𝑘′).Here,𝜙(·)representsaquadraticfunction. The
modelcanlearnanyquadraticfunctionwithadeter-
mined minimum value by adjusting its parameters.
We can, therefore, simplify the kernel function to
𝜙(𝑥)=𝑥2.
Incorporatingtheaffinetransformationintothe
kernel function, we obtain
𝜙(𝑞′)=(𝛾𝑄·𝑞+𝛽𝑄)2=𝛾2
𝑄𝑞2+2𝛾𝑄𝛽𝑄𝑞+𝛽2
𝑄,
𝜙(𝑘′)=(𝛾𝐾·𝑘+𝛽𝐾)2=𝛾2

𝐾.
where𝑞and𝑘have their unique parameters 𝛾𝑄,
𝛾𝐾,𝛽𝑄, and𝛽𝐾, enabling the model to learn any
quadratic function that is non-negative and has a
single real root.
Interestingly, our transformation resembles the
applicationofLayerNormalization(Baetal.,2016),
minus the normalization itself. We hypothesize
whether normalizing 𝑞and𝑘before the kernel
function could improve the model’s performance.
Our suspicion is confirmed when normalization

incorporates Layer Normalization.

5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental Setup
We applied the first evaluation of our ReBased
model on the MQAR task , for which we trained
a model to perform associative recall with varying
numbers of retrieved tokens. Arora et al. (2023)
suggested that for a comprehensive assessment,
models need to be tested across different sequence
lengths, model sizes, and number of query-key
pairstoberetrieved. However,thoseexperiments
were limited, only exploring sequence lengths up
to512. These constraints resulted in the Based
model displaying performance comparable to the
traditional attention mechanism.

ablation study to yield more precise insights, we
also employed smaller models with hidden sizes as
modest as[16,24,32,48].
In order to tailor our approach to varied se-
quences, we used different query-key (qk) pairs
for each length. The specifics of these configura-
tions are detailed in Appendix A.
We alsoput other sub-quadraticarchitectures to
thetest,includingMamba(SSMfamily)(Guand
Dao,2023),Hyena(thelongconvolutionsfamily)
(Poli et al., 2023), the vanilla attention method,
and RWKV (Peng et al., 2023). By comparing a
diverse range of models, our goal was to present a
well-roundedevaluationofhowourReBasedmodel
standsoutinthefield. ForBased,weutilizedTriton
kernelspublishedbyYangandZhang(2024),and
for ReBased, we modified it so that 𝜙(𝑥)=𝑥2.
Weusedahybridarchitecturewithshortconvolu-
tionandkernelsize3inthefirstlayer,andspecified
amixerinthesecond. Wefoundthatthissetupwas
more stable on longer sequence lengths, especially
when using an attention mixer. However, we did
not modify the Mamba model since convolutions
were already present inside the Mamba block. We
put the full results and model architecture details
in Appendix A.
Inlanguage modeling , our second experimen-
talsetupleveragedtheextensivePiledataset(Gao
et al., 2020) to train a language model (LM). Weopted for a sequence length of 4096, a slight in-
crease from the standard value while still ensuring
the replication of the architectural framework as
presentedbyAroraetal.(2024) 1. Notethatsome
hyperparameters such as model dimension and the
number of layers were set in order to match the
number of model parameters in the initial experi-
ment. Detailedmodelconfigurationcanbefound

The MQAR task provided insights into In-
Context Learning proficiencies across various ar-
chitectures, while the language modeling assess-
mentallowedustoappraiseshort-termdependency
modeling capacities. Beyond traditional perplexity
metrics on validation data, we also scrutinized the
Associative(AR)andNon-Associative(Non-AR)
variants of perplexity. Here, AR corresponds to to-
kenpositionsnecessitatingassociativerecall,while
Non-AR refers to other tokens. When tokens recur
within a text,the subsequent appearances are cate-
gorized as AR, highlighting the model’s capability
to recall from context.

This experiment highlights the significance of
utilizing more sophisticated setups, as the perfor-

attention alternatives like ReBased becomes partic-

Therefore, more consideration should be devoted
to configurations involving lengthy sequences to
leverage the full potential of such models.

To further explore the ability of the model to im-
prove results on real-world scenarios we validate
trainedBasedandReBasedmodelsonacommonfew-shot benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Har-
ness(Gaoetal.,2023)benchmarkandSuperGLUE
(Wang et al., 2019). Results are presented in Table

most of the tasks.
5.6 Analysis
In this section, we delve into the internal dynam-
ics of the ReBased model by examining attention
matrices, which are commonly used to elucidate
thedecision-makingofmodelsandtheflowofin-
formation between tokens. Notably, we can use
the parallel mode with both Based and ReBased
models to construct these matrices.
For our analysis, we employ the MQAR dataset
(Arora et al., 2023) and train a compact model
configured with a sequence length of 128 and 32
retrieval pairs. To ensure clear interpretation of the
attention maps, we used fixed weights in the first
layer,whichconsistsofashortconvolutionwitha

the training phase, we compute the Intersection

particularly vital and is implemented via focused
attentioninthesecondlayerofthenetwork(Olsson

6 Conclusion and Future Work
Inthis paper, wepresent ReBased, anovelarchitec-
ture for sub-quadratic attention computation. For
ourmodel,weanalyzedtheBasearchitectureand
proposedtodevelopitevenfurtherbyusingpolyno-
mial kernels with learnable parameters and adding
normalization before the kernel evaluation. While
incorporating layer normalization into model train-
ing was attempted previously (Henry et al., 2020),
our method integrates this normalization directly
into the kernel function. With this simple architec-
turalchange,weachievedresultsthatoutperformed
Based on MQAR and language modeling with the
Pile dataset tasks.
WeanalyzedtheinternalrepresentationsofRe-
Based, Based, and vanilla attentionmodules, and
concluded that ReBased resembles attention morethan Based. Notably, while Based uses a Taylor
expansion of an exponential function, a ReBased
kernelfunctionisdifferentfromtheexponentbut
shows better performance. Our research suggests
thatusingasecond-orderpolynomialmightbein-
sufficient for the best performance, and indicates
that more sophisticated learnable kernels could be
utilizedtoimprovetheperformanceoftrainedmod-
els. Normalizationcouldfurtherimprovevarious
kernel functions. This highlights a need for re-
searcherstorevisitkernel-basedmethodswiththe
goal of enhancing their adaptability and efficiency.
Our findings reveal a disparity in handling the
MQAR task between attention-based models and
others such as Based, specifically as sequence
lengths increase. Attention models excel on longer
sequences, significantly outperforming their non-
attentioncounterparts. Theseresultshighlightthe
necessity of further research into strategies that
could bridge this gap in order to reach the perfor-
mance of attention-based methods. Perhaps the
superior aspects of attention mechanisms could be
matchedorexceededbyothermodels,especiallyon
tasksthatrequireassociativerecall,suchasmachine
translation (Vardasbi et al., 2023). Future research
could give insight into this, leading to improved
models for processing long sequences.

7 Limitations
While our proposed method demonstrates applica-
bilitytoawiderangeoftaskstypicallyaddressed
by Transformers, its effectiveness in handling tasks
involving intensive copying or recalling previous
context remains unclear (see Table 2 and Jelassi
etal.(2024)). Successfullyaddressingthesetasks
is crucial for fully mitigating inference problems
associated with attention mechanisms.
Itisalsoworthnotingthatourexperimentsare
limitedtoacademic-scalemodels. Thisdoespose
certain limitations, particularly in extrapolating
the findings to larger models. However, given
the resource constraints, our results still provide
valuableinsightsintothepotentialefficacyofour
method.
