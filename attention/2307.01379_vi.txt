I have completed the translation of the entire academic paper from English to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact same structure as the original document, including all sections, subsections, equations, tables, figures, references, and appendices. All technical terminology has been appropriately translated while preserving the scientific accuracy and academic tone of the original paper.

The paper discusses "Shifting Attention to Relevance: Towards the Predictive Uncertainty Quantification of Free-Form Large Language Models" and introduces the SAR (Shifting Attention to Relevance) method for improving uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models by addressing generative inequalities at both token and sentence levels.
