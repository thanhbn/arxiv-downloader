Abstract
Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-
the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training
and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as
the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses O(n2)time and
space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the
self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further
exploit this ﬁnding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces
the overall self-attention complexity from O(n2)toO(n)in both time and space.
The resulting linear transformer, the Linformer , performs on par with standard
Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efﬁcient.
1 Introduction
Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) have become ubiquitous for wide variety of problems
in natural language processing (NLP), including translation (Ott et al., 2018), text classiﬁcation,
question answering, among others (Raffel et al., 2019; Mohamed et al., 2019). Over the last couple of
years, the number of parameters in state-of-the-art NLP transformers has grown drastically, from the
original 340 million introduced in BERT-Large to 175 billion in GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). Although
these large-scale models yield impressive results on wide variety of tasks, training and deploying
such model are slow in practice. For example, the original BERT-Large model (Devlin et al., 2019)
takes four days to train on 16 Cloud TPUs, and the recent GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) consumed
orders of magnitude more petaﬂops / day to train compared to its predecessor, GPT-2 (Radford et al.,
2019). Beyond training, deploying Transformer models to real world applications is also expensive,
usually requiring extensive distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) or compression.
The main efﬁciency bottleneck in Transformer models is its self-attention mechanism. Here, each
token’s representation is updated by attending to allother tokens in the previous layer. This operation
is key for retaining long-term information, giving Transformers the edge over recurrent models on
long sequences. However, attending to all tokens at each layer incurs a complexity of O(n2)with
respect to sequence length. Thus, in this paper, we seek to answer the question: can Transformer
models be optimized to avoid this quadratic operation, or is this operation required to maintain
strong performance?
Prior work has proposed several techniques for improving the efﬁciency of self-attention. One popular
technique is introducing sparsity into attention layers (Child et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019; Beltagy
et al., 2020) by having each token attend to only a subset of tokens in the whole sequence. This
reduces the overall complexity of the attention mechanism to O(npn)(Child et al., 2019). However,
as shown in Qiu et al. (2019), this approach suffers from a large performance drop with limited
efﬁciency gains, i.e., a 2% drop with only 20% speed up. More recently, the Reformer (Kitaev et al.,
2020) used locally-sensitive hashing (LSH) to reduce the self-attention complexity to O(nlog(n)).
However, in practice, the Reformer’s efﬁciency gains only appear on sequences with length >2048
(Figure 5 in Kitaev et al. (2020)). Furthermore, the Reformer’s multi-round hashing approach actually
increases the number of sequential operations, which further undermines their ﬁnal efﬁciency gains.

In this work, we introduce a novel approach for tackling the self-attention bottleneck in Transformers.
Our approach is inspired by the key observation that self-attention is low rank . More precisely, we
show both theoretically and empirically that the stochastic matrix formed by self-attention can be
approximated by a low-rank matrix. Empowered by this observation, we introduce a novel mechanism
that reduces self-attention to an O(n)operation in both space- and time-complexity: we decompose
the original scaled dot-product attention into multiple smaller attentions through linear projections,
such that the combination of these operations forms a low-rank factorization of the original attention.
A summary of runtimes for various Transformer architectures, including ours, can be found in Table 1.
One predominant application of Transformers, that has seen the most gains, is using them as pretrained
language models, whereby models are ﬁrst pretrained with a language modeling objective on a large
corpus, then ﬁnetuned on target tasks using supervised data (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019;
Lewis et al., 2019). Following Devlin et al. (2019), we pretrain our model on BookCorpus (Zhu
et al., 2015) plus English Wikipedia using masked-language-modeling objective. We observe similar
pretraining performance to the standard Transformer model. We then ﬁnetune our pretrained models
on three tasks from GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and one sentiment analysis task, IMDB reviews (Maas
et al., 2011). On these tasks, we ﬁnd that our model performs comparably, or even slightly better, than
the standard pretrained Transformer, while observing signiﬁcant training and inference speedups.

2 Backgrounds and Related works
2.1 Transformer and Self-Attention
The Transformer is built upon the idea of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA), which allows the model
to jointly attend to information at different positions from different representation subspaces. MHA
is deﬁned as
MultiHead (Q;K;V ) =Concat (head 1;head 2;:::; headh)WO; (1)
whereQ;K;V2Rndmare input embedding matrices, nis sequence length, dmis the embedding
dimension, and his the number of heads. Each head is deﬁned as:

the hidden dimensions of the projection subspaces. For the rest of this paper, we will not differentiate
betweendkanddvand just use d.
The self-attention deﬁned in (2) refers to a context mapping matrix P2Rnn. The Transformer
usesPto capture the input context for a given token, based on a combination of all tokens in the
sequence. However, computing Pis expensive. It requires multiplying two ndmatrices, which is
O(n2)in time and space complexity. This quadratic dependency on the sequence length has become
a bottleneck for Transformers.
2.2 Related works
There has been much prior literature on improving the efﬁciency of Transformers, especially the
self-attention bottleneck. The most common techniques for model efﬁciency that can be applied to
Transformers (some speciﬁc to Transformers, others more general-purpose) include:
2

--- PAGE 3 ---
Mixed Precision (Micikevicius et al., 2017): Using half-precision or mixed-precision representations
of ﬂoating points is popular in deep learning, and is also widely used in training Transformers (Ott
et al., 2019). This technique can be further improved through Quantization Aware Training (Jacob
et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2020), where the weights are quantized during training and the gradients are
approximated with the Straight-Through Estimator. This line of work is orthogonal to our approach,
and we use mixed-precision training by default.
Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015): Knowledge distillation aims to transfer the “knowl-
edge" from a large teacher model to a lightweight student model. The student model is then used
during inference. However this approach has drawbacks: It does not address speeding up the teacher
model during training, and moreover, student models usually suffer performance degradation com-
pared to the teacher model. For example, when distilling a 12-layer BERT to a 6-layer BERT, the
student model experiences an average 2.5% performance drop on several benchmark tasks (Sanh
et al., 2019).
Sparse Attention (Child et al., 2019): This technique improves the efﬁciency of self-attention by
adding sparsity in the context mapping matrix P. For example, the Sparse Transformer (Child et al.,
2019) only computes Pijaround the diagonal of matrix P(instead of the all Pij). Meanwhile,
blockwise self-attention (Qiu et al., 2019) divides Pinto multiple blocks and only computes Pij
within the selected blocks. However, these techniques also suffer a large performance degradation,
while having only limited additional speed-up, i.e., 2% drop with 20% speed up.
LSH Attention (Kitaev et al., 2020): Locally-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention utilizes a multi-round
hashing scheme when computing dot-product attention, which in theory reduces the self-attention
complexity to O(nlog(n)). However, in practice, their complexity term has a large constant 1282
and it is only more efﬁcient than the vanilla transformer when sequence length is extremely long.
Improving Optimizer Efﬁciency : Microbatching (Huang et al., 2019) splits a batch into small
microbatches (which can be ﬁt into memory), and then separately runs forward and backward passes
on them with gradient accumulation. Gradient checkpointing (Chen et al., 2016) saves memory
by only caching activations of a subset of layers. The uncached activations are recomputed during
backpropagation from the latest checkpoint. Both techniques trade off time for memory, and do not
speed up inference.
As we’ve noted, most common techniques have limitations in reducing both the training and inference
time/memory consumption, we investigate how to optimize the self-attention layers and introduce
our approach next.
3 Self-Attention is Low Rank
In this section, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism, i.e., the context mapping matrix P,
is low-rank.
We ﬁrst provide a spectrum analysis of the context mapping matrix P. We use two pretrained trans-
former models, RoBERTa-base (12-layer stacked transformer) and RoBERTa-large (24-layer stacked
transformer) (Liu et al., 2019) on two tasks: masked-language-modeling task on Wiki103 (Merity
et al., 2016) and classiﬁcation task on IMDB (Maas et al., 2011). In Figure 1 (left), we apply
singular value decomposition into Pacross different layers and different heads of the model, and
plot the normalized cumulative singular value averaged over 10k sentences. The results exhibit a
clear long-tail spectrum distribution across each layer, head and task. This implies that most of the
information of matrix Pcan be recovered from the ﬁrst few largest singular values. In Figure 1
(right), we plot a heatmap of the normalized cumulative singular value at the 128-th largest singular
value (out of 512). We observe that the spectrum distribution in higher layers is more skewed than in
lower layers, meaning that, in higher layers, more information is concentrated in the largest singular
values and the rank of Pis lower.
Below, we provide a theoretical analysis of the above spectrum results.

this approach requires performing an SVD decomposition in each self-attention matrix, which adds
additional complexity. Therefore, we propose another approach for low-rank approximation that
avoids this added complexity.

In Figure 2 (top right), we plot the inference speed of Linformer and standard Transformer versus
sequence length, while holding the total number of tokens ﬁxed. We see that while standard
Transformer becomes slower at longer sequence lengths, the Linformer speed remains relatively ﬂat
and is signiﬁcantly faster at long sequences.
Additional Efﬁciency Techniques Several additional techniques can be introduced on top of
Linformer to further optimize for both performance and efﬁciency:
Parameter sharing between projections: One can share parameters for the linear projection matri-
cesEi;Fiacross layers and heads. In particular, we experimented with 3 levels of sharing:
Headwise sharing: for each layer, we share two projection matrices EandFsuch that
Ei=EandFi=Facross all heads i.
Key-value sharing: we do headwise sharing, with the additional constraint of sharing the
key and value projections. For each layer, we create a single projection matrix Esuch that
Ei=Fi=Efor each key-value projection matrix across all head i.
Layerwise sharing: we use a single projection matrix Eacross all layers , for all heads, and
for both key and value.
For example, in a 12-layer, 12-head stacked Transformer model, headwise sharing, key-value sharing
and layerwise sharing will introduce 24, 12, and 1 distinct linear projection matrices, respectively.
Nonuniform projected dimension: One can choose a different projected dimension kfor different
heads and layers. As shown in Figure 1 (right), the contextual mapping matrices in different heads
and layers have distinct spectrum distributions, and heads in higher layer tend towards a more skewed
distributed spectrum (lower rank). This implies one can choose a smaller projected dimension kfor
higher layers.
General projections: One can also choose different kinds of low-dimensional projection methods
instead of a simple linear projection. For example, one can choose mean/max pooling, or convolution
where the kernel and stride is set to n=k. The convolutional functions contain parameters that require
training.
5 Experiments
In this section, we present experimental results for the the techniques described above. We analyze
the techniques one-by-one and explore how they impact performance.
5.1 Pretraining Perplexities
We ﬁrst compare the pretraining performance of our proposed architecture against RoBERTa (Liu
et al., 2019), which is based on the Transformer. Following Devlin et al. (2019), we use BookCor-
pus (Zhu et al., 2015) plus English Wikipedia as our pretraining set (3300M words). All models are
pretrained with the masked-language-modeling (MLM) objective, and the training for all experiments
are parallelized across 64 Tesla V100 GPUs with 250k updates.
Effect of projected dimension: We experiment with various values for the projected dimension k.
(We use the same kacross all layers and heads of Linformer.) In the Figure 3(a) and (b), we plot the
validation perplexity curves for both the standard Transformer and the Linformer across different
k, for maximum sequence lengths n= 512 andn= 1024 . As expected, the Linformer performs
better as projected dimension kincreases. However, even at k= 128 forn= 512 andk= 256 for
n= 1024 , Linformer’s performance is already nearly on par with the original Transformer. Effect of
sharing projections: In Figure 3(c), we plot the validation perplexity curves for the three parameter
sharing strategies (headwise, key-value, and layerwise) with n= 512 . Note that when we use just
a single projection matrix (i.e. for layerwise sharing), the resulting Linformer model’s validation
perplexity almost matches that of the the non-shared model. This suggests that we can decrease the
number of additional parameters in our model, and consequently, it’s memory consumption, without
much detriment to performance.
Effect of longer sequences: We evaluate the effect of sequence length during Linformer pretraining.
In the Figure 3(d), we plot the validation perplexity for Linformer with n2f512;1024;2048;4096g,

holding projected dimension kﬁxed at 256. Note that as sequence length increases, even though our
projected dimension is ﬁxed, the ﬁnal perplexities after convergence remain about the same. This
further empirically supports our assertion that the Linformer is linear-time.

5.2 Downstream Results
Thus far, we have only examined the pretraining perplexities of our model. However, we wish to
show that our conclusions hold after ﬁnetuning on downstream tasks. We ﬁnetune our Linformer on
IMDB (Maas et al., 2011) and SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013) (sentiment classiﬁcation), as well as QNLI
(natural language inference) (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), and QQP (textual similarity) (Chen et al., 2018)
We do the same with RoBERTa, 12-layer BERT-base and 6-layer distilled BERT. All of our models,
including the Transformer baselines, were pretrained with the same objective, pretraining corpus, and
up to 250k updates (although our Linformer takes much less wall-clock time to get to 250k updates,
and was consequently trained for less time). Results are listed in Table 2.
7

--- PAGE 8 ---
We observe that the Linformer model ( n= 512;k= 128 ) has comparable downstream performance
to the RoBERTa model, and in fact even slightly outperforms it at k= 256 . Moreover, we note
that although the Linformer’s layerwise sharing strategy shares a single projection matrix across the
entire model, it actually exhibits the best accuracy result of all three parameter sharing strategies.
Furthermore, the Linformer pretrained with longer sequence length (n= 1024;k= 256) has similar
results to the one pretrained with shorter length (n= 512;k= 256) , this empirically supports the
notion that the performance of Linformer model is mainly determined by the projected dimension k
instead of the ratio n=k.
5.3 Inference-time Efﬁciency Results
In Table 3, we report the inference efﬁciencies of Linformer (with layerwise sharing) against a
standard Transformer. We benchmark both models’ inference speed and memory on a 16GB Tesla
V100 GPU card. We randomly generate data up to some sequence length nand perform a full forward
pass on a multiple batches. We also choose batch size based on the maximum batch size that can ﬁt
in memory, and our memory savings are computed based on this number.

From Table 3, we see that even with n= 512 andk= 128 , Linformer has 1:5faster inference time
and allows for a 1:7larger maximum batch size than the Transformer. As sequence length increases,
the inference-time speed-up and memory savings are even more dramatic. We also plot inference
times of both Linformer and Transformer on the 100 data samples in the top right of Figure 2.
6 Conclusion
Transformer models are notoriously slow to train and deploy in practice since their self-attention
operations have O(n2)time and space complexity with respect to sequence length n. In this paper,
we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that the stochastic matrix formed by self-attention
mechanism is low-rank. We further leverage this observation to propose a new, highly efﬁcient self-
attention mechanism. Through a combination of theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that our proposed approach is O(n)with respect to sequence length.
Broader Impact
Our work focuses on making Transformers more efﬁcient by introducing a mechanism that reduces
self-attention to linear-time complexity. Potential positive impacts of efﬁcient transformers include
increasing the accessibility of our models, both for deployment on devices, as well as during training
for research purposes. It also has potential impact on training transformer on images since we can
support very long sequences. Furthermore, there are positive environmental beneﬁts associated with
decreasing the power consumption of models. As such, we see no immediate negative ethical or
societal impacts of our work beyond what applies to other core building blocks of deep learning.

A Proof of Theorem 1
Proof. The main proof idea is based on the distributional Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma (Linden-
strauss, 1984) (JL, for short), the following version is from (Arriaga & Vempala, 2006).
Lemma 1. LetRbe anknmatrix, 1kn, with i.i.d. entries from N(0;1=k). For any
x;y2Rn, we have
Pr (kRxk(1 +)kxk)>1 e (2 3)k=4; (11)

Here we provide a constructive proof. Given any approximation error >0, deﬁne the following
matrix.

whereRbe anknmatrix, 1kn, with i.i.d. entries from N(0;1=k). Clearly the rank of
matrix ~Psatisiﬁes

We further show that, when k= log(n), we have that, for any column vector w2Rn,
Pr

This concludes the theorem. For any row vector u2Rnof matrixPand any column vector w2Rn

k= 5 log(n)=(2 3), then theorem follows.

B Proof of Theorem 2
Proof. DeﬁneE=RandF=e R, whereR2Rnkwith i.i.d. entries from N(0;1=k),is a
constant with = 1=2n. We will ﬁrst prove that for any row vector x2Rnof matrixQKTand
column vector y2Rnof matrixV,
Pr 
kexp(xET)FyT exp(x)yTkkexp(x)yTk

kexp(x)RTRy exp(x)yTk+o(kexp(x)kkyk)
(c)
kexp(x)kkyk+o(kexp(x)kkyk) (22)
The above, step (a) is based on the Cauchy inequality and JL Lemma in (11). The step (b) utilizes
the fact that exponential function is Lipchitz continuous in a compact region. Then we can choose a
small enough , i.e.,=(1=n)such that
kexp(xR) exp(x)Rk=o(kexp(x)k) (23)
The step (c) is based on the JL Lemma deﬁned in (12).
Applying the result in (21) to every row vector of matrix Aand every column vector of matrix V, one
can directly prove that, for any row vector Aiof matrixA,
Pr 
kexp(AiET)FV exp(Ai)Vkkexp(Ai)kkVk
>1 o(1); (24)
by settingk= 5 log(nd)=(2 3). This result does not utilize the low rank property of matrix A
(rank(A)=d) and the resultant khas a dependency on sequence length n. We will further prove the
choice ofkcan be constant and independent of sequence length n.
Based on the fact that rank( A)=d, we can ﬁnd a row submatrix As2R2ddof matrix exp(AET)FH
such that rank( As)=d. Applying the result in (21) to every row vector of matrix Asand every column
vector of matrix V, andk= 9 log(d)=(2 3), we can obtain that, for any row vector As
