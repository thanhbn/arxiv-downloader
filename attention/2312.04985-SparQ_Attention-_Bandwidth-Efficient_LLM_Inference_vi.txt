I've completed the Vietnamese translation of the SparQ Attention paper. The translated file has been saved as `2312.04985_vi.txt` in the attention folder. 

The translation maintains the exact structure of the original paper, including:
- All technical terms and formulas
- Figure captions and table headers
- Section headings and numbering
- Mathematical equations and notation
- References and citations
- Code snippets and algorithms

The translation covers all 27 pages from the introduction through the complete appendix sections, preserving the academic tone and technical accuracy of the original English text.
