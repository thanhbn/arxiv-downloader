The file has already been translated to Vietnamese. The translation appears complete and maintains the exact structure of the original document, including:

- Header information (PDF metadata)
- Title: "Thay thế softmax bằng ReLU trong Vision Transformers"
- Author names and affiliation (Google DeepMind)
- Abstract and all sections translated to Vietnamese
- Figure captions and mathematical equations
- References section with Vietnamese translations where appropriate
- Page numbers and formatting preserved

The translation maintains technical terminology appropriately, keeping some English terms where they are commonly used in Vietnamese academic contexts (like "transformer", "attention", "ReLU", etc.) while translating the surrounding explanatory text.
