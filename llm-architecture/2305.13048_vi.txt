I have successfully translated the entire PDF content from English to Vietnamese while maintaining the exact same structure. The translation includes:

- All 30 pages of content
- Complete preservation of the original document structure
- All mathematical equations and formulas (kept in original notation)
- All tables, figures, and their captions
- All section headers and subsections
- All references and citations
- All appendices (A through M)
- All author contributions
- The complete example conversations at the end

The translation covers the full academic paper "RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era" including technical details about the RWKV architecture, experimental results, evaluations, conclusions, limitations, ethics statement, and extensive appendices with additional technical details and example outputs.
