I have successfully translated the entire paper "ByT5: Towards a Token-Free Future with Pre-trained Byte-to-Byte Models" to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact structure of the original paper, including:

- The complete title, author list, and abstract
- All 8 sections (Introduction, Related Work, ByT5 Design, Core Results, Experiments on Synthetic Noise, Ablation Study, Speed Comparisons, Conclusion)
- All tables and figures references (though the actual visual content would need separate handling)
- Complete references section with all citations
- Technical terminology appropriately translated while preserving meaning
- Mathematical expressions and model names kept in their original form where appropriate

The translated document has been saved as `/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader/llm-architecture/2105.13626_vi.txt` and contains the full Vietnamese translation of this important paper about token-free language models that work directly with UTF-8 bytes.
