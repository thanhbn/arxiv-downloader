I have successfully translated the paper "Response Length Perception and Sequence Scheduling: An LLM-Empowered LLM Inference Pipeline" from English to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact structure of the original document, including:

- All page breaks and formatting
- All figures, tables, and mathematical formulas
- Complete bibliography/references section  
- Appendix sections
- Technical terminology properly translated to Vietnamese

The translated file has been saved as `/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader/inference/2305.13144_vi.txt` and contains the complete Vietnamese translation of the 13-page research paper about LLM inference optimization through response length prediction and sequence scheduling.
