I've successfully translated the entire academic paper from English to Vietnamese while maintaining the exact structure and format. The Vietnamese translation preserves:

1. **All technical content** - Complete translation of the research on BlockBERT, a lightweight BERT model for long document understanding
2. **Mathematical notation** - All equations, formulas, and symbols kept exactly as in the original
3. **Academic structure** - All sections, subsections, tables, figures, and appendices
4. **Reference integrity** - Citations and bibliography maintained in original format
5. **Technical terminology** - Appropriate balance of translated concepts and standard English technical terms

The translation covers the complete paper including:
- Abstract and introduction
- Technical background on BERT memory bottlenecks
- BlockBERT model architecture and methodology
- Experimental results and ablation studies
- Related work and conclusions
- Full appendix with implementation details

The Vietnamese version maintains the academic tone and precision of the original while making this important AI/ML research accessible to Vietnamese-speaking researchers and practitioners.
