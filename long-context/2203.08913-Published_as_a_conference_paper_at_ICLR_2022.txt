ABSTRACT
Language models typically need to be trained or ﬁnetuned in order to acquire
new knowledge, which involves updating their weights. We instead envision
language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time,
thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language
models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We
demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of
recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks
and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19),
code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance
steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On
benchmarks including code and mathematics, we ﬁnd that the model is capable of
making use of newly deﬁned functions and theorems during test time.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have led to remarkable progress in natural language process-
ing (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), mathematical reasoning (Polu & Sutskever, 2020; Wang
et al., 2020a; Rabe et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Hahn et al., 2021; Cobbe et al., 2021), and program
synthesis (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022). However, transformer performance
on many of these tasks is limited by the context length of attention, which is typically short. The
ability to attend to far-away tokens is important in many situations. In novels, characters and events
are referenced across multiple chapters. In source code, references to classes and functions may
occur quite far from the places in which they are deﬁned. In theorem proving, proofs make use of
previously deﬁned lemmas.
Attention over long sequences is also useful as a form of rapid learning. Facts and information
which are stored in the form of weight matrices must be slowly trained over hundreds of thousands
of training steps. By using attention, however, a model can simply memorize facts (e.g. function
deﬁnitions) by storing them as (key, value) pairs in long-term memory, and then retrieve those facts
later by creating a query that attends to them. In this case, attention acts as a form of information
retrieval, allowing the model to look up facts that it has seen previously.
We demonstrate that a simple and effective way to increase the size of the attention context is to use
approximate k-nearest-neighbor ( kNN) lookup, which is widely used in information retrieval. A
number of extremely scalable implementations of kNN lookup are available, such as ScaNN (Guo
et al., 2020) and Faiss (Johnson et al., 2021).
There are two things which distinguish our approach from previous work on long-range attention (c.f.
Section 2). First, unlike some other approaches, kNN lookup does not do averaging or summarization
of tokens at long distances, but retrieves exact values even from the distant context.
Second, gradients are not backpropagated into the external memory, which is critical to the scalability
of our technique. The keys and values are a function of model parameters, so attempting to backprop-
agate gradients into external memory would necessarily involve computing all of the keys and values
with the current model parameters on every training step. However, if the external memory is not
differentiable, then we can instead instead reuse keys and values that were previously computed on
prior training steps, which drastically reduces the amount of computation for large memories. With

our technique, we are easily able to scale external memory up to sequence lengths of 131k or 262k
tokens on a single TPU device, while maintaining a reasonable step time.
We show that model perplexity steadily improves with the size of external memory on a variety of
language modelling tasks, including C4 (long documents only), Github code repositories, PG-19
books, formal proofs in Isabelle, and arXiv math papers. We further show that models can generalize
to larger memory sizes than they were trained on: models trained with a small memory show gains
from using a much larger memory at inference time. Finally, we show that our models are actually
using memory in the way that we had hoped, e.g. by looking up the deﬁnitions of lemmas in a theorem
proving corpus.
The simplicity of the changes to the Transformer architecture allows us to easily integrate this
approach into existing code bases, including extremely large language models. We further show that
the improvements to quality are maintained across models of increasing size, and that the model
improvements gained from adding memory are even larger than increasing the size of the model by
5X or more as shown in Figure 1.
2 R ELATED WORK
A great deal of work has been done on efﬁcient long-range attention mechanisms; see Tay et al. (2020;
2021) recent surveys. Sliding windows (Beltagy et al., 2020) use a long sequence, but attend within
a smaller window, thus reducing complexity to the window size, rather than total sequence length.
Approximate mechanisms such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2020b), and Performer (Choromanski
et al., 2021) refactor the attention matrix by using a different kernel than softmax to obtain O(N)
complexity. Pooling strategies such as Hierarchical 1D attention (Zhu & Soricut, 2021), and Combiner
(Ren et al., 2021) apply pooling or averaging over tokens at longer distances. Sparse strategies such as
Big Bird (Zaheer et al., 2020) select only a subset of tokens to attend to; Routing Transformers (Roy
et al., 2021) use clustering to select the subset, while Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) relies on hashing.
Hierarchical mechanisms (Ainslie et al., 2020) combine multiple tokens into phrases or sentences to
reduce sequence length. Expire-span (Sukhbaatar et al., 2021) prunes far-away tokens that it learns
are “unimportant”. (Zemlyanskiy et al., 2021) process long sequences in two passes with different
encoders. The second pass is given a lot of context by accessing summaries of the ﬁrst pass.
Feedback transformers (Fan et al., 2020) use a recurrent architecture in which each token attends to
the output of the ﬁnal layer instead of the previous layer. Recurrence does not increase the size of the
attention context itself, but it expands the receptive ﬁeld at the cost of parallelism and training speed.
Truncated backpropagation through time (Williams & Peng, 1990) was originally introduced as a
way of training recurrent neural networks (RNN) over very long sequences, when the entire sequence
does not ﬁt in memory. The sequence is chopped into segments, and after each training step, the ﬁnal
RNN state for the segment is saved in a non-differentiable cache, and used as the initial state on the
next training step. Neural caches (Grave et al., 2017) extend the cache to contain a record of many
prior hidden states, and attend over them. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) applies this technique to
transformers; it caches the (key,value) pairs computed from the previous training step, and uses them
as a preﬁx for the tokens on the next training step, which yields signiﬁcant gains on long documents.
Rae et al. (2020) improve over Transformer-XL by compressing the tokens before adding them to the

cache. In contrast, we use a very large cache without compression, combined with an approximate
kNN attention mechanism over it.
Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) make the observation that the feed-forward portion of a transformer layer
functions very much like attention if one replaces the ReLU activation with softmax. They implement
a combined attention over both tokens from the input sequence and a learned (and differentiable)
“memory”. Lample et al. (2019) exploit this observation to replace the feed-forward layers (FFNs)
with a fastkNN lookup over a much larger “memory”, and achieve large gains in model accuracy
without signiﬁcant computation overhead. (We use kNN lookup to approximate attention to previous
tokens, not to replace the FFN.)
Non-differentiable external memory has been used in different ways by Khandelwal et al. (2020), who
run a pre-trained model over an entire corpus, and construct a large table of (key, token) pairs. They
then use that table to replace the ﬁnal softmax layer for token selection in the model, which results in
signiﬁcant improvements in language modeling. Yogatama et al. (2021) extend this approach by a
gating mechanism and a process to compress the context into keys for retrieval.
There are several works that combine retrieval with transformers. REALM (Guu et al., 2020),
MARGE (Lewis et al., 2020a), RAG (Lewis et al., 2020b), and composite memory for dialog (Fan
et al., 2021) retrieve documents from a knowledge base to improve question answering or dialogue.
The knowledge base consists of text snippets and is static and typically separate from the inputs and
outputs of the models. Instead, we focus on language modeling using a decoder-only model, and
propose a simple model that uniﬁes attention and retrieval .
k-nearest-neighbor lookup is a general-purpose technique that is used for a wide variety of machine
learning and retrieval tasks, and high-performance implementations are available for various architec-
tures (Johnson et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2020). Memory-efﬁcient Transformers (Gupta et al., 2021)
replace dense attention with a kNN lookup to increase speed and reduce memory usage.
3 M ETHOD
The architecture of our kNN-augmented transformer is shown in Figure 2. The bulk of the model is a
vanilla, decoder-only transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). The input text is tokenized, and the tokens
are embedded into vector space. The embedding vectors are passed through a series of transformer
layers, each of which does dense self-attention, followed by a feed-forward network (FFN). Since
this is a decoder-only language model, we use a causal attention mask and the token embeddings of
the last layer are used to predict the next token.
Long documents are split into subsequences of 512 tokens, and each subsequence is used as the input
for one training step. In contrast to standard practice, we do not shufﬂe the subsequences; instead,
each long document is fed into the transformer sequentially, from beginning to end, as is done with
Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019).

Figure 3: Our data pipeline splits documents into subsequences and packs subsequences into batches.
We also use a Transformer-XL style cache, which holds the keys and values from the previous training
step. When doing self-attention, the cached keys and values are prepended to the current keys and
values, and we use a sliding-window causal mask (Beltagy et al., 2020) so that each token has a local
context that includes the previous 512 tokens.
3.1kNN- AUGMENTED ATTENTION LAYER
One of the transformer layers near the top of the stack is a kNN-augmented attention layer , which
combines two forms of attention. Like all of the other layers, it uses standard dense self-attention on
thelocal context , which is the input subsequence for the current training step. Unlike the other layers,
however, it also does an approximate k-nearest-neighbor search into the external memory .
The same queries are used for both the local context, and for the external memory. The keys and
values also belong to the same distribution; after each training step, the (key, value) pairs in the local
context are appended to the end of the external memory. If the document is very long, old (key, value)
pairs will be dropped from the memory to make room for new ones. Thus, for each head, the external
memory keeps a cache of the prior M(key, value) pairs, where Mis the memory size.
ThekNN lookup will return a set of retrieved memories , which consist of the top- k(key, value) pairs
thatkNN search returns for each query (i.e. each token) in the input subsequence. As with standard
dense attention, we ﬁrst construct an attention matrix by computing the dot product of each query
against the retrieved keys, then apply softmax, and ﬁnally return a weighted sum of the retrieved
values. Unlike standard dense attention, the retrieved memories contain a different set of (key, value)
pairs for each query.
Attention over the local context is performed in the usual way. The results of kNN-attention and local
attention are then combined using a learned gate:
g=(bg) (1)
Va=Vmg+Vc(1 g) (2)
whereis the sigmoid function, and is element-wise multiplication. Vais the combined result of
attention, Vmis the result of attending to external memory, and Vcis the result of attending to the
local context. The biasbgis a learned per-head scalar parameter, which allows each head to choose
between local and long-range attention. In our experiments, the value of the gate gdoes not depend
on the content of the token at each position, although that would be a trivial extension to implement.
We did observe that over time, most heads learned to attend almost exclusively to external memory.
Position bias. For dense attention within the local context, we use the T5 relative position bias (Raffel
et al., 2020). As noted by Dai et al. (2019), adding a global position encoding to each token does not
work well when processing long documents. We don’t use a position bias for the retrieved memories.
Experiments on the PG19 dataset (Sun et al., 2021) have shown that relative position does not appear
to matter at long range, and the T5 relative bias puts all long-range tokens in the same bucket anyway.
Batching. Figure 3 illustrates how multiple long documents of different lengths are packed into a
batch, and split into subsequences. Each subsequence in the batch comes from a different document,
and thus requires a separate external memory, which is cleared at the start of each new document.
3.2 D ISTRIBUTIONAL SHIFT
Because each long document is processed over multiple training steps, there is a distributional shift
in the keys and values that are stored in external memory. The model parameters that produce the
queries change over time, and will thus have shifted since the keys and values were stored. For
very large memories, older records may become “stale.” Similar observations have been made for
CrossBatch memory (Wang et al., 2020c) in the vision domain.
4

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
To reduce the effects of staleness, we normalize keys and queries (Henry et al., 2020). Normalization
does not eliminate staleness, but it at least ensures that older keys and newer keys do not differ in
magnitude. We also found that normalization helps stabilize training with the Transformer-XL cache.
In some of our experiments, we observed that training models from scratch with a large memory
sometimes resulted in worse performance than pretraining the model with a small memory of size
8192, and then ﬁnetuning it on a larger memory. This training instability could be due to staleness.
However, models seem to be able to cope with a limited degree of staleness (with the small memory)
by adjusting their queries accordingly.
3.3 A PPROXIMATE kNN
We employ approximate kNN search rather than exact kNN search because it signiﬁcantly improves
the computational speed of our model. We use a simple approximation of kNN for TPUs, which has
a recall of about 90%, i.e. 90% of the true top kare returned in the approximate top k. There are
various other efﬁcient approximate kNN algorithms available for CPU and GPU/TPU, for example
through Faiss (Johnson et al., 2021) or ScaNN (Guo et al., 2020), which can scale into the billions.
4 E XPERIMENTS
We evaluate the effect of adding external memory on ﬁve language modeling tasks, all of which
involve long-form text: English language books (PG-19), long web articles (C4), technical math
papers (arXiv Math), source code (Github), and formal theorems (Isabelle). The results show
signiﬁcant improvements in the perplexity of the model with the addition of external memory. We
experimented with various sizes of external memory, from 1536 to as high as 262K. On most of the
datasets, there was an initial sharp gain from adding a small external memory, followed by smaller
but steadily increasing gains as the size of the memory was increased.
4.1 D ATASETS
arXiv Math For the arXiv dataset, we collected a corpus of papers by downloading them via
the arXiv Bulk Data Access1. We ﬁltered papers to include only articles labeled as “Mathematics”
and whose L ATEX source was available. The number of tokens per paper in this dataset is roughly
comparable to the number of tokens per book in PG19, because L ATEX source has many special
characters and the tokenizer tends to output small subwords.
Github We used BigQuery2to obtain a large corpus of Github repositories that are published with
open-source licenses. We used ﬁle endings to ﬁlter for ﬁles in the languages C, C++, Java, Python
(including Jupyter notebooks), Go, and TypeScript. Individual source code ﬁles are often fairly short,
and there are many dependencies and cross-references between ﬁles in the repository. To capture
these dependencies, we created one long document for each Github repository by traversing the
directory tree, and concatenating all of the ﬁles within it. The order in which ﬁles are traversed within
the repository is random, but each subdirectory is processed as a unit, so that all the ﬁles within the
subdirectory are close to each other in the resulting document. Source code is usually structured
so that related ﬁles are all grouped together in the same subdirectory; this traversal preserves that
structure, while still shufﬂing ﬁles and subdirectories in random order.
Formal Math – Isabelle The Isabelle corpus consists of formal mathematical proofs of theories.
We collected all 627 theories available on The Archive of Formal Proofs3(as of October 6, 2021) and
an additional 57 theories from the Isabelle standard library4to create a corpus of 684 theories. All
theories have open-source licenses. Each theory is a self-contained mathematical object, on topics
such as foundational logic, advanced analysis, algebra, or cryptography, and consists of multiple
ﬁles containing proofs. As with the Github corpus, all ﬁles that make up a theory are concatenated

together into one long document. Unlike the Github corpus, we order the ﬁles according to their
import dependencies, so that later ﬁles use sub-theorems that are proved in earlier ﬁles.
C4(4K +)C4, the colossal cleaned common crawl, is a very large collection of documents that have
been scraped from the internet (Raffel et al., 2020). We ﬁltered out all documents that have less than
4096 tokens to focus on documents where memory can have an impact.
PG-19 PG-19 is a large dataset of English-language books, published prior to 1919, which were
retrieved from the Project Gutenberg archive (Rae et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021). PG-19 is one of the
few public datasets that only contains full-length books, and has become a benchmark for long-range
natural language text modeling.
4.2 E XPERIMENTAL METHOD
We used a 12-layer decoder-only transformer (with and without Transformer-XL cache) with an
embedding size of 1024, 8 attention heads of dimension 128, and an FFN hidden layer of size 4096.
For all of our experiments, we used k= 32 . Unless speciﬁed otherwise, we use the 9th layer as the
kNN augmented attention layer. We used a sentence-piece (Kudo & Richardson, 2018) tokenizer
with a vocabulary size of 32K.
We used the Adafactor optimizer (Shazeer & Stern, 2018). In preliminary experiments, we conducted
a hyperparameter search to determine the optimal learning rate among three choices ( f3:0,1:0,
310 1g), and found that 1:0works best. We used a linear warmup schedule for the ﬁrst 1000
steps, followed by square root decay. We trained the models from scratch for 500K steps on all the
datasets, except for the Isabelle dataset. Isabelle is small, so we stopped training after 100K steps
when the model began to overﬁt. We ran all of our experiments on 32 TPU cores. Our models were
implemented in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018) and Flax (Heek et al., 2020).
When comparing models with different context lengths, we adjusted the batch size (the number of
documents in a batch) so that there are always 217tokens in a batch. E.g., a model with a context
length of 512 has a batch size of 256, while the 2048 model has a batch size of 64.
We experimented with multiple implementations of approximate kNN lookup with different tradeoffs
between quality and computational cost. We did not observe a signiﬁcant degradation of the model
quality when switching to lower quality approximations of kNN, so the model appears to be quite
robust with respect to the quality of kNN retrieval. For a model with around 200M trainable
parameters the step time increased from 0.2s to 0.25s when we added a memory of size 8K, and to
0.6s when we added a memory of size 65K (measured on TPUv3).
4.3 E FFECT OF EXTERNAL MEMORY
Adding external memory results in substantial gains across datasets and architectures, as
shown in Table 4. Across all ﬁve datasets, adding external memory to either the vanilla Transformer
or the Transformer-XL architecture improves perplexity by a substantial amount. For example, on

C4(4K+) dataset, adding memory of size 8192 improves the perplexity of the vanilla Transformer
(with context size 512) from 17.20 to 14.42, and improves Transformer-XL from 15.38 to 14.04.
Increasing the size of the memory increases the beneﬁt of the memory. The best perplexities
for all datasets and architectures were obtained with a memory size of 65K.
Note that Transformer-XL with context size 2048 already has a theoretical receptive ﬁeld that is quite
large. Each token in a higher layer can attend up to 2048 tokens away in the layer below, so the total
receptive ﬁeld is 204812(layers)25K. Nevertheless, we still saw a substantial gain when adding
an external memory of size 8192 to this model. kNN attention into memory would appear to be a
more effective way to retrieve information from the distant past than the Transformer-XL cache.
On the other hand, we also saw improvements by adding XL cache to the large-memory (65K) models.
In a vanilla (non-XL) Transformer, the ﬁrst few tokens in a sequence have very little context, and
thus have higher perplexity. The XL cache provides additional local short-range context at the start of
a sequence, which complements the long-range context provided by external memory.
Interestingly, in a vanilla Transformer, using even a small external memory of size 1536 provides
a gain in perplexity which is almost as good as using a local context of size 2048 but no memory
(e.g. Table 4). This is surprising, because the external memory is not differentiable, and is added only
to one layer of the Transformer, whereas increasing the context size is differentiable and affects all
layers. We conclude that the lower layers of a Transformer don’t necessarily need long-range context,
and having a differentiable memory is not as important as one might suspect.
4.4 S CALING TO LARGER MODELS
We scaled up the Transformer model to sizes of 1and8billion parameters. For the 1 billion parameter
model, we use 8 layers, 32 heads with head dimension 128, d_model 2048, andd_ff16384. For the
8 billion parameter model, we use 64 heads, 16 layers, d_model 4096, andd_ff32768. We used a
context size of 2048, memory size of 8192, and no XL cache. We ran the comparisons to the vanilla
Transformer on the arXiv math dataset. Scaling plots are shown in Figure 1.
External memory provides a consistent improvement to the model as it is scaled up. Remarkably, we
found that the smaller Memorizing Transformer with just 8k tokens in memory can match the
perplexity of a larger vanilla Transformer which has 5X more trainable parameters.
4.5 F INETUNING ON LARGER MEMORIES
Finetuning on a larger memory. In some cases, training was unstable when using large memories,
possibly due to distributional shift early in the training (See Section 3.2). Thus, for memories of
131K or more tokens, we ﬁrst pretrain the model with a memory size of 8192 or 65K for 500K steps,
and then ﬁnetune it with the larger memory for an additional 20K steps. The results of ﬁnetuning on
the arXiv Math data set are shown in Table 5. Increasing the size of external memory provided
consistent gains up to a size of 262K. Note that 262K tokens is longer than almost all of the
documents in arXiv, and thus we would not expect to see any gain past this point (see Appendix A).

Finetuning a non-memory model to use memory Pretraining can be very costly both in time
and computational resources. Thus, a natural question to ask is: can one ﬁne-tune a pretrained
Transformer to use external memory? The answer is yes!
We took a pre-trained 1B vanilla Transformer model, and ﬁne-tuned it to use external memory (the
1B models used in Section 4.4). The ﬁne-tuning result is shown in Figure 6. Notice that the model
quickly learns to use external memory. Within 20K steps ( 4%of the pre-training time) the ﬁne-tuned
model has already closed 85% of the gap between it and the 1B Memorizing Transformer, and after
100k steps it has closed the gap entirely.
4.6 I NFORMATION RETRIEVAL PATTERNS
We conducted a qualitative study of what the model was actually retrieving from external memory,
by ﬁnding which tokens showed the biggest improvements in cross-entropy loss when the size of
the memory was increased, and then examining the top- kretrieved memories for those tokens. We
found that the model gained the most when looking up rare words, such as proper names, references,
citations, and function names, where the ﬁrst use of a name is too far away from subsequent uses to
ﬁt in the local context. This result is in keeping with the prior analysis of long-context Transformers
on PG19 (Sun et al., 2021), which found similar lookup patterns. For this experiment, we used a
slightly older version of the architecture without the gating mechanism.
Which tokens show a beneﬁt from memory? Figure 7 shows a visualization of which tokens
show an improvement when the size of the external memory is increased. We selected a math paper at
random, and plotted the difference in cross entropy loss for each token xiin the paper, comparing two
models with the same parameters, but with memories of different sizes. i=cross-entropy8192(xi)
 cross-entropy32K(xi). Positive values show an improvement in loss.
Thex-axis on the chart is the token number i, while they-axis is i. For the ﬁrst 8192 tokens, the
difference between the two models is zero, since the larger capacity of the 32K memory isn’t being
used yet. However, after token 8193 , we can see that the larger memory helps, on average, over the
smaller memory. The beneﬁt is not universal, since the predictions for some tokens become worse,
possibly due to the fact that a relevant retrieved memory no longer makes it into the top- kwhen the
size of the external memory is increased. This ﬁgure also shows that the beneﬁt of external memory
is somewhat sparse. The improvement in perplexity seems to be mainly driven by a small percentage
of tokens that obtain a large improvement in cross-entropy loss when using the larger memory.
What information is being looked up? Given that only a subset of tokens shows improvement
from external memory, we did a further investigation into what, exactly, those tokens are using the
memory for. We took those tokens which showed the largest improvement in cross-entropy loss, and
for each of them tokens, we examined the top- kretrieved memories. We studied arXiv math, Github
and Isabelle corpus. For arXiv math and Github, we found the model retrieved function and variable
names. See more details with examples in Appendix B.

Retrieving mathematical deﬁnitions. Our case study on the Isabelle corpus provides one of the
clearest illustrations of how a model can make good use of external memory. When predicting the
name of a mathematical object or a lemma, the model looked up the deﬁnition from earlier in the
proof. Examples of this behavior are shown in Table 8. In example 1, the model retrieves a deﬁnition
within the body of a lemma, markov_inequality . In example 2, it retrieves the deﬁnition of a
previously deﬁned concept subgraph_threshold . In example 3, it retrieves the deﬁnition of
orthonormal_system . We manually checked 10 examples where the model made a prediction
of lemma names, and 8 out of 10 times model found the body of the lemma it needs to predict. In
the other two cases, the model also looked up materials in the immediate vicinity. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst demonstration that attention is capable of looking up deﬁnitions and
function bodies from a large corpus. The Isabelle case study used a model with two memory layers
of size 32K.
5 C ONCLUSION
We present a simple extension to the Transformer architecture, called kNN-augmented attention,
which dramatically increases the length of the context that a language model can attend to by using
k-nearest-neighbor lookup into a large external memory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of external
memory in a series of language modeling experiments over a variety of long-document datasets,
including LaTeX documents, source code, formal proofs, and books.
The Memorizing Transformer shows large improvements in perplexity over the baseline for all of
the data sets and architectures that we studied; it is comparable to a vanilla transformer that has
5 times the number of parameters. Perplexity continues to improve with increasing memory size,
although there is a point of diminishing returns. Moreover, external memory continues to provide
beneﬁts even as the transformer is scaled up from 200M to 8B parameters. Perhaps most intriguingly,
a Memorizing Transformer does not need to be pre-trained from scratch; it is possible obtain large
gains from adding memory to an existing pre-trained model, and then ﬁne-tuning it.
Unlike other forms of attention, kNN retrieval can be easily scaled up to huge memory sizes, and is
thus potentially able to leverage vast knowledge bases or code repositories. How to make the best use
of this capability is a topic for future work.

ETHICS
The ability to memorize large databases of facts could have potential ramiﬁcations for society,
especially if those databases include sensitive personal information or copyrighted works. However,
one advantage of using an external memory is that the memory can be easily cleared of all such
information, as we do at the end of each document that we train on. The same is not true of
differentiable model parameters, which is what most existing architectures use to store facts and
information that they are trained on.
REPRODUCIBILITY
Details of our architecture and training hyperparameters are given in Section 4.2. The datasets
for C4 and PG-19 are publicly available. Our additional datasets, Github, Isabelle, and ArXiv
Math are derived from publicly available data buckets, which we link in the main part of the paper.
Subsection 4.1 include details on how we constructed the datasets from those datasets. We plan to
release our code as open source.

A.1 A BLATION STUDIES
In the following section, we performed ablation studies to investigate the effects of various hy-
perparameters. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we carried out these experiments with a memorizing
transformer with context size 512, XL cache 512 with a memory size of 8192.
MultiplekNN layers. We experimented with using two kNN layers, rather than just one. However,
we did not see further beneﬁts brought by more than multiple retrieval layers.
kNN layer index We experimented with adding the external memory to layer 3,6,9and12in a
12-layer transformer, with results shown in Table 14. We found that adding memory to the middle of
the layer stack will obtain the best result, whereas adding memory to layers either too close to the
input or to the output obtained less gains.
Table 14: Different layer index.
Layer index Perplexity
3 2.40
6 2.36
9 2.37
12 2.43
Number of neighbors We studied the effects of the number of neighbors we retrieve from memory,
with results shown in Table 15. We found that even with 32 number of neighbors, we can already
obtain a comparable results with 128 or 256 neighbors.
Table 15: Number of neighbors.

Random seeds We measured the statistical signiﬁcant of the results reported. We did 3 runs with
3 random seeds for Transformer XL of size 512, and also a memorizing transformer with memory
size 8192. We measured the standard deviation of perplexities after 500K steps of training, shown in
Table 16. We saw the standard deviation between different runs of the same experiment appears to be
much smaller than the gap between different models.

B W HAT DOES THE MODEL RETRIEVE FROM MEMORY ?
Retrieving citation names On arXiv math, several examples are shown in Table 17, which includes
both the retrieved token and its surrounding context. We observe that many of the gains in cross-
entropy loss took place when trying to predict the name of bibitems, citations, or references, by
looking up the references and citations used previously in the paper. Such lookups usually span over
the entire paper, which is much longer than 8192 tokens, providing a plausible explanation for the
gain beyond memory size of 8192.
Table 17: The table shows several examples of which tokens were retrieved during language modelling of arXiv
math dataset. The model is retrieving names of the references from previous passages.

Retrieving function names from the codebase As with the arXiv papers, we also studied which
tokens the model retrieved from memory. As might be expected, the model is often looking up the
names of functions, and variables, as shown in Table 18.
