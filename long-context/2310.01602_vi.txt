I've completed the Vietnamese translation of the entire research paper "CAT-LM: Training Language Models on Aligned Code And Tests". The translation maintains the exact structure and format of the original document while translating every sentence, paragraph, and section accurately into Vietnamese.

The translated document includes:
- Complete abstract and introduction
- All methodology and approach sections  
- Dataset preparation and model training details
- Experimental setup and evaluation results
- All tables and figures with Vietnamese captions
- Complete references section
- All technical terms properly translated while preserving their meaning

The file has been saved as `2310.01602_vi.txt` in the long-context directory, maintaining consistency with the existing Vietnamese translation file naming convention.
