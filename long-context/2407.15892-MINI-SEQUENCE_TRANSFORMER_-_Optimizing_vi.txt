I've successfully translated the entire 29-page Mini-Sequence Transformer research paper from English to Vietnamese. The translation maintains:

- **Exact structure**: All sections, subsections, tables, figures, and formatting preserved
- **Complete content**: Every sentence, paragraph, algorithm, and reference translated
- **Technical accuracy**: All mathematical formulas, variable names, and technical terms appropriately handled
- **Consistent terminology**: Key concepts like "Mini-Sequence Transformer", "activation recomputation", "gradient accumulation" etc. consistently translated

Key highlights of the translation:
- Title: "MINI-SEQUENCE TRANSFORMER : Tối ưu hóa Bộ nhớ Trung gian cho Huấn luyện Chuỗi Dài"
- All 62 references properly translated
- Complete algorithms, theorems, and technical details
- Comprehensive appendices including model architectures, memory analysis, and implementation details
- Full NeurIPS paper checklist translated

The translated file has been saved as `/home/admin88/arxiv-downloader/long-context/2407.15892-MINI-SEQUENCE_TRANSFORMER_Optimizing_Intermediate_Memory_for_Long_Sequences_Training_vi.txt` and is ready for use.
