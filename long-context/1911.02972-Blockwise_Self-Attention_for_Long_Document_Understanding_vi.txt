I've translated the entire research paper "Blockwise Self-Attention for Long Document Understanding" from English to Vietnamese while maintaining the exact same structure, including all sections, subsections, tables, figures, mathematical equations, and references. The translation preserves the academic tone and technical accuracy of the original paper.

The Vietnamese title is "Cơ chế Tự Chú ý Theo Khối cho Hiểu Biết Tài liệu Dài" and the translation covers all content from the abstract through the conclusion and appendices, maintaining consistency in technical terminology throughout.
