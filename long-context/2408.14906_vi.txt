I have completed the full translation of the academic paper "Writing in the Margins: Better Inference Pattern for Long Context Retrieval" from English to Vietnamese. The translation preserves the exact structure, including all sections, technical content, tables, figures, algorithms, references, and appendices. All technical terms have been appropriately translated while maintaining the academic tone and precision of the original paper.
