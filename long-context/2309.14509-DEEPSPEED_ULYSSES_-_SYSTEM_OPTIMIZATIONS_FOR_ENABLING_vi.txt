Done. I've translated the entire PDF content to Vietnamese, maintaining the exact structure and formatting including:
- Title and abstract
- All section headings and subsections
- All paragraph content
- Table structures and content
- Figure captions
- References

The translation is saved as `2309.14509_vi.txt` in the `long-context` directory.
