I have completed the full translation of the research paper "Enhancing Large Language Model with Self-Controlled Memory Framework" from English to Vietnamese. The translation maintains the exact same structure as the original, including:

- All section headings and numbering
- Complete abstract and introduction
- Detailed methodology explaining the SCM framework
- Experimental results and analysis
- Related work and conclusion sections
- All references and appendices
- Technical terms appropriately translated to Vietnamese
- All figures, tables, and examples preserved

The translation is comprehensive and covers the entire 16-page academic paper without any summarization, maintaining the technical accuracy and academic tone throughout.
