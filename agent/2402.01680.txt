Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved re-
markable success across a wide array of tasks.
Due to the impressive planning and reasoning abil-
ities of LLMs, they have been used as autonomous
agents to do many tasks automatically. Recently,
based on the development of using one LLM as a
single planning or decision-making agent, LLM-
based multi-agent systems have achieved consid-
erable progress in complex problem-solving and
world simulation. To provide the community with
an overview of this dynamic field, we present this
survey to offer an in-depth discussion on the essen-
tial aspects of multi-agent systems based on LLMs,
as well as the challenges. Our goal is for readers to
gain substantial insights on the following questions:
What domains and environments do LLM-based
multi-agents simulate? How are these agents pro-
filed and how do they communicate? What mech-
anisms contribute to the growth of agents’ capaci-
ties? For those interested in delving into this field
of study, we also summarize the commonly used
datasets or benchmarks for them to have convenient
access. To keep researchers updated on the latest
studies, we maintain an open-source GitHub repos-
itory, dedicated to outlining the research on LLM-
based multi-agent systems.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown re-
markable potential in reaching a level of reasoning and plan-
ning capabilities comparable to humans. This ability ex-
actly aligns with the expectations of humans for autonomous
agents that can perceive the surroundings, make decisions,
and take actions in response [Xiet al. , 2023; Wooldridge and
Jennings, 1995; Russell and Norvig, 2009; Guo et al. , 2023;
Liang et al. , 2023 ]. Hence, LLM-based agent has been stud-
ied and rapidly developed to understand and generate human-
like instructions, facilitating sophisticated interactions and

versity of Notre Dame.

2023; Shinn et al. , 2023; Li et al. , 2023d ]. Timely survey
papers systematically summarize the progress of LLM-based
agents, as seen in works [Xiet al. , 2023; Wang et al. , 2023b ].
Based on the inspiring capabilities of the single LLM-
based agent, LLM-based Multi-Agents have been proposed
to leverage the collective intelligence and specialized pro-
files and skills of multiple agents. Compared to systems us-
ing a single LLM-powered agent, multi-agent systems offer
advanced capabilities by 1) specializing LLMs into various
distinct agents, each with different capabilities, and 2) en-
abling interactions among these diverse agents to simulate
complex real-world environments effectively. In this context,
multiple autonomous agents collaboratively engage in plan-
ning, discussions, and decision-making, mirroring the co-
operative nature of human group work in problem-solving
tasks. This approach capitalizes on the communicative ca-
pabilities of LLMs, leveraging their ability to generate text
for communication and respond to textual inputs. Further-
more, it exploits LLMs’ extensive knowledge across vari-
ous domains and their latent potential to specialize in spe-
cific tasks. Recent research has demonstrated promising re-
sults in utilizing LLM-based multi-agents for solving vari-
ous tasks, such as software development [Hong et al. , 2023;
Qian et al. , 2023 ], multi-robot systems [Mandi et al. , 2023;
Zhang et al. , 2023c ], society simulation [Park et al. , 2023;
Park et al. , 2022 ], policy simulation [Xiao et al. , 2023;
Hua et al. , 2023 ], and game simulation [Xuet al. , 2023c;
Wang et al. , 2023c ]. Due to the nature of interdisciplinary
study in this field, it has attracted a diverse range of re-
searchers, expanding beyond AI experts to include those from
social science, psychology, and policy research. The vol-
ume of research papers is rapidly increasing, as shown in
Fig. 1 (inspired by the design in [Gao et al. , 2023b ]), thus
broadening the impact of LLM-based Multi-Agent research.
Nonetheless, earlier efforts were undertaken independently,
resulting in an absence of a systematic review to summarize
them, establish comprehensive blueprint of this field, and ex-
amine future research challenges. This underscores the sig-
nificance of our work and serves as the motivation behind pre-
senting this survey paper, dedicated to the research on LLM-
based multi-agent systems.
We expect that our survey can make significant contribu-
tions to both the research and development of LLMs and toarXiv:2402.01680v2  [cs.CL]  19 Apr 2024

Readers will gain a comprehensive overview of LLM-based
Multi-Agent (LLM-MA) systems, grasp the fundamental
concepts involved in establishing multi-agent systems based
on LLMs, and catch the latest research trends and applica-
tions in this dynamic field. We recognize that this field is in
its early stages and is rapidly evolving with fresh methodolo-
gies and applications. To provide a sustainable resource com-
plementing our survey paper, we maintain an open-source
GitHub repository1. We hope that our survey will inspire fur-
ther exploration and innovation in this field, as well as appli-
cations across a wide array of research disciplines.
To assist individuals from various backgrounds in under-
standing LLM-MA techniques and to complement existing
surveys by tackling unresolved questions, we have organized
our survey paper in the following manner. After laying out
the background knowledge in Section 2, we address a piv-
otal question: How are LLM-MA systems aligned with the
collaborative task-solving environment ? To answer this, we
present a comprehensive schema for positioning, differenti-
ating, and connecting various aspects of LLM-MA systems
inSection 3 . We delve into this question by discussing: 1)
theagents-environment interface , which details how agents
interact with the task environment; 2) agent profiling , which
explains how an agent is characterized by an LLM to behave
1https://github.com/taichengguo/LLM MultiAgents Survey Papersin specific ways; 3) agent communication , which examines
how agents exchange messages and collaborate; and 4) agent
capability acquisition , which explores how agents develop
their abilities to effectively solve problems. An additional
perspective for reviewing studies about LLM-MA is their ap-
plication. In Section 4 , we categorize current applications
into two primary streams: multi-agents for problem-solving
and multi-agents for world simulation . To guide individuals
in identifying appropriate tools and resources , we present
open-source implementation frameworks for studying LLM-
MA, as well as the usable datasets and benchmarks in Sec-
tion 5 . Based on the previous summary, we open the dis-
cussion for future research challenges and opportunities in
Section 6. The conclusions are summarized in Section 7.
2 Background
2.1 Single-Agent Systems Powered LLMs
We introduce the background by first outlining the capabili-
ties of a single-agent system based on LLMs, following the
discussion presented in [Weng, 2023 ].
Decision-making Thought: This term denotes the capabil-
ity of LLM-based agents, guided by prompts, to break down
complex tasks into smaller subgoals [Khot et al. , 2023 ], think
through each part methodically (sometimes exploring mul-
tiple paths) [Yao et al. , 2023 ], and learn from past experi-
ences [Shinn et al. , 2023 ]to perform better decision-making

--- PAGE 3 ---
on complex tasks. This capability enhances the autonomy
of a single LLM-based agent and bolsters its effectiveness in
problem-solving.
Tool-use: LLM-based agents’ tool-use capability allows
them to leverage external tools and resources to accom-
plish tasks, enhancing their functional capabilities and oper-
ate more effectively in diverse and dynamic environments [Li
et al. , 2023d; Ruan et al. , 2023; Gao et al. , 2023b ].
Memory: This ability refers to the capability of LLM-
based agent for conducting in-context learning [Dong et al. ,
2023a ]as short memory or external vector database [Lewis et
al., 2021 ]as long memory to preserve and retrieve informa-
tion over prolonged periods [Wang et al. , 2023b ]. This ability
enables a single LLM-based agent to maintain contextual co-
herence and enhance learning from interactions.
2.2 Single-Agent VS. Multi-Agent Systems
Single-Agent systems empowered by LLMs have shown in-
spiring cognitive abilities [Sumers et al. , 2023 ]. The con-
struction of such systems concentrates on formulating their
internal mechanisms and interactions with the external en-
vironment. Conversely, LLM-MA systems emphasize di-
verse agent profiles, inter-agent interactions, and collective
decision-making processes. From this perspective, more dy-
namic and complex tasks can be tackled by the collaboration
of multiple autonomous agents, each of which is equipped
with unique strategies and behaviors, and engaged in com-
munication with one another.
3 Dissecting LLM-MA Systems: Interface,
Profiling, Communication, and Capabilities
In this section, we delve into the intricacies of LLM-MA sys-
tems, where multiple autonomous agents engage in collabo-
rative activities akin to human group dynamics in problem-
solving scenarios. A critical inquiry we address is how
these LLM-MA systems are aligned to their operational envi-
ronments and the collective objectives they are designed to
achieve. To shed light on this, we present the general ar-
chitecture of these systems in Fig. 2. Our analysis dissects
the operational framework of these systems, focusing on four
key aspects: the agents-environment interface, agent profil-
ing, agent communication, and agent capability acquisition.
3.1 Agents-Environment Interface
The operational environments defines the specific contexts or
settings in which the LLM-MA systems are deployed and
interact. For example, these environments can be like soft-
ware development [Hong et al. , 2023 ], gaming [Mao et al. ,
2023 ], and various other domains such as financial markets
[Liet al. , 2023g ]or even social behavior modeling [Park et
al., 2023 ]. The LLM-based agents perceive and act within
the environment, which in turn influences their behavior and
decision making. For example, in the Werewolf Game simu-
lation, the sandbox environment sets the game’s framework,
including transitions from day to night, discussion periods,
voting mechanics, and reward rules. Agents, such as were-
wolves and the Seer, perform specific actions like killing orchecking roles. Following these actions, agents receive feed-
back from the environment, informing them of the game’s
current state. This information guides the agents in adjust-
ing their strategies over time, responding to the evolving
gameplay and interactions with other agents. The Agents-
Environment Interface refers to the way in which agents in-
teract with and perceive the environment. It’s through this
interface that agents understand their surroundings, make de-
cisions, and learn from the outcomes of their actions. We
categorize the current interfaces in LLM-MA systems into
three types, Sandbox, Physcial , and None , as detailed in Ta-
ble 1. The Sandbox refers to a simulated or virtual environ-
ment built by human where agents can interact more freely
and experiment with various actions and strategies. This kind
of interface is widely used in software development (code
interpreter as simulated environment) [Hong et al. , 2023 ],
gaming (using game rules as simulated environment) [Mao
et al. , 2023 ], etc. The Physical is a real-world environment
where agents interact with physical entities and obey real-
world physics and constraints. In physical space, agents nor-
mally need to take actions that can have direct physical out-
comes. For example, in tasks such as sweeping the floor,
making sandwiches, packing groceries, and arranging cab-
inets, robotic agents are required to perform actions itera-
tively, observe the physical environment, and continuously
refine their actions [Mandi et al. , 2023 ]. Lastly, None refers
to scenarios where there is no specific external environment,
and agents do not interact with any environment. For exam-
ple, many applications [Duet al. , 2023; Xiong et al. , 2023;
Chan et al. , 2023 ]utilize multiple agents to debate a ques-
tion to reach a consensus. These applications primarily focus
on communication among agents and do not depend on the
external environment.
3.2 Agents Profiling
In LLM-MA systems, agents are defined by their traits, ac-
tions, and skills, which are tailored to meet specific goals.
Across various systems, agents assume distinct roles, each
with comprehensive descriptions encompassing characteris-
tics, capabilities, behaviors, and constraints. For instance,
in gaming environments, agents might be profiled as players
with varying roles and skills, each contributing differently to
the game’s objectives. In software development, agents could
take on the roles of product managers and engineers, each
with responsibilities and expertise that guide the development
process. Similarly, in a debating platform, agents might be
designated as proponents, opponents, or judges, each with
unique functions and strategies to fulfill their roles effectively.
These profiles are crucial for defining the agents’ interactions
and effectiveness within their respective environments. Table
1 lists the agent Profiles in recent LLM-MA works.
Regarding the Agent Profiling Methods , we categorized
them into three types: Pre-defined, Model-Generated , and
Data-Derived . In the Pre-defined cases, agent profiles are
explicitly defined by the system designers. The Model-
Generated method creates agent profiles by models, e.g.,
large language models. The Data-Derived method involves
constructing agent profiles based on pre-existing datasets.

3.3 Agents Communication
The communication between agents in LLM-MA systems is
the critical infrastructure supporting collective intelligence.
We dissect agent communication from three perspectives: 1)
Communication Paradigms : the styles and methods of in-
teraction between agents; 2) Communication Structure : the
organization and architecture of communication networks
within the multi-agent system; and 3) Communication Con-
tentexchanged between agents.
Communication Paradigms: Current LLM-MA systems
mainly take three paradigms for communication: Coopera-
tive,Debate , and Competitive .Cooperative agents work to-
gether towards a shared goal or objectives, typically exchang-
ing information to enhance a collective solution. The Debate
paradigm is employed when agents engage in argumentative
interactions, presenting and defending their own viewpoints
or solutions, and critiquing those of others. This paradigm
is ideal for reaching a consensus or a more refined solution.
Competitive agents work towards their own goals that might
be in conflict with the goals of other agents.
Communication Structure: Fig. 3 shows four typical
communication structures in LLM-MA systems. Layered
communication is structured hierarchically, with agents at
each level having distinct roles and primarily interacting
within their layer or with adjacent layers. [Liuet al. , 2023 ]
introduces a framework called Dynamic LLM-Agent Net-
work (DyLAN), which organizes agents in a multi-layered
feed-forward network. This setup facilitates dynamic inter-
actions, incorporating features like inference-time agent se-
lection and an early-stopping mechanism, which collectively
enhance the efficiency of cooperation among agents. De-
centralized communication operates on a peer-to-peer net-

work, where agents directly communicate with each other,
a structure commonly employed in world simulation appli-
cations. Centralized communication involves a central agent
or a group of central agents coordinating the system’s com-
munication, with other agents primarily interacting through
this central node. Shared Message Pool is proposed by
MetaGPT [Hong et al. , 2023 ]to improve the communication
efficiency. This communication structure maintains a shared
message pool where agents publish messages and subscribe
to relevant messages based on their profiles, thereby boosting

--- PAGE 5 ---
communication efficiency.
Communication Content: In LLM-MA systems, the
Communication Content typically takes the form of text. The
specific content varies widely and depends on the particular
application. For example, in software development, agents
may communicate with each other about code segments. In
simulations of games like Werewolf, agents might discuss
their analyses, suspicions, or strategies.
3.4 Agents Capabilities Acquisition
The Agents Capabilities Acquisition is a crucial process in
LLM-MA, enabling agents to learn and evolve dynamically.
In this context, there are two fundamental concepts: the types
offeedback from which agents should learn to enhance their
capabilities, and the strategies for agents to adjust themselves
to effectively solve complex problems.
Feedback: Feedback involves the critical information that
agents receive about the outcome of their actions, helping the
agents learn the potential impact of their actions and adapt
to complex and dynamic problems. In most studies, the for-
mat of feedback provided to agents is textual. Based on the
sources from which agents receive this feedback, it can be
categorized into four types. 1) Feedback from Environ-
ment , e.g., from either real world environments or virtual
environments [Wang et al. , 2023b ]. It is prevalent in most
LLM-MA for problem-solving scenarios, including Software
Development (agents obtain feedback from Code Interpreter),
and Embodied multi-agents systems (robots obtain feedback
from real-world or Simulated environments). 2) Feedback
from Agents Interactions means that the feedback comes
from the judgement of other agents or from agents communi-
cations. It is common in problem-solving scenarios like sci-
ence debates, where agents learn to critically evaluate and re-
fine the conclusions through communications. In world sim-
ulation scenarios such as Game Simulation, agents learn to
refine strategies based on previous interactions between other
agents. 3) Human Feedback comes directly from humans
and is crucial for aligning the multi-agent system with hu-
man values and preferences. This kind of feedback is widely
used in most “Human-in-the-loop” applications [Wang et al. ,
2021 ]. Last 4) None . In some cases, there is no feedback pro-
vided to the agents. This often happens for world simulation
works focused on analyzing simulated results rather than the
planning capabilities of agents. In such scenarios, like prop-
agation simulation, the emphasis is on result analysis, and
hence, feedback is not a component of the system.
Agents Adjustment to Complex Problems: To enhance
their capabilities, agents in LLM-MA systems can adapt
through three main solutions. 1) Memory. Most LLM-
MA systems leverage a memory module for agents to ad-
just their behavior. Agents store information from previ-
ous interactions and feedback in their memory. When per-
forming actions, they can retrieve relevant, valuable memo-
ries, particularly those containing successful actions for simi-
lar past goals, as highlighted in [Wang et al. , 2023b ]. This
process aids in enhancing their current actions. 2) Self-
Evolution. Instead of only relying on the historical recordsto decide subsequent actions as seen in Memory -based solu-
tions, agents can dynamically self-evolve by modifying them-
selves such as altering their initial goals and planning strate-
gies, and training themselves based on feedback or commu-
nication logs. [Nascimento et al. , 2023 ]proposes a self-
control loop process to allow each agent in the multi-agents
systems to be self-managed and self-adaptive to dynamic en-
vironments, thereby improving the cooperation efficiency of
multiple agents. [Zhang et al. , 2023b ]introduces ProA-
gent which anticipates teammates’ decisions and dynami-
cally adjusts each agent’s strategies based on the communi-
cation logs between agents, facilitating mutual understand-
ing and improving collaborative planning capability. [Wang
et al. , 2023a ]discusses a Learning through Communication
(LTC) paradigm, using the communication logs of multi-
agents to generate datasets to train or fine-tune LLMs. LTC
enables continuous adaptation and improvement of agents
through interaction with their environments and other agents,
breaking the limits of in-context learning or supervised fine-
tuning, which don’t fully utilize the feedback received dur-
ing interactions with the environment and external tools
for continuous training. Self-Evolution enables agents’ au-
tonomous adjustment in their profiles or goals, rather than
just learning from historical interactions. 3) Dynamic Gen-
eration. In some scenarios, the system can generate new
agents on-the-fly during its operation [Chen et al. , 2023a;
Chen et al. , 2023c ]. This capability enables the system to
scale and adapt effectively, as it can introduce agents that are
specifically designed to address current needs and challenges.
With the scaling up LLM-MA with a larger number of
agents, the escalating complexity of managing various kinds
of agents has been a critical problem. Agents Orchestration
emerged as a pivotal challenge and began to gain attention
in[Moura, 2023; Dibia, 2023 ]. We will further discuss this
topic in Section 6.4.
4 Applications
LLM-MA systems have been used in a wide range of appli-
cations. We summarize two kinds of applications in Table 1:
Problem Solving andWorld Simulation . We elaborate on
these applications below. Note that this is a fast growing re-
search field and new applications appear almost everyday. We
maintain an open source repository to report the latest work.
4.1 LLM-MA for Problem Solving
The main motivation of using LLM-MA for problem solving
is to harness the collective capabilities of agents with spe-
cialized expertise. These agents, each acting as individuals,
collaborate to address complex problems effectively, such as
software development, embodied agents, science experiments
and science debate. These application examples are intro-
duced next.
4.1.1 Software Development
Given that software development is a complex endeavor re-
quiring the collaboration of various roles like product man-
agers, programmers, and testers, LLM-MA systems are typ-
ically set to emulate these distinct roles and collaborate to
address the intricate challenge. Following the waterfall or

Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) workflow of the
software development, the communication structure among
agents is usually layered. Agents generally interact with the
code interpreter, other agents or human to iteratively refine
the generated code. [Liet al. , 2023b ]first proposes a sim-
ple role-play agent framework, which utilizes the interplay
of two roles to realize autonomous programming based on
one-sentence user instruction. It provides insights into the
“cognitive” processes of communicative agents. [Dong et al. ,
2023b ]makes LLMs work as distinct “experts” for sub-tasksin software development, autonomously collaborating to gen-
erate code. Moreover, [Qian et al. , 2023 ]presents an end-to-
end framework for software development, utilizing multiple
agents for software development without incorporating ad-
vanced human teamwork experience. [Hong et al. , 2023 ]first
incorporates human workflow insights for more controlled
and validated performance. It encodes SOPs into prompts to
enhance structured coordination. [Huang et al. , 2023a ]delves
deeper into multi-agent based programming by solving the
problem of balancing code snippet generation with effective

test case generation, execution, and optimization.
4.1.2 Embodied Agents
Most embodied agents applications inherently utilize multi-
ple robots working together to perform complex real-world
planning and manipulation tasks such as warehouse manage-
ment with heterogeneous robot capabilities. Hence, LLM-
MA can be used to model robots with different capabilities
and cooperate with each other to solve real-world physical
tasks. [Dasgupta et al. , 2023 ]first explores the potential to
use LLM as an action planner for embedded agents. [Mandi
et al. , 2023 ]introduces RoCo, a novel approach for multi-
robot collaboration that uses LLMs for high-level commu-
nication and low-level path planning. Each robotic arm is
equipped with an LLM, cooperating with inverse kinemat-
ics and collision checking. Experimental results demonstrate
the adaptability and success of RoCo in collaborative tasks.
[Zhang et al. , 2023c ]presents CoELA, a Cooperative Em-
bodied Language Agent, managing discussions and task plan-
ning in an LLM-MA setting. This challenging setting is
featured with decentralized control, complex partial observa-
tion, costly communication, and multi-objective long-horizon
tasks. [Chen et al. , 2023d ]investigates communication chal-
lenges in scenarios involving a large number of robots, as
assigning each robot an LLM will be costly and unpracti-
cal due to the long context. The study compares four com-
munication frameworks, centralized, decentralized, and two
hybrid models, to evaluate their effectiveness in coordinating
complex multi-agent tasks. [Yuet al. , 2023 ]proposes Co-
NavGPT for multi-robot cooperative visual target navigation,
integrating LLM as a global planner to assign frontier goals
to each robot. [Chen et al. , 2023b ]proposes an LLM-based
consensus-seeking framework, which can be applied as a co-
operative planner to a multi-robot aggregation task.
4.1.3 Science Experiments
Like multiple agents play as different specialists and cooper-
ate to solve the Software Development and Embodied Agents
problem, multiple agents can also be used to form a science
team to conduct science experiments. One important differ-
ence from previous applications lies in the crucial role of hu-
man oversight, due to the high expenses of the science ex-
periments and the hallucination of the LLM agents. Human
experts are at the center of these agents to process the infor-
mation of agents and give feedback to the agents. [Zheng et
al., 2023 ]utilizes multiple LLM-based agents, each focusing
on specific tasks for the science experiments including strat-
egy planning, literature search, coding, robotic operations,
and labware design. All these agents interact with humans
to work collaboratively to optimize the synthesis process of
complex materials.
4.1.4 Science Debate
LLM-MA can be set for science debating scenarios, where
agents debate with each other to enhance the collective rea-
soning capabilities in tasks such as Massive Multitask Lan-
guage Understanding (MMLU) [Hendrycks et al. , 2020 ],
Math problems [Cobbe et al. , 2021 ], and StrategyQA [Geva
et al. , 2021 ]. The main idea is that each agent initially of-
fers its own analysis of a problem, which is then followedby a joint debating process. Through multiple rounds of de-
bate, the agents converge on a single, consensus answer. [Du
et al. , 2023 ]leverages the multi-agents debate process on a
set of six different reasoning and factual accuracy tasks and
demonstrates that LLM-MA debating can improve factual-
ity. [Xiong et al. , 2023 ]focuses on the commonsense rea-
soning tasks and formulates a three-stage debate to align with
real-world scenarios including fair debate, mismatched de-
bate, and roundtable debate. The paper also analyzes the
inter-consistency between different LLMs and claims that de-
bating can improve the inter-consistency. [Tang et al. , 2023 ]
also utilizes multiple LLM-based agents as distinct domain
experts to do the collaborative discussion on a medical report
to reach a consensus for medical diagnosis.
4.2 LLM-MA for World Simulation
Another mainstream application scenario of LLM-MA is the
world simulation. Research in this area is rapidly growing
and spans a diverse range of fields including social sciences,
gaming, psychology, economics, policy-making, etc. The key
reason for employing LLM-MA in world simulations lies in
their exceptional role-playing abilities, which are crucial for
realistically depicting various roles and viewpoints in a sim-
ulated world. The environment of world simulation projects
is usually crafted to reflect the specific scenario being simu-
lated, with agents designed in various profiles to match this
context. Unlike the problem solving systems that focus on
agent cooperation, world simulation systems involve diverse
methods of agent management and communication, reflecting
the complexity and variety of real-world interactions. Next,
we explore simulations conducted in diverse fields.
4.2.1 Societal Simulation
In societal simulation, LLM-MA models are used to simu-
late social behaviors, aiming to explore the potential social
dynamics and propagation, test social science theories, and
populate virtual spaces and communities with realistic social
phenomena [Park et al. , 2023 ]. Leveraging LLM’s capabili-
ties, agents with unique profiles engage in extensive commu-
nication, generating rich behavioral data for in-depth social
science analysis.
The scale of societal simulation has expanded over time,
beginning with smaller, more intimate settings and progress-
ing to larger, more intricate ones. Initial work by [Park et al. ,
2023 ]introduces generative agents within an interactive sand-
box environment reminiscent of the sims, allowing end users
to engage with a modest community of 25 agents through nat-
ural language. At the same time, [Park et al. , 2022 ]develops
Social Simulacra, which constructs a simulated community
of 1,000 personas. This system takes a designer’s vision for
a community—its goals, rules, and member personas—and
simulates it, generating behaviors like posting, replying, and
even anti-social actions. Building on this, [Gao et al. , 2023a ]
takes the concept further by constructing vast networks com-
prising 8,563 and 17,945 agents, respectively, designed to
simulate social networks focused on the topics of Gender Dis-
crimination and Nuclear Energy. This evolution showcases
the increasing complexity and size of simulated environments
in recent research. Recent studies such as [Chen et al. , 2023b;

--- PAGE 8 ---
Kaiya et al. , 2023; Li et al. , 2023a; Li et al. , 2023f; Ziems et
al., 2023 ]highlight the evolving complexity in multi-agent
systems, LLM impacts on social networks, and their integra-
tion into social science research.
4.2.2 Gaming
LLM-MA is well-suited for creating simulated gaming en-
vironments, allowing agents to assume various roles within
games. This technology enables the development of con-
trolled, scalable, and dynamic settings that closely mimic
human interactions, making it ideal for testing a range of
game theory hypotheses [Mao et al. , 2023; Xu et al. , 2023b;
Gong et al. , 2023 ]. Most games simulated by LLM-MA rely
heavily on natural language communication, offering a sand-
box environment within different game settings for exploring
or testing game theory hypotheses including reasoning, coop-
eration, persuasion, deception, leadership, etc.
[Akata et al. , 2023 ]leverages behavioral game theory to
examine LLMs’ behavior in interactive social settings, partic-
ularly their performance in games like the iterated Prisoner’s
Dilemma and Battle of the Sexes. Furthermore, [Xuet al. ,
2023b ]proposes a framework using ChatArena library [Wu
et al. , 2023b ]for engaging LLMs in communication games
like Werewolf, using retrieval and reflection on past commu-
nications for improvement, as well as the Chain-of-Thought
mechanism [Weiet al. , 2022 ].[Light et al. , 2023b ]explores
the potential of LLM agents in playing Resistance Avalon, in-
troducing A V ALONBENCH, a comprehensive game environ-
ment and benchmark for further developing advanced LLMs
and multi-agent frameworks. [Wang et al. , 2023c ]also fo-
cuses on the capabilities of LLM Agents in dealing with mis-
information in the Avalon game, proposing the Recursive
Contemplation (ReCon) framework to enhance LLMs’ ability
to discern and counteract deceptive information. [Xuet al. ,
2023c ]introduces a framework combining LLMs with rein-
forcement learning (RL) to develop strategic language agents
for the Werewolf game. It introduces a new approach to use
RL policy in the case that the action and state sets are not pre-
defined but in the natural language setting. [Mukobi et al. ,
2023 ]designs the “Welfare Diplomacy”, a general-sum vari-
ant of the zero-sum board game Diplomacy, where players
must balance military conquest and domestic welfare. It also
offers an open-source benchmark, aiming to help improve the
cooperation ability of multi-agent AI systems. On top of that,
there is a work [Liet al. , 2023c ]in a multi-agent cooperative
text game testing the agents’ Theory of Mind (ToM), the abil-
ity to reason about the concealed mental states of others and
is fundamental to human social interactions, collaborations,
and communications. [Fanet al. , 2023 ]comprehensively as-
sesses the capability of LLMs as rational players, and iden-
tifies the weaknesses of LLM-based Agents that even in the
explicit game process, agents may still overlook or modify
refined beliefs when taking actions.
4.2.3 Psychology
In psychological simulation studies, like in the societal simu-
lation, multiple agents are utilized to simulate humans with
various traits and thought processes. However, unlike so-
cietal simulations, one approach in psychology involves di-
rectly applying psychological experiments to these agents.This method focuses on observing and analyzing their varied
behaviors through statistical methods. Here, each agent op-
erates independently, without interacting with others, essen-
tially representing different individuals. Another approach
aligns more closely with societal simulations, where multiple
agents interact and communicate with each other. In this sce-
nario, psychological theories are applied to understand and
analyze the emergent behavioral patterns. This method fa-
cilitates the study of interpersonal dynamics and group be-
haviors, providing insights into how individual psychological
traits influence collective actions. [Maet al. , 2023 ]explores
the psychological implications and outcomes of employing
LLM-based conversational agents for mental well-being sup-
port. It emphasizes the need for carefully evaluating the use
of LLM-based agents in mental health applications from a
psychological perspective. [Kova ˇcet al. , 2023 ]introduces
a tool named SocialAI school for creating interactive envi-
ronments simulating social interactions. It draws from devel-
opmental psychology to understand how agents can acquire,
demonstrate, and evolve social skills such as joint attention,
communication, and cultural learning. [Zhang et al. , 2023d ]
explores how LLM agents, with distinct traits and thinking
patterns, emulate human-like social behaviors such as confor-
mity and majority rule. This integration of psychology into
the understanding of agent collaboration offers a novel lens
for examining and enhancing the mechanisms behind LLM-
based multi-agents systems. [Aher et al. , 2023 ]introduces
Turing Experiments to evaluate the extent to which large lan-
guage models can simulate different aspects of human behav-
iors. The Turing Experiments replicate classical experiments
and phenomena in psychology, economics, and sociology us-
ing a question-answering format to mimic experimental con-
ditions. They also design a prompt that is used to simulate
the responses of multiple different individuals by varying the
name. By simulating various kinds of individuals via LLM,
they show that larger models replicate human behavior more
faithfully, but they also reveal a hyper-accuracy distortion, es-
pecially in knowledge-based tasks.
4.2.4 Economy
LLM-MA is used to simulate economic and financial trading
environments mainly because it can serve as implicit com-
putational models of humans. In these simulations, agents
are provided with endowments, and information, and set with
pre-defined preferences, allowing for an exploration of their
actions in economic and financial contexts. This is similar to
the way economists model ’homo economicus’, the character-
ization of man in some economic theories as a rational person
who pursues wealth for his own self-interest [Horton, 2023 ].
There are several studies demonstrate the diverse applications
of LLM-MA in simulating economic scenarios, encompass-
ing macroeconomic activities, information marketplaces, fi-
nancial trading, and virtual town simulations. Agents in-
teract in cooperative or debate, decentralized environments.
[Liet al. , 2023e ]employs LLMs for macroeconomic simu-
lation, featuring prompt-engineering-driven agents that emu-
late human-like decision-making, thereby enhancing the real-
ism of economic simulations compared to rule-based or other
AI agents. [Anonymous, 2023 ]explores the buyer’s inspec-

presents an LLM-MA framework for financial trading, em-
phasizing a layered memory system, debate mechanisms, and
individualized trading characters, thereby fortifying decision-
making robustness. [Zhao et al. , 2023 ]utilizes LLM-based
Agents to simulate a virtual town with restaurant and cus-
tomer agents, yielding insights aligned with sociological and
economic theories. These studies collectively illuminate the
broad spectrum of applications and advancements in employ-
ing LLMs for diverse economic simulation scenarios.
4.2.5 Recommender Systems
The use of the LLM-MA in recommender systems is similar
to that in psychology since studies in both fields involve the
consideration of extrinsic and intrinsic human factors such as
cognitive processes and personality [Lex and Schedl, 2022 ].
One way to use LLM-MA in recommender systems is to di-
rectly introduce items to multiple LLM-based agents within
diverse traits and conduct statistics of the preferences of dif-
ferent agents. Another way is to treat both users and items
as agents and the user-item communication as interactions,
simulating the preference propagation. To bridge the gap be-
tween offline metrics and real-world performance in recom-
mendation systems, Agent4Rec [Zhang et al. , 2023a ]intro-
duces a simulation platform based on LLM-MA. 1000 gener-
ative agents are initialized with the MovieLens-1M dataset to
simulate complex user interactions in a recommendation en-
vironment. Agent4Rec shows that LLM-MA can effectively
mimic real user preferences and behaviors, provide insights
into phenomena like the filter bubble effect, and help uncovercausal relationships in recommendation tasks. In Agent4Rec
work, agents are used to simulate users and they do not com-
municate with each other. Different from Agent4Rec work,
[Zhang et al. , 2023e ]treats both users and items as agents,
optimizing them collectively to reflect and adjust to real-
world interaction disparities. This work emphasizes simulat-
ing user-item interactions and propagates preferences among
agents, capturing the collaborative filtering essence.
4.2.6 Policy Making
Similar to simulations in gaming and economic scenarios,
Policy Making requires strong decision-making capabilities
to realistic and dynamic complex problems. LLM-MA can
be used to simulate the policy making via simulating a virtual
government or simulating the impact of various policies on
different communities. These simulations provide valuable
insights into how policies are formulated and their potential
effects, aiding policymakers in understanding and anticipat-
ing the consequences of their decisions [Farmer and Axtell,
2022 ]. The research outlined in [Xiao et al. , 2023 ]is cen-
tered on simulating a township water pollution crisis. It sim-
ulated a town located on an island including a demographic
structure of different agents and township head and advisor.
Within the water pollution crisis simulation, this work pro-
vides an in-depth analysis of how a virtual government entity
might respond to such a public administration challenge and
how information transfer in the social network in this crisis.
[Hua et al. , 2023 ]introduces WarAgent to simulate key his-
torical conflicts and provides insights for conflict resolution
and understanding, with potential applications in preventing
future international conflicts.

--- PAGE 10 ---
4.2.7 Disease Propagation Simulation
Leveraging the societal simulation capabilities of LLM-MA
can also be used to simulate disease propagation. The most
recent study in [Williams et al. , 2023 ]delves into the use of
LLM-MA in simulating disease spread. The research show-
cases through various simulations how these LLM-based
agents can accurately emulate human responses to disease
outbreaks, including behaviors like self-quarantine and iso-
lation during heightened case numbers. The collective be-
havior of these agents mirrors the complex patterns of multi-
ple waves typically seen in pandemics, eventually stabilizing
into an endemic state. Impressively, their actions contribute
to the attenuation of the epidemic curve. [Ghaffarzadegan et
al., 2023 ]also discusses the epidemic propagation simulation
and decomposes the simulation into two parts: the Mechanis-
tic Model which represents the information or propagation of
the virus and the Decision-Making Model which represents
the agents’ decision-making process when facing the virus.
5 Implementation Tools and Resources
5.1 Multi-Agents Framework
We provide a detailed introduction to three open-source
multi-agent frameworks: MetaGPT [Hong et al. , 2023 ],
CAMEL [Liet al. , 2023b ], and Autogen [Wuet al. , 2023a ].
They are all frameworks that utilize language models for
complex task-solving with a focus on multi-agent collabora-
tion, but they differ in their approaches and applications.
MetaGPT is designed to embed human workflow processes
into the operation of language model agents, thereby reducing
the hallucination problem that often arises in complex tasks.
It does this by encoding Standard Operating Procedures into
the system and using an assembly line approach to assign spe-
cific roles to different agents.
CAMEL, or Communicative Agent Framework, is oriented
towards facilitating autonomous cooperation among agents.
It uses a novel technique called inception prompting to guide
conversational agents towards fulfilling tasks that are consis-
tent with human objectives. This framework also serves as a
tool for generating and studying conversational data, help-
ing researchers understand how communicative agents be-
have and interact.
AutoGen is a versatile framework that allows for the cre-
ation of applications using language models. It is distinctive
for its high level of customization, enabling developers to pro-
gram agents using both natural language and code to define
how these agents interact. This versatility enables its use in
diverse fields, from technical areas such as coding and math-
ematics to consumer-focused sectors like entertainment.
More recently, [Chen et al. , 2023c; Chen et al. , 2023a ]
introduce frameworks for dynamic multi-agent collabora-
tion, while [Zhou et al. , 2023a; Li et al. , 2023h; Xie et
al., 2023 ]present platforms and libraries for building au-
tonomous agents, emphasizing their adaptability in task-
solving and social simulations.
5.2 Datasets and Benchmarks
We summarize commonly used datasets or benchmarks for
LLM-MA study in Table 2. We observe that different re-search applications use different datasets and benchmarks.
In the Problem solving scenarios, most datasets and bench-
marks are used to evaluate the planning and reasoning capa-
bilities by Multiple agents cooperation or debate. In World
Simulation scenarios, datasets and benchmarks are used to
evaluate the alignment between the simulated world and real-
world or analyze the behaviors of different agents. However,
in certain research applications like Science Team operations
for experiments and economic modeling, there is still a need
for comprehensive benchmarks. The development of such
benchmarks would greatly enhance the ability to gauge the
success and applicability of LLM-MA in these complex and
dynamic fields.
6 Challenges and Opportunities
Studies of LLM-MA frameworks and applications are ad-
vancing rapidly, giving rise to numerous challenges and op-
portunities. We identified several critical challenges and po-
tential areas for future study.
6.1 Advancing into Multi-Modal Environment
Most previous work on LLM-MA has been focused on text-
based environments, excelling in processing and generating
text. However, there is a notable lack in multi-modal set-
tings, where agents would interact with and interpret data
from multiple sensory inputs and generate multiple outputs
such as images, audio, video, and physical actions. Inte-
grating LLMs into multi-modal environments presents addi-
tional challenges, such as processing diverse data types and
enabling agents to understand each other and respond to more
than just textual information.
6.2 Addressing Hallucination
The hallucination problem is a significant challenge in LLMs
and single LLM-based Agent systems. It refers to the phe-
nomenon where the model generates text that is factually in-
correct [Huang et al. , 2023b ]. However, this problem takes
on an added layer of complexity in a multi-agent setting. In
such scenarios, one agent’s hallucination can have a cascad-
ing effect. This is due to the interconnected nature of multi-
agent systems, where misinformation from one agent can be
accepted and further propagated by others in the network.
Therefore, detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM-
MA is not just a crucial task but also presents a unique set
of challenges. It involves not only correcting inaccuracies at
the level of individual agents but also managing the flow of
information between agents to prevent the spread of these in-
accuracies throughout the system.
6.3 Acquiring Collective Intelligence
In traditional multi-agent systems, agents often use reinforce-
ment learning to learn from offline training datasets. How-
ever, LLM-MA systems mainly learn from instant feedback,
such as interactions with the environment or humans, as we
discussed in Section 3. This learning style requires a reli-
able interactive environment and it would be tricky to design
such an interactive environment for many tasks, limiting the
scalability of LLM-MA systems. Moreover, the prevailing

--- PAGE 11 ---
approaches in current research involve employing Memory
and Self-Evolution techniques to adjust agents based on feed-
back. While effective for individual agents, these methods do
not fully capitalize on the potential collective intelligence of
the agent network. They adjust agents in isolation, overlook-
ing the synergistic effects that can emerge from coordinated
multi-agent interactions. Hence, jointly adjusting multiple
agents and achieving optimal collective intelligence is still a
critical challenge for LLM-MA.
6.4 Scaling Up LLM-MA Systems
LLM-MA systems are composed of a number of individual
LLM-based agents, posing a significant challenge of scala-
bility regarding the number of agents. From the computa-
tional complexity perspective, each LLM-based agent, typ-
ically built on large language models like GPT-4, demands
substantial computational power and memory. Scaling up the
number of these agents in an LLM-MA system significantly
increases resource requirements. In scenarios with limited
computational resource, it would be challenging to develop
these LLM-MA systems.
Additionally, as the number of agents in an LLM-MA sys-
tem increases, additional complexities and research opportu-
nities emerge, particularly in areas like efficient agent coor-
dination, communication, and understanding the scaling laws
of multi-agents. For instance, with more LLM-based agents,
the intricacy of ensuring effective coordination and commu-
nication rises significantly. As highlighted in [Dibia, 2023 ],
designing advanced Agents Orchestration methodologies is
increasingly important. These methodologies aim to opti-
mize agents workflows, task assignments tailored to differ-
ent agents, and communication patterns across agents such as
communication constraints between agents. Effective Agents
Orchestration facilitates harmonious operation among agents,
minimizing conflicts and redundancies. Additionally, explor-
ing and defining the scaling laws that govern the behavior and
efficiency of multi-agent systems as they grow larger remains
an important area of research. These aspects highlight the
need for innovative solutions to optimize LLM-MA systems,
making them both effective and resource-efficient.
6.5 Evaluation and Benchmarks
We have summarized the datasets and benchmarks currently
available for LLM-MA in Table 2. This is a starting point, and
far from being comprehensive. We identify two significant
challenges in evaluating LLM-MA systems and benchmark-
ing their performance against each other. Firstly, as discussed
in[Xuet al. , 2023a ], much of the existing research focuses
on evaluating individual agents’ understanding and reason-
ing within narrowly defined scenarios. This focus tends to
overlook the broader and more complex emergent behaviors
that are integral to multi-agent systems. Secondly, there is a
notable shortfall in the development of comprehensive bench-
marks across several research domains, such as Science Team
for Experiment Operations, Economic analysis, and Disease
propagation simulation. This gap presents an obstacle to ac-
curately assessing and benchmarking the full capabilities of
LLM-MA systems in these varied and crucial fields.6.6 Applications and Beyond
The potential of LLM-MA systems extends far beyond their
current applications, holding great promise for advanced
computational problem-solving in fields such as finance, edu-
cation, healthcare, environmental science, urban planning and
so on. As we have discussed, LLM-MA systems possess the
capability to tackle complex problems and simulate various
aspects of the real world. While the current role-playing ca-
pabilities of LLMs may have limitations, ongoing advance-
ments in LLM technology suggest a bright future. It is an-
ticipated to have more sophisticated methodologies, applica-
tions, datasets, and benchmarks tailored for diverse research
fields. Furthermore, there are opportunities to explore LLM-
MA systems from various theoretical perspectives, such as
Cognitive Science [Sumers et al. , 2023 ], Symbolic Artificial
Intelligence, Cybernetics, Complex Systems, and Collective
Intelligence. Such a multi-faceted approach could contribute
to a more comprehensive understanding and innovative appli-
cations in this rapidly evolving field.
7 Conclusion
LLM-based Multi-Agents have shown inspiring collective in-
telligence and rapidly garnered increasing interest among re-
searchers. In this survey, we first systematically review the
development of LLM-MA systems by positioning, differen-
tiating, and connecting them from various aspects, regard-
ing the agents-environment interface, the characterization of
agents by LLMs, the strategies for managing agent communi-
cation and the paradigms for capability acquisition. We also
summarized LLM-MA applications for problem-solving and
world simulation. By also highlighting the commonly used
datasets and benchmarks and discussing challenges and fu-
ture opportunities, we hope that this survey can serve as a use-
ful resource for researchers across various research fields, in-
spiring future research to explore the potential of LLM-based
Multi-Agents.
